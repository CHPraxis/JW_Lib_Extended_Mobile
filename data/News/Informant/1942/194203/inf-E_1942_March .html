<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Done Your Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Toward the Quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are now In the midst of the great </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Campaign of 1942. There is every reason to believe that this will be the greatest of all </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font0"> Campaigns, but. of course, that depends upon the efforts contributed by each individual Theocratic publisher. That this is not the first </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Campaign is no cause for any publisher to think It Is unimportant, but the very fact that the Lord has arranged a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Campaign every year for the past four years emphasizes it, and. further, that Jehovah has kept the way open for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> to get into many countries where it is impossible to ship any quantities of books and booklets is conclusive evidence that this campaign is very important, and should be carefully participated in by every servant of the Most High God, and that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> contains the necessary message that He wants His people to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">QUOTAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As an individual publisher, what have you accomplished during the first month of this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font0">Campaign? During February did you, as a company publisher, place one subscription, seven books and eighty booklets? Or, as a pioneer, did you obtain four subscriptions and place forty books and four hundred booklets? Right now is the time to check this carefully. If you find that you have fallen behind this quota, there is still time to make it up during the remaining two months of March and April. There does not seem to be any good reason why each publisher can't make his personal quota, whether as a company publisher or a pioneer publisher. If you didn't place your quota, don't be discouraged, but put forth a little more effort, and you will undoubtedly have the Lord's blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of 1he company publishers fail to keep a record or close check on their individual activities; but during a campaign of such importance as a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Campaign every publisher should do this. It is the only way you w ill know whether you base reached junr quota or not. Those brethren who have not done it can check with the company secretary and obtain the information. ‘Then during March and April keep up a record of your report and compare it alongside the quota, and don't lag behind. If you see you are not keeping up, step up your activities until you catch up. Watch the books and booklets closely’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Portions of the service meetings should be regularly devoted to the progress of the company as a vvhole.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Campaign</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Do your best to keep pace with the quota. If exery publisher and every company faithfully compare activity or results alongside of quotas, and then work accordingly, we are certain io surpass our three-month quota of 100,000 subscriptions, 1 .IMJO.OOO books, and 12.000.000 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ai the lime of going (o press we liaxe already receixed 13.840 new subscriptions obtained during the first few days of the campaign. The mail at the olliee is very heavy, and we rejoice in tlie large number of subscriptions sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">HAVE YOU DONE IT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Have you visited with the special Offer all of the people whose names are In your back-call file? Are your </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Childien</span><span class="font0"> study groups 100 percent subscribers? Have you explained the offer to your local merchants—the grocer, the butcher, the laundryman, the tailor, the milkman, the cobbler, tlie baker, the service station attendants? Did you forget your doctor, your dentist, the postman, or someone else to whom you speak frequently? Does every’ publisher in your family subscribe? (There is a good reason why each should.) While most of the subscriptions will undoubtedly be obtained in the door-to-door and back-call work, before this campaign has come to a conclusion make sure you have offered </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> to all of these persons and whomsoever else you might have occasion to meet in your daily routine. Make it a point to carry a copy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer </span><span class="font0">and some subscription blanks with you xvherever you go, and be prepared to tell everyone. Don't forget </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contolalion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every person subscribing for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> is a good prospect for starting a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font0"> study. When you visit these new subscribers encourage </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">them to</span><span class="font0"> read by bringing out some point you have just read in the latesl issue. Try to have them accompany you to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoner</span><span class="font0"> studv at your local Kingdom Hall. Although 'this is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Campaign, keep constantly in mind the organizing of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font0">studies as of first importance, and push this work xvith all diligence and never miss an opportunity to start a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The final gathering is on. 1’eople of good-will must become educated along Theocratic lines M&gt;xr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font0">an? instruments the I,ord Ims glxen us to so use. Just how long the Lord xx ill permit the ’'strange work” to go on xxe do not know, but it seems that it xxill not be for very long.

<p><span class="font0">It appears that now the Ixird is educating His servants and the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Excellent Witness Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Publishers Conducting 2,604 Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the month of January’ the special publishers were greatly-blessed of Jehovah, 990 of them participating in the field work and reporting to this office, averaging 174.3 hours each. These brethren conducted 2,604 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font0"> studies, xvith an attendance of more than 8,700 people. They made 03.777 baek-calls, or an average of 64.4 back-calls for each publisher during the month. This is a splendid report and indicates that the Lord’s willing volunteers are lending themselves wholeheartedly and xvith everything they have to the Theocratic service and that the Lord's rich blessing is upon their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is brought out in greater contrast when the activity of this little band is compared with the activity of the general pioneer publishers xvho are also expected to devote their entire time to the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">General Special Pioneer Publishers</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font2">Publishers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;990</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font2">” booklets per hour .57</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font0">This cleaily indicates what Can be done if the effort is put forth. General pioneer publishers who agree to meet a requirement of 150 hours a month and xvho average only 103 hours a month, which is a bare two-thirds of their agreement, cannot be said to be lending themselves wholeheartedly to the Kingdom re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignment to Companies of New Booklet “Hope”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Should Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new 64-page, self-covered booklet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font0"> is being consigned to each company in the country xvhose account is in good condition. The importance of the message contained in this booklet makes it imperative that it receive a wide and Intense distribution as soon as possible. We hope to have this booklet in the hands of all the companies before “&lt;'h u.PBEN of The King&quot; Testimony Period begins, April 1. The campaign with the booklet begins on that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because of the fact that companies are receiving consignments, it will not be necessary for them to order. Pioneers, however, are not getting a consignment, and they should send in their orders immediately. These orders, as far as possible, should be combined with company and other pioneer orders to make up hundredpound shipments. However, if a pioneer is isolated and cannot arrange for a hundred-pound shipment, his order for this booklet should not be held up, but should be sent in immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">quirements, and as a consequence their efforts are not being blessed with the results that the special publishers are obtaining. There is much food for serious thought in this, when each is to bear his own burden and stand blameless before the Lord in this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">INCREASING SPECIAL PUBLISHER RANKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Society is arranging to put on 400 or 500 more special publishers in order to push the Kingdom activity with energy and zeal while we have an opportunity. A careful check has been made of the general pioneer records for qualified brethren to serve as special publishers. Only those brethren are chosen who have been on the pioneer list for some time and xvhose field activity of hours, back-calls and general use of sound equipment shows them to be qualified for this type of work.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Please Read Carefully</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">The Society has furnished several forms for company servants and pioneers to use. anil we would appreciate very much if you would use the forms just as they are instead of making alterations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remittance Form : This form, SC-52, should be sent in with all remittances that are not sent in witli orders. No changes or additions should be made on the printed form SC-52. I'lease do not use the remittance form as an order blank. When a remittance accompanies an order, you should combine the total for cash items and the amount to be applied on the company account as “Company stock account’’ on the remittance form SC-52. All items ordered. whettier you send in casli or wish the items to be charged to your account, should be listed on a regular order blank S-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine distributor account remittances should be divided according to the number of copies of each magazine you are paying for. Do not show in a lump sum the remittance for magazines. Separate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoirer</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font0"> monies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The total of the amounts shown on the form should equal the total of the remittance you enclose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will aid the correspondence clerks to give better attention to your mail if you do not mix remittances with correspondence pertaining to service activities or other matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Use the regular remittance form for remittances. Use order blanks for orders. Write other matters on separate sheets of paper, giving each paper a heading, such as Service, Pioneer Desk, Legal Desk. This will insure prompt distribution of the various subjects to be treated and each will go to the proper desk for handling. If many items are Included in one continuous letter they will lie handled one at a time and be passed on from desk to desk, which often takes much time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We appreciate your letters, but if you will make them brief and to the point it will save considerable reading. If everything in the envelope pertains exclusively to legal matters, or service, or reports, or territory, we suggest that such designation be written on the envelope, and it will go to the proper desk immediately. All other correspondence goes to one desk for sorting and handling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many companies and pioneers have been negligent in handling subscriptions according to the instructions in the January </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font0"> These instructions should be studied and the Subscription Record Sheet (S-10) provided by the Society be used for entering subscriptions. It will save time. The ones responsible for sending in subscriptions to the Brooklyn office should check these instructions carefully. Re sure your return address is on each letter written.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Many brethren, particularly special publishers and general pioneer publishers, are organizing new companies, and when the time comes to start the company they simply write the Society that they are starting a new company and give the names of some individuals who might serve. This information is not sulhcient for our records. When you are ready to organize a company, please write the Society for a company organization application form. This will be forwarded and when properly filled out will supply the required information for our files. Therefore, kindly follow this procedure in the future when organizing new companies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The effort of the demons is to scatter the I,ord’s sheep and to wean and lure them away from the Lord’s Theocratic organization and thereby cause them to fail of performance in the Lord’s “strange work&quot;. &quot;He that gathereth not with me scatter-eth,&quot; and the Lord is using His organization in the gathering work. Instances are now reported that <sup>!</sup> since the death of Brother Ruther-! ford agents of the &quot;evil servant” class, which regarded Brother Ruth-j erf ord as a barrier and as an object of personal offense, are now calling <sup>!</sup> at the homes of the Theocratic publishers and making inquiries as to the locations of meetings being conducted in the homes. The intent is plainly a demonic effort to infiltrate into the ranks of the newly interested and busily-occupied &quot;sheep” and then to try to cause doubts, misgivings, suspicions, divisions, controversies. and other schemes of the chief of demons to break up the unity and to distract their attention from the Lord's table and from the work which it is the life-or-death obligation of God’s covenant people to perform. The faithful will safeguard the Kingdom interests and will resist these efforts of the demons by refusing to give oat any information to the crafty agents of the &quot;evil servant” or other religionists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">While the greatest number of pioneers ever enrolled are now proclaiming the Kingdom message as general and special publishers, there is still plenty of territory. The way the work is being carried on today, of concentrating their efforts in a given district or small town, there is much work to do and it takes much time, with each publisher covering less territory. The special publishers, according to their reports in this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font0"> show what wonderfid results can be accomplished by concentrating efforts at one spot. The field is large. There are millions of people yet to be visited and helped in getting a knowledge of the Kingdom. What privilege could be greater? If you wish to spend 150 hours in the field service and devote all your time to the all airs of The Theocracy, write the office for an application blank and details regarding the pioneer work.</span></p>

While there have been no Kingdom publishers living in . . . , it appears that next month's report will show its increase.

<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Name of Campaign for May Is Descriptive of Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Will you aid those of every nation, kindred, people, and tongue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the entire month of May the Society is putting on a special campaign to aid all people of goodwill. Hundreds of thousands of copies of books and booklets have been printed in various languages in years past, not only for this country but for foreign countries. Because of conditions as they now exist in the earth, shipping has ceased to many foreign countries and this literature containing the Kingdom message is on hand. It is Utting at this time that the Kingdom publishers place it in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah, through his Word, says that the people will come from every nation, kindred, and tongue, and he has seen to it that the literature is placed in various languages. It is our great privilege and honor to have a share in this distribution. In the United Slates, at Brooklyn and the depots, there are approximately 3.300,000 books and booklets on hand, in 25 languages, which we should like to distribute free to those persons who will read them. The details of this campaign have been set out in a special order blank entitled “Aiding Refugees”, sent to your company servant, which he should explain to you at the next service meeting. You can then prepare for the May campaign, as far as ascertaining where the people speaking the various languages live. The company servant should in turn see to it that sufficient literature is on hand prior to May 1, so that when you begin calling on these people you will have the literature to give them. It is hoped that by the end of May more than three million pieces of literature will thus be distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Any persons obtaining this literature, whether you give them two, three, or four copies of various books in their language, can contribute what they desire to advance the work, and these contributions can be turned in to the company servant for later turning in to the Society ; but if persons are too poor to contribute and are anxious to learn, let them have some literature free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In working the foreign-language territory week by week you might make quite a number of back-calls. On the first call leave one or tw<sup>T</sup>o booklets, and call back there, and if they have read them, leave them a book. It might be that you can interest the parents in the foreign literature and the children in the English publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Back-calls should be made on these persons. The Society has phonograph records available in many of the languages, and these should be used. Where publishers can speak the language, book studies therein should be arranged. The Lord says, “Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.” (Eccl. 11 : 1) No doubt many of these people will thus learn the truth and become publishers.</span></p>

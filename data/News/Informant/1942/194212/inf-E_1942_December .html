<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Time for New Publishers to Take Stand</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">All who have entered into a covenant with Jehovah God will want to join in singing tiie &quot;victory song”. The privilege is extended to all creatures who love righteousness to do some singing now, and because of their faithful course of action they will finally sing in the victory song after the victory, with all the faithful and true servants of Jehovah. December is the “Victory Song” Testimony Period. It will be a month of praise to the name of the Most High. The servants will march forward fully equipped to aid the people of good-will. Much of this equipment they have recently received—the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Neu; World </span><span class="font1">and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last? </span><span class="font1">These two publications will be tiie principal offer, on a contribution of 25c. in the daily singing. Additionally, tiie Lord has provided his servants with the &quot;sword of the spirit”, a weapon to be used in offensive warfare. Carry this witli you always during the &quot;Victory Song” Testimony Period, so that you will always be in tune with the Lord’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Winter begins in December, but this will not slacken the Lord’s servants nor hinder them in the service. The preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom must be done in all the world for a witness and at all times. If you have not been a regular publisher, December is as good a time to start as any. Do not think to wait until it gets warmer, because you may never get started if you do. To maintain one’s integrity requires one to face some obstacles, bad weather conditions, persecutions, and maybe mob violence ; but, by the Lord's grace, we will do the best to maintain our integrity under all conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Fiscal Year Reveals Excellent Report</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Yearbook</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Carries Details</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The past year has been a most blessed one in service. Those who have shared in the proclamation of Jehovah's name in the United States will rejoice to know that the Lord has added the increase. The average number of publishers during the past year was G2,179, an increase of a little less than 10 percent over 1941, or 5,434 publishers. The publishers accomplished much during the past twelve months. Hours reported witnessing for the Kingdom are 18.240,938. This is an increase of nearly four million hours in the field service over last year. The back-calls made on people of good-will totaled 4.525,982, to compare with the 2,897,810 back-calls made last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The important things to have in mind are: being a publisher, putAll company servants and the assistants in the companies should see to it that the work is well organized for December, and the servants should take tiie lead in the field. Door-to-door witnessing should be arranged in territory convenient for everyone, and have assignments for group witnessing. The back-calls should be made, and studies should be started. Now, with gas rationing on nationwide, the people everywhere will be remaining at home more in their leisure hours, and that gives tiie publishers a splendid opportunity to find the people at their homes and to arrange for back-calls. Do not let inconveniences such as shortage of gas keep you from walking to your back-calls or using some other conveyance. Our privilege is to comfort those that mourn and to give whatever effort is required on our part to carry on the work. This is the advantage of having individual assignments of territory near your homes; however, regardless of the location of your territory, arrange for back-calls and begin studies in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Checkup</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the 15th of the month company servants should check all their publishers' Record Cards to see who lias been out in the service, and those who have not should be assisted to get in some activity before the month ends. Every publisher should be given the opportunity of engaging in the “victory song”. Aid them in every way you can. It is hoped that, by December 1, every company will have received a good supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> Reports show that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> is going faster than any other publication. Let every publisher put his hand to the plow and work and sing during this &quot;Victory Song” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ting time in the field, and making back-calls. These three features of the report show a definite increase over the previous year. There are other' increases too, but these are the important ones to have in mind in our work during the coming year. Books and booklets distributed in the United States were 17.044,959; new subscriptions, 157,748; magazine distribution on street corners and routes, 7.479.710, and sound attendance, 10,010,699. It is a real pleasure to report that during 1942 there was an average of 5,290 pioneers engaging in the service, and that there were, at tiie close of the year, 3.421 companies organized. We thank the Lord for the blessings he has showered upon his servants. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font1"> will bring to you the detailed report of the United States, as well as of the whole world.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>All Have Work to Do</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">January marks the beginning of another year, and, appropriately enough, the Lord through his faithful and wise servant, the Society, holds before the minds of his people a very important issue—Kingdom interests first—and, for our consideration, the words of Jesus, at Matthew 6: 33, are quoted : “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are we seeking first the Kingdom of God? or are we giving other interests priority over the Kingdom interests? This is a serious issue. Outside of the Lord’s organization men are giving priority to everything except the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. If we find upon examination that we are doing likewise, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">then it is time for us to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seeking the Kingdom first means planning for the advancement of the Kingdom interests above and before anything else. This applies to company servants, study conductors and publishers alike, as well as to all full-time publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Servant’s Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">company or unit servant</span><span class="font1"> will take diligent oversight of all the kinds of Kingdom work in the company, and will see to it that these are properly cared for and that he takes the lead in advancing the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">assistant company servant </span><span class="font1">will see to it that all his records are kept up to date; that he carefully checks and analyzes them on the 15th and at the beginning of each month at least, and takes up with the other servants the various features of their work that need particular attention at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">back-call servant</span><span class="font1"> will see that his records are kept up to date; that he has a proper list of all company studies; that he is cooperating fully with study conductors and company publishers in caring for the studies and back-calls ; that he is getting all new ones started in back-call work, and that every effort possible is made to reach regularly those people whose names are on his list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tiie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">territory servant</span><span class="font1"> will see that the company’s assignment of territory is properly subdivided into small individual assignments; that proper provisions are made for territory close to the homes of the publishers ; that territory is provided for each book study and that his records of the assignment of such territory are properly kept, to show which territories are assigned, date they were assigned and the date they were returned, and after each entry indicate (in small, neat figures) the number of times the assignment was covered during the time it was out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">accounts servant</span><span class="font1"> will see that all his accounts are properly kept and reported to the company, and will co-operate fully with the stock and advertising servants in keeping their accounts properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stock servant</span><span class="font1"> will see that the stock is properly cared for, and that the stock room is open at a designated time and proper records are kept of the distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">advertising servant</span><span class="font1"> will see to it that the sound equipment is properly cared for and kept in proper condition, and that magazines are ordered according to the needs of the territory and distributed as outlined by tiie Society. He should have proper records of sound and magazine work. He should encourage all publishers owning phonographs to use the recorded introduction to the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Study-Group Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">study conductor</span><span class="font1"> is obligated to see that his lessons are properly prepared and that the meetings are properly conducted; that he takes a study group out in the back-call work at least one night during the week, and that proper arrangements are made to take out into the field on Saturday and Sunday, and such other opportune time throughout the week as can be arranged, new publishers and all those who do not have individual assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">publishers,</span><span class="font1"> which include all the servants and study conductors, will diligently plan to redeem the time and put every moment possible in the Kingdom service, working their individual assignments, making back-calls, conducting book studies in the homes of the people and co-operating fully in tiie back-call work with their study group. Publishers should arrange to engage in some branch of the magazine activity. Publishers should always cooperate with the servants and never lose sight of the fact that the 60-hour quota is a possibility and the reasonable expectation of each normally well person. If each one will do his part it will mean that he is being “New World minded”, and is a fighter for the New World, putting Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During January each one will have an opportunity to demonstrate that with him the Kingdom interests are really first. We will continue with the offer of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace</span><span class="font1"> booklet, on contribution of twenty-five cents. Let all demonstrate to the Lord and to our brethren, and to all concerned, that we are not as the Gentiles, seeking the tilings of the old world and selfish interests, but that with us it is the Kingdom interests that are first all the time.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>50,000 Studies Our Goal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">All fighters for the New World should be conducting at least one book study each week. To place a book in the hands of a person and then go on and leave him is leaving a job half done. The Lord brings tins matter forcibly to our attention in the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch. The spirit of the Lord commanded Philip to join himself to the eunuch’s chariot and inquire, “Understandest thou what thou readest? . . . How can I, except some man should guide me?” (Acts 8: 30, 31) The Lord has so arranged It that those who love him are given an opportunity to prove their love for him by feeding his “sheep”. To refuse or be negligent in doing this would be the same as for Philip to refuse to join himself to the chariot of the Ethiopian eunuch, and to say, ‘lie has the book of Isaiah ; that is enough, let him read that.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today Jehovah commands his people to join themselves to the people of good-will, those searchers after the truth, such as the Ethiopian eunuch, and to help them by inquiring, “Understandest thou what thou readest?” and see to it that they receive the necessary assistance to understand it. No consecrated servant of Jehovah can now, without serious consequences, disregard this Kingdom requirement. The Lord has provided us with the books </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children, </span><span class="font1">which contain a message of vital importance for the people of goodwill. He has provided us -with a question booklet on each book, so that it is possible to break down and explain every paragraph in the</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Back-Calls Important</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Helpful Suggestions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Just as witnessing from house to house is preaching the gospel according to the Lord's commands, so is the making of back-calls part of one's preaching commission. The former sifts the field to identify the newly aroused “sheep”, the latter makes provision for the feeding and strengthening of that newly found “sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many publishers still plod along in the house-to-house service feeling that their covenant obligations cease with the mere placing of the literature in the hands of the people. Such was the procedure years ago, but alert and New World visioned publishers see that the work has changed to that of more intense feeding and teaching. We hereby put forth a call for all publishers, young and old, remnant and Jona-dab, to henceforth participate more regularly in the back-call feature of the Theocratic service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this time all publishers are using the “House to House Record” form (S-15) to record the thorough covering of their individual territory. On this form will be noted every placement of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font1"> Upon the placement of each book the publisher should mention that when he is in the neighborhood again he would like to drop in to see how they are enjoying the book. Then in two or more weeks make the casual and informal back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ask to step in. Conduct a brief discussion centering around the books and support that presentation with adequate scriptures. He has, additionally, provided us with the new “sword of the spirit”, supplemented with an index of proper names, expressions and their meanings, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> New World Theocratic concordance and “God’s Word on Vital Subjects” ; so that our every need is supplied while conducting a proper and profitable book study. There is no possible excuse for not trying to do as the Lord here commands. We should not only attend a book study regularly, but should conduct one. Remember, the conductor always learns more than those attending, so it’s to your advantage to have a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not conduct two studies each week, one in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and one in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font1"> with the same party. Conduct one study in whichever book he prefers and let him go to the company headquarters for any additional studies. Persons who are that far advanced and interested will be glad to co-operate to this extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is the hope of the Society to have upwards of 50,000 book studies conducted every week throughout the United States in either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> book or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book. Let’s get really study-conscious! Let’s follow up all interest we record on our House to House Record slips (S-15). and always work to the one end. namely, arranging for and conducting studies. People will be home more regularly during this winter. Gas rationing may keep them home; don’t let it keep you home. The prospects were necer better than this vviiuer for organizing studies IVhat will you do toward that 51,000?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font1"> Answer any questions they may have. Show them the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The New World&quot;</span><span class="font1"> 87</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ndy Questions,</span><span class="font1"> with its more than 500 questions. Give them a sample of some of the questions discussed. Then read to them the brief instructions on pages 3 and 4 of the study booklet, which explains the procedure of a home book study. By this time you will be able to approach them as to calling next week at a stated time to start such a private home Bible study with them, and all at no additional cost whatever to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We believe that thousands of successful back-calls can be conducted in this informal manner, leading to thousands of regular book studies being established. Try this suggestion and witness the Lord's blessing upon your efforts. It would also be well to take your phonograph with you on the first back-call and additionally play them one or two short lectures. In this way your first back-call will give an additional witness, make use of your phonograph and also lead to a definite book study. Be kind to and thoughtful of the people and let them see your zeal for the New World. They, in turn, will respond by having confidence in you and desiring you to return to conduct the study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">We rejoice to announce that in the Lord's providence the annual </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> and calendar are now available. The 1043 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font1"> gives thrilling reports from valiant fighters for the New World, scattered throughout the earth. The calendar sets forth the 1943 field campaigns for all Theocratic warriors, as well as a beautiful picture with attention centered on the New World. All lovers of righteousness will delight to possess a copy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font1"> not only that they may share in the Kingdom joys of their brethren throughout the world but also for the daily texts and comments which are so essential in strengthening the Lord's people for their daily warfare.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Only Two Months Away</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">It is apparently </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1"> Lord’s will that February, 194?,, be a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-lower</span><span class="font1"> campaign. We confidently look forward to the biggest year yet in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions, because people are hungering for tlie truth and seeking after righteousness more than ever before. Today, amid a wicked, war-ridden world and slaving under the yoke of cruel murderous dictators in nations that are locked in death with the demons are many people of good-will who are worn weary by the strife, trouble, famines, taxes, restrictions, oppression, etc., that are heaped upon them, and they are now looking for some measure of relief and comfort. The entire old world is rushing madly on to its doom. Those people who have pure hearts and a sincere desire to do right want to separate themselves from the wickedness of this world. How can they do this, and where will they find this relief and comfort? The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font1"> source of truth and life is the spiritual food prepared for them, particularly in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchlower</span><span class="font1"> magazine, which we are obligated to bring to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The added trials and increased tribulations that have been imposed upon the peoples during the past year have caused many to come to their senses and wonder what this whole thing is all about. They are now in a much more meek, humble and receptive attitude than ever before, and should gladly welcome the comforting gospel (good news) of the Kingdom and submit themselves to do the w ill of the Greater Jeph-rhah. Christ Jesus, just as Jeph-thah's daughter willingly and unhesitatingly submitted herself wholly to Jehovah’s service at ills temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name of that campaign in February is the “Jephthah’s Daughter” Testimony I’eriod, and truly it is very significant of the work that will be done at that time— feeding the “Jephthah’s daughter” class or the “other sheep”. As soon</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It has been practically impossible to get any records to fill orders in the past few months. The brethren everywhere should be very careful with the records they have on hand; nevertheless, using them just as much as possible. We have a failsupply of “Children” records (P-261, P-262) on hand. Reports have come in that this record has aided in placing the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World. </span><span class="font1">The publishers run this record and then offer both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> on the 50c contribution. If the person does not desire both books, then he is offered his choice of either one of the books. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">or the latest book. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New Woild. </span><span class="font1">This keeps the phonographs in use, which is essentia], and at the same time presents clearly the message of the Kingdom through the record “Children”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If any new records can be manufactured. the Society will try to have them made. Until that time we feel sure that the brethren everywhere will use all the records available and all the equipment they have and will keep them busy in tlie interests of the Kingdom. Tlie “Children” records can be had at 70c apiece, six for $3.50.</span></p>

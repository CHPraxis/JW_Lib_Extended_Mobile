<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Do Company Publishers Lag in This?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Special Publishers Doing Very Well</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Society requested the companies and pioneers to submit a report of the number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">studies they were conducting the last week in May; also to show tlie attendance at these studies, exclusive of publishers. The situation revealed by these ligures is interesting, and a careful study of them should prove very beneficial to each one who has entered into covenant obligations with the Lord. They revealed—</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. That there are 52,G4G newly interested in attendance at these studies, all of whom are prospective witnesses. These added to our 62,000 publishers would make a grand total of over 114,000, all of whom should be reporting some activity before long.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. That 1,458 special publishers conducted 5,842 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies, or, on the average, 4 studies a week for each special publisher. They are doing well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. That 3,873 general pioneer publishers conducted 5,071 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">studies, or 1.3 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies a week for each general pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. That 5G,614 company publishers conducted 11,591 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies, or .2 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> study for each publisher. In other words, 1 out of every 5 company publishers, on the average, was conducting a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> study each week. In fact, tlie condition is much worse than that, for many zealous company publishers conduct two or more studies; which shows a greater number of publishers who do not conduct any at all.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The question naturally arises. Why is it that general pioneers conduct, on an average, only 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book study? Why is it that, on the average, 80 percent of the company publishers do not conduct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies? It is not necessary to comment in great detail on the foregoing figures. They tell their own story. Each one should carefully study them for himself, and not for the other fellow, and then place himself in whichever category of the above group he finds himself. What is your company average? Have you taken it up with the company? In the final analysis this is a matter between the individual and the Lord. In order to have the Lord’s approval the creature must be faithful. Each one must bear his own burden in this respect. No one can carry the other fellow's burden. Therefore these figures are submitted for the careful and prayerful consideration of each and every one.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You’re Going to Be There, Aren’t You? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Contracts Already Signed for 43 Cities!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Don’t Miss a Day Much Work to Do</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses has been announced for September 18, 19, and 20. It is only by Jehovah’s guidance and direction that an assembly of this kind for this year could be arranged. His blessing has been most manifest in our already having contracts signed in 43 different convention cities. Fifty-three cities have been selected, and in the cities not already having signed contracts arrangements are coming along well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This convention has been arranged so that the name of Jehovah God may be magnified in the earth. It is very apparent from the Scriptures that the Lord’s people will continue to carry on with the proclamation of the Kingdom regardless of what occurs in the world at this time. The Devil, through his powerful organization, would stop the onward march of the Kingdom, but this he cannot do. In many parts of the earth the work has apparently been stopped by totalitarian decree, by war, by persecution, . . . but as long as Jehovah’s servants have breath and can speak of Jehovah’s salvation and His purposes, this they will do and are doing. In many countries of the world Jehovah’s servants are still able to assemble together, and therefore assemblies have been arranged not only in the United States, but in England, Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, and other places. The same dates have been selected and the same program is being arranged wherever possible. It will be a glorious occasion and a mighty shout will go upward unto the Lord in heaven, praising his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much Work To Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in connection with these conventions; therefore everyone should arrange to spend the full three days at the convention. It is only’ a short period of time, and in order to inform the people in these convention cities relative to the assembly it will take the united efforts of every individual attending the convention. We strongly recommend that all publishers of the Kingdom be at the convention city Friday morning ready for field service and enjoy all the blessings of the convention Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Much advertising will have to be done relative to the public meeting, which will be addressed by the president of the Society, the subject being “PEACE —Can It Last?” This subject will arouse the interest of many persons throughout the world because peace is being so widely discussed at the present time and they want to know what will be the outcome. The Scriptural answer will be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s work requires haste, and there is so much to do at the present time; therefore our every attention during these three days should be devoted wholly to the Theocratic Assembly. Everyone should get out of this assembly all that the Lord provides, so that when they return to their homes they can go to work with greater zeal and determination during the coming year than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">People of Good-will</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A year ago the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> was released, and information was given out at that convention concerning the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course, and since then there has been organization of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies in the homes. Thousands of these have since been arranged from coast to coast. Many of these persons have by now studied sufficiently to know that this is the truth. It is the duty of the Lord’s people to make arrangements for these people of good-will to attend the Theocratic Assembly if they so desire; therefore the Society, by endeavoring to prepare so many conventions, for convenience to the various parts of the United States, has made it possible for all to attend. During the next month every company servant should see that the brethren are given opportunity to call on these people of good-will, invite them to tlie convention, see what arrangements can be made to get them there, show them the importance of attending this assembly, and, if they cannot get there for all three days, urge them to be there for at least Saturday and Sunday. If all three days can be arranged, this will be to their blessing. Those who have made a covenant with the Lord will see to it, by the Lord's grace, that these three days of the year are set aside wholly for the praising of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make your arrangements now and, if you possibly can, aid others to get to the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1942. All cars coming to the assembly should be fully occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord ; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>School Children</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">All brethren who have children excluded from school and which children are of compulsory school age should return the children to school at the current term; and if the children are again excluded, then proceed to file with the school board the customary petition for reinstatement, which will be furnished by the Society upon request.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Attention, Company Servants and Treasurers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">It is the duty of both the company servant and the treasurer to see that any checks sent to the Society are made out properly, so that they can be cashed without any difficulty. Any mistakes made in this regard result in a considerable loss of time and money that belong to the Lord. Please carefully note the following points in regard to making out checks:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. Be certain that you have sufficient funds in your account to cover afty checks you write.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Do not remit a check with an alteration or an erasure. You will save yourself and others both time and money by destroying it and writing a new one immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Make certain you have written the correct date, the correct amount in both places, the title of the account where necessary, and both signatures where two are needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Personal Witnessing</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Work Must Go On</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">During the month of September we shall continue presenting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 25c. The Society’s Calendar calls our attention to the fact that this is ‘personal witnessing month’, and submits for our consideration Acts 8: 4—“Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.” This forcibly focuses our attention on the fact that even though the Lord’s people may be persecuted and scattered abroad and may encounter many other features of opposition from the enemy, none of these will be accepted as an excuse for not preaching the Word. Our brethren in other lands have given us a wonderful example in this respect Despite war, persecution and prison they continue to speak the Word, their zeal and devotion for the Lord and The Theocracy putting many in this favored land to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Read again “Defeat of Persecution”, in the July 15 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font1">Consider the message it contains and then go forward in the strength of the Lord and make September, the last month of this fiscal year, the greatest month for number of publishers in the field and hours devoted to the service. Let us strive for a new peak in publishers. In September 1941 the last peak of company publishers was attained. The pioneers have been doing their part throughout 1942, practically every month attaining a new peak. The company publishers have shown no increase. Why? The answer may be found in the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Children </span><span class="font1">Studies”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Will a New Peak of Publishers Be Reached?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">During August, Jehovah's witnesses throughout the U. S. have the privilege of participating in tlie “Comfort” Testimony Period. Truly a really comforting message for all people of good-will is contained in the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hope—</span><span class="font1">For the living—For tlie Survivors—In a Righteous World. A great weight or burden is laid upon tlie testimony-bearers of Jehovah and it is tlieir privilege and bounden duty to take the comforting message contained in these publications to all the people in their territory who have a hearing ear and have a desire to learn tlie real cause of the present woe upon the world and tlie only cure for the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The servants of the Lord have themselves been abundantly provided with the comforting message, and it cannot lie in their hands and gather dust, hut must be ‘'circulated” and get where it will do some good. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This his witnesses must do. </span><span class="font1">There is where the general company publishers, general pioneers and special pioneers come in. Each one has an individual territory and is to look after it in accordance with instructions. Are you doing your part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What Are the Children Doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What about you children who attended the St. Louis assembly last year? Are you performing your covenant obligations? Remember, some 15,000 of you agreed before the Lord and that vast audience to witness during the summer vacation and at all times to your friends and others who would hear, telling them the news of The Theocracy. Are you children doing that now? School is out and there is really no reason for not getting in lots of time during the summer vacation months. Remember what Brother Rutherford said: that each one should strive to put in at least six hours a day in the service during summer vacation. If the children are not fully carrying out their covenant obligations and are not taking advantage of all opportunities to honor the name of the Lord, can it be said that it is entirely their fault? Are the parents taking advantage of every opportunity that presents itself to aid their children to see their privilege of spending much time in the field? Are the parents setting a proper example for their children? Are you parents planning to bring your children to the 1942 Theocratic Assembly? These and other related questions should be prayerfully considered by all concerned, and each one should arrive at whatever decision he believes is proper and pleasing to tlie Lord and then let nothing stop him from following the proper course. These things are called to the attention of the brethren to refresh them of their obligations and responsibilities and their privilege of serving the Lord; and if each one diligently strives to perform his assigned part, then a new peak in publishers and hours will certainly be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">80,000 Publishers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The company publishers have not set a new peak this year. To date, the highest peak of company publishers was established in September, 1941, to wit, GO,094 publishers. This should be far surpassed during August. If everyone associated— new publishers learning the truth at hook studies, the general company publishers, old and young, and all the pioneers—if all these get out during August we can be assured of the Lord's rich blessing and a new peak being reached. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liemember that “80,000 publishers” mark.</span><span class="font1"> Get your ‘‘Children” record (T-262) (still plenty on hand at Brooklyn). Get your phonograph oiled up. Stock up on literature needed for the month and start the ball rolling early in the morning of August 1. Remember evening work. Arrange to give those associated with your book studies the opportunity to “comfort” others in the Testimony Period. Tell them to be ready to work about one hour before time for the study to begin. Give them tlieir own individual .territory, show them how to work it, and leave it in the Lord’s hands to direct and bless tlieir efforts. Make tills a regular thing. Really put on tlie heat, full steam ahead, and don't let slip any opportunity to participate and help others participate in any phase of tlie Theocratic work. Everyone “bear his own burden” and be “blameless in the day of our. Lord”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Assignments a Big Job</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Have Your Requests In Before September 1</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Along with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> there is sent a Room Assignment form. The company servants are requested to hand one of these forms to each family in the company that is going to the convention. Provide forms to persons of good-will who also plan on attending tlie convention. If there are some (and we hope there will be very few) persons who cannot attend the convention it will not be necessary for them to have tlie enclosed form. If you do not have sufficient forms for your company, then reasonably accurate copies of these forms may be written out locally, so that the proper information is conveyed to the convention committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The convention assembly this year has been so arranged that tlie brethren will not have to travel great distances. It is suggested that the brethren select the city nearest to their homes and attend that convention. Have in mind that the program at all the convention cities will be identical. The lectures that are given at tlie key city, Cleveland. Ohio, will all be given at the various convention cities by brethren appointed to deliver those lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For your convenience there are set out below the convention cities that the Society has selected, showing tlie rooming committee addresses. In a few instances we have no convention committee address because contracts have not yet been signed for auditoriums or proper information has not been received from the convention servants. Brethren living near these cities will please wait until the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">or the September 1 issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> announces the rooming committee addresses. If for some reason a contract cannot be closed in these cities, then the brethren will select the city next nearest to them and attend that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All other publishers should now select their nearest convention city, fill out the Room Assignment forms for their parties, and send them to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tlie comparison of June figures below shows a very consistent increase on the part of tlie pioneers, but the company publishers and tlieir activity do not show up so well. In fact, Ilie company publishers' activity shows a decided drop when compared witli June 1941, and in that year many of the brethren at distant points were making intensive preparations for the St. Louis convention and duties incidental thereto. Despite this they reported GO,055 company publishers in the field, averaging 17 hours. This year, with none of the above-mentioned interruptions to hamper the work, we had only 57,602 company publishers reporting, averaging only 15.8 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A serious question arises: Why such a slump this year? From all reports coming to the otlice there were a great many people of good-will immersed during 1942 and there is every indication that a very large percentage of these are participating in tlie field service. There are a great many children who are participating in all branches of the service, particularly street magazine work, who were not so engaged last year. In view of this, why is there not an increase in number of publishers? Tlie facts seem to be that there are thousands of persons who were actively engaged in the service last year who are not engaged in the service now. What is the cause of this? Have this great number lost faith in the Kingdom? Are they willing, like Esau, to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage? Has the fear of man or the enemy organization laid hold upon them? There must be some tangible reason for this condition, and whatever the reason is it cannot be a Scriptural one, for the Lord says, “When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him,” and tells us how this would be done, by commanding his people, “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; . . . lift up a standard for the people.” Instead of the Kingdom activity’s diminishing, then, particularly in the case of the older brethren, it should be increased; for these are obligated before the Lord to “raise up the standard for the people” in this crucial hour. These facts and figures are worthy of the careful and prayerful consideration of each one of the Lord’s people.</span></p>

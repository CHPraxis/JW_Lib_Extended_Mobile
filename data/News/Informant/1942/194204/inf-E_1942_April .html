<p><span class="font2">“Children of The King” has to the Lord's people deep significance and. while applying to adults as well as youngsters, when these words are mentioned it always recalls to mind that wonderful assembly of God’s people at St. Louis, and the release of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2">book before a visible audience of 15,000 children between the ages of 5 and 18. On August 10, 1941, 15,000 children shouted in unison that they would go forth with the new instrument provided by the Lord. Many of these children have kept that covenant with the Lord by spending much time in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Children serving The King are again offered a splendid opportunity during the “Children of The King” Testimony Period, in April, and the faithful parents will aid their children to see their wonderful privilege of magnifying the name of the Lord and engaging in the service work during this month, and at all times. All publishers of the Kingdom should put forth real effort to engage in the service in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The April Testimony Period brings with it more daylight hours. With several of these daylight hours after supper the publishers can spend many evenings with their children in making back-calls, going from door to door, working in the rural sections, and covering small villages. Publishers can distribute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font2"> in their individual territories between back-calls in the evenings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> study groups can spend a half hour or so in near-by territory with the new booklet before the meeting. Children and new publishers will enjoy this. Interest found can be noted, and calls made later with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Going over Your Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the publishers who have constantly followed the directions of the Society in getting an individual territory and covering it thoroughly once, twice, three times, will now want to go over it the fourth time with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font2"> as a new instrument in their hands. All of the children of The King will want </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> present </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font2"> having in mind, too, offering </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> as well. Cover your entire territory again, trying to get new subscribers, and while you are doing this see that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope </span><span class="font2">is placed in every home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arrange for more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies, back-calls and model studies. Increase the attendance at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies you have already organized. The release of the new question booklet on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> is announced in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> This will be an added stimulus for those who are now attending your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies to prepare their lessons and to come regularly to the meetings. With this new instrument even children and the most inexperienced publishers will have no difficulty in conducting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At your back-calls where individuals have not yet made the effort to come to your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies in your territory, why not read to them, out of your question booklet on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> half a dozen questions that will be answered at the next study of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children?</span><span class="font2"> Do not give them the answer, but let them come and hear. Arouse their interest. Those who love righteousness hope for better conditions. They must take a stand for the Lord and put forth an effort.

<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Aid to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Study Conductors</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Knowing the need for a question booklet on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> publication, the Society has prepared a series of questions on the entire book and has now printed it in a 64-page booklet entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Children</span><span class="font2"> Study Questions”. This booklet is now ready, and should be used by all publishers conducting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The introduction to this booklet, entitled “Profitable Study”, should be read at the first meeting of all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies, so that those attending may be acquainted as to how the study will be conducted. The primary point to have in mind is that the study should be an hour in length; and while the introduction says an effort should be made to study ten pages, this is the approximate portion to be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to properly study the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> all scriptures cited but not quoted in the paragraphs studied should be looked up, and read at the proper time. In the question booklet on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> at the end of each question there are scriptures cited, one or more, which also are to be looked up and read. The toward their privilege of praising the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Peak of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again upward of 60,000 publishers were in the field in February. But our peak for 1942 was set at 80,000 publishers. We have quite a way to go. By the beginning of April the new work of organizing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies and the new work of the special publisher (pioneer) will have been in operation for four months. Good results should be seen in April, during the “Children of The King” Testimony Period. There seems to be every reason why a new peak of publishers should be reached in April. Undoubtedly thousands will have come to the Memorial of the Lord’s death and will have been invited to engage in the field service. All those who have ever been in the field before will want to get out in April. The 15,000 children, and many more who have recently learned of the truth, will want to do their share. The weather is in our favor. The instruments are in our hands, and the time is here to proclaim the message. Let us one and all share in this great work of proclaiming the King and his Kingdom and rejoice that we are children of The King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">study will show the people that Jehovah’s witnesses are students of the Bible and their aim is that the mind of the person should always be directed to the Bible for the proper answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The suggestion is offered that, before the meeting opens, the study conductor write on small slips of paper the various scriptures to be looked up, and give them to different individuals at the meeting; and when the time comes to read these scriptures they will have been looked up and marked with the slip of paper at the right place, ready for reading; thus saving time and giving everybody in the study something to do in addition to answering the questions. If the brethren hold to the routine set out in the introduction of this booklet it will be helpful not only to the conductor but to those attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet is offered at five cents a copy, and it would be well to place this question booklet with as many attendants at the studies as want it, so that they can prepare their lessons in advance. This booklet will save much time on the part of the brethren because of their thus not having to prepare questions, and especially the time of the special</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Phonographs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is shipping regularly the vertical-type phonographs that have been completed, to those persons having their orders with the Society. We cannot accept any new orders. If brethren desire to get phonographs locally and cancel their orders for a vertical-type, we will cancel your order, and will ship to you such literature as you request for the money you have paid for the phonograph or will return to you your deposit. Even though orders are canceled, no new orders will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no objection to brethren getting good phonographs </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font2"> any local store if they can still be obtained, and using them in the field service. We also urge that wherever possible brethren make their own repairs and try to get the parts locally. Many standard parts we are no longer able </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to get,</span><span class="font2"> such as needle cups, lid braces, hinges, various types of screws, and you can just as well get these locally from some hardware company as to order from the Society. Many things we were able to obtain in New York we can no longer get, but by searching around you may be able to get some supplies in other cities; but these are dwindling rapidly. Your co-operation will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To those who have ordered vertical-type phonographs, we say it may be many months before we fill your order. Please do not write the Society for the shipping date, but be assured that they will be shipped as soon as completed, and according to date your order was received.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Claims for Damages</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">When brethren receive literature or records in a damaged condition, please have the postmaster or the freight agent note the damage in writing. Do not give or show to the postmaster or railroad agent any invoices, but state that the claim for damage will be made by the Watchtower at Brooklyn. Then mail to the Society a letter describing the damage, enclosing an acknowledgment of damage by the carrier employed, as well as your original invoice. We will start the claim here and make collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society always replaces records and books immediately on such claims, and will not make additional charge, but we must have the proper papers to make claim. The Society prefers to make all the claims rather than having the local.brethren make them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">publishers (pioneers) who are conducting numerous studies each week. Knowing “the heart of the righteous studieth to answer” (Prov. 15:28), this booklet is published. It will also be a great aid to the servants of The Theocracy in their field activity, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Month of May Devoted to Foreign-speaking People </span><span class="font2">The Society has on hand and is now shipping according to order thousands upon thousands of pieces of literature containing the Kingdom message printed in foreign tongues. During the month of May all of the time will be devoted to aiding ‘refugees’. The foreign-language literature that the company servants and the pioneers have ordered for their territory will be placed with those persons speaking foreign tongues. They will be offered not only one or two or three pieces of literature, but as much as they will read. The publishers will tell them they may make a contribution towards the work, but if they cannot do this the literature will be left with them just the same if they will read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not be stingy with the literature in foreign languages, but give them the opportunity to study. Try to make back-calls later and see how they are getting on. Where one or more persons in the family speak English, leave the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font2"> booklet in the combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Still a Good Supply</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Are You Meeting Jehovah’s Requirements?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The special publisher activity continues to show the same splendid results mentioned in the March </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> During the month of February the special publishers averaged 170 hours despite the intense winter weather and the very violent opposition they encountered in some sections of the country. Their average number of back-calls for the first three months follows: December, 47; January, 63}; February, 64}. This shows a real effort on the part of these brethren to advance the Kingdom interests, and as a result the Lord has blessed their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During February they conducted weekly 4,883 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies, averaging 5 studies per publisher. The weekly attendance was 11,566. The number of requests for company organizations coming from the special publishers is increasing daily, and, undoubtedly, by the time the first six months are completed we shall have a good group of new active companies completely organized. This is clear evidence of the Lord’s blessing upon the special publisher activity. This is also a clear indication from the Lord regarding what features of the work should be pushed vigorously now. Consequently Brother Knorr has authorized the following announcement in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Any general pioneer publisher who has been on the list since January 1, 1942, and who feels that he or she can meet the special publisher requirements of 175 hours and 50 back-calls a month, using the phonograph consistently and organizing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies, and is willing to accept an assignment of territory anywhere the Society may desire to use him or her, may make application, to the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.Y., for neers can use more of these they should send in their order and we will see what we can do in filling the order with additional supplies for distribution during the “Aiding Refugees” campaign. Use jour regular order blanks and mark on them “FREE LITERATURE”, behind the quantity and language of the books and booklets you request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All companies and pioneers should by now have thoroughly surveyed their territory and know what nationalities live in various districts, and should be prepared to deliver to them such literature as they are furnished. Every publisher of the Kingdom should do what he can to aid these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If perchance there are no foreignspeaking people in your territory, then you should continue with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign special offer for the month of May. Have in mind, however, that aiding the “refugees” is the important thing and that they need to be hunted out and told of the Kingdom just as much as others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The testimony booklet containing the testimony in many languages may prove profitable during this month. Recordings in foreign languages will also aid. In your work show kindness towards these people and give them every possible assistance to seek the right course to follow. Make May an unusual month in caring for the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">special publisher pioneer service. It is understood, however, that brethren who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for the allowance provided for special publishers even though they maj be on the list of special publishers. The selection of special publishers is entirely at the Society’s discretion. It is hoped we can greatly increase appointments to this special mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Pioneers Required</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is now clearly to be seen that The Theockacy offers the only secure haven for people of good-will. This haven is open to all who have ‘fled to the mountains’ and there maintained their Integrity before the Lord. All such must be blameless in the day of the Lord. Any who could be expending all their time in the Lord’s service should be doing so. This is called to each one's attention now that they may carefully and prayerfully consider the matter and see if some arrangements can be made whereby they may devote their entire time in the pioneer service. It is not necessary to have an automobile and trailer before you can be a pioneer. Many pioneers are now working in cities and small towns on foot and enjojing a rich blessing. Ask yourself, Am I wholly for The Theockacy? If so, why am I not in the full-time service now? Consider your obligations to the Lord by virtue of your covenant of consecration ; then consider all other obligations that you may have. I’ut them side by side and then prayerfully consider the matter before the Lord. Bare your heart before Him, and there, before the Lord, make your decision. This decision is entirely between yourself and the Lord. This Is a burden no one else can carry for you; consequently you must bear It yourself. Therefore all should seriously consider their responsibility before the Lord, and face the facts.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>When Will the Increase Come?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All company publishers should take note of the steady increase in the results of the pioneer work. During February 1941 the pioneers averaged 99.1 hours and 21.7 back-calls. One year later, February 1942, they averaged 122.5 hours and 36.9 back-calls. This is a wonderful increase and shows that an effort was put forth on their part, and the Lord's blessing for their faithful devotion to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now compare the results of the general company publishers for the same months. During February 1941 the company publishers averaged 12.9 hours and 3.2 back-calls. One year later, February 1942, they averaged 12.6 hours and 3.6 back-calls</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>June Has Special Offer to the People</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Many companies are well supplied with a very large stock of booklets. It is good, while we have opportunity. to get these into the hands of the people through a special offer during the mouth </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of June.</span><span class="font2"> The willing volunteers of The Theockacy should all engage in this campaign and offer to the people the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and seven booklets, on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If persons already have the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> then offer to them their choice of seven booklets on a contribution of 10c. In making up these combinations of seven booklets to be offered on a ten-cent contribution, four should be self-covered and three be colored-cover booklets, either in the English or in foreign languages. The colored-cover booklets will be offered to the company publishers at lie each during this month only; and the Society will credit the company book accounts 2c for each colored-cover booklet so placed, if request be made on the June Report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special wrappers will be provided by the Society for the seven booklets. Evening work will be stressed in addition to intensive back-call service. All companies and pioneers should prepare for this campaign by ordering self-covered and colored-cover booklets the Society has on hand or use your own stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Brethren should not order celluloid envelopes for testimony cards at the present time. We are unable to supply them. The orders we have on hand we will endeavor to fill whenever we can. If we are unable to do so, a credit memo will be issued to adjust your account. This will apply also to any other material that is permanently out of stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cash items are those items that cannot be charged to any account. A remittance to cover must accompany all such orders. Cash items are as follows: Bibles, Bible dictionaries and concordances, yearbooks, calendars, model study booklets, question booklets, Jehovah’s Servants Defended, Advice for Kingdom Publishers, catalogues, testimony booklets, bookmarks, folders, Kingdom News, service forms for company use, phonograph and transcription needles, phonograph parts, musical records and foreign language records.</span></p>

The campaign literature of the Society, both books and booklets, may be charged to the company’s or pioneer’s account when the account is in good condition. These are not considered cash items. Pioneers should not order company service forms except when a pioneer is acting as company servant. Where company forms are required they should be obtained from the local company organization.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Only Three Days, but Busy Ones</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Enthusiasm runs high from coast to coast. Jehovah's witnesses everywhere are talking, planning to go, and going to the New World Theocratic Assembly. Which assembly will you attend?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Cleveland, Key City</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magnificent, spacious Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio, will be the hub of the national convention. From this assembly point, which we hope will be packed out by Jehovah's witnesses, will be sent forth by direct wire to all the other convention cities in the United States the address of welcome at 8 o’clock (Eastern time) Friday evening, September 18, as well as the keynote speech of this New World Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again all convention cities will be tied in on Saturday afternoon, the 19th, at which time all will be privileged to hear the lecture “Fighters for the New World&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday afternoon, 4 o'clock Eastern time, the public address, which is being widely advertised, on the subject “Peace—Can It Last?” will be sent to all convention cities by direct-wire communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Letters have been coming in to the Society asking whether it would be proper to attend the key city assembly at Cleveland even though another convention city may be | nearer. It would be. In fact, it is hoped that every large company throughout the United States, and small companies if possible, will have some of their local brethren at the Cleveland convention. There are undoubtedly a number of brethren who can afford to make the trip to Cleveland. Therefore it is expected that brethren from every state in the Union will be there. Every person fully devoted to the Kingdom will put forth every effort to get to one of the 53 conventions in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main arena in the Cleveland Public Auditorium seats upward of 12,000, and there is another auditorium seating 3,000 that can be opened up on the other side of the stage. In other words, the speaker’s platform will be in the middle of the two auditoriums, together seating 15,000. Other halls and large exhibit rooms will be thrown open if the crowd gets larger. Everything will be connected by loudspeaker equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be There from the Start</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a short convention, only </span><span class="font5">three days, but it will be a busy one </span><span class="font4">published in “Assembly for Worship”, which will aid the rooming committee in making assignments. Don’t wait until the last day or two to write for rooms, but do it now.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">for every one of the Lord’s servants. No matter where you work or what you are doing, each one planning to atlend the convention should, if j at all possible, be there the full time, beginning 8:30 a.m. Friday, September 18. Start out in the field service and share in the blessed privilege of proclaiming the Kingdom message and inviting the people of the convention city to attend this meeting of Christian people. By the Lord's grace this will be the busiest convention we have ever had, and it is hoped that every publisher and person of good-will will carry his share of the burden to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Invite the New Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine, in its announcement concerning the New World Theocratic Assembly, is inviting all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> readers and their friends to attend these assemblies. You as publishers for The Theocracy should invite all persons whom you know in your territory’ to attend this convention. Do not try to decide in your own mind who you think would want to go and who would not. Tell everyone, the children and the parents, the maidens and the men. Let it be known from one end of the country to the other that this Christian assembly is for their comfort and aid and that Jehovah’s witnesses welcome them to be there. Something of importance has always occurred at past conventions of Jehovah's witnesses, and undoubtedly Jehovah has in store a rich blessing for Uis people at this New World Theocratic Assembly. Let everyone show his faith in Jehovah’s Theocratic arrangement by coming personally and bringing with him his family and everyone of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never before has it been possible for the Lord's people to arrange for assemblies in 53 cities from coast to coast. Jehovah’s blessing is manifestly upon the arrangements; for through much effort and hard work on the part of local companies this has been accomplished. There is every reason why you should attend this assembly. Be prepared to work, and make this the busiest three days in your life in the interests of the New World under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Write for Your Rooms?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All persons attending the Theocratic Assembly should be sure to write to the convention committee in the city vhere they are planning to attend and arrange for their </span><span class="font5">rooms in advance. Use the blank</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Witnessing Month</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Last Chance This Fiscal Year!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Is everybody ready? During September, the month of the 1942 Theocratic Assembly, each consecrated servant of the Lord is obligated and each person of good-will has the privilege of doing some “personal witnessing” by personally taking the Lord’s Word to others in the form of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font4">and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font4"> which are to be offered together on a contribution of 25c. This is a continuation of the offer for the “Comfort” Testimony Period during August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very title of the work for the month, “Personal Witnessing,” signifies that it is each one’s own personal privilege and responsibility to take care of his own individual territory assignment by carefully and orderly witnessing to the same with tlie provided equipment furnished by the Lord. It is the burden of each consecrated servant, whether he is active or has been inactive in tlie service, to get out and aid others to come to a knowledge of the truth. This opportunity to freely tell others of The Theocracy is the portion of the Lord’s servants in this land now, and each one has the privilege of grasping this opportunity before the ‘scattering’ takes place. In the countries overridden by the totalitarian monstros</span><span class="font5">ity, the privilege of openly bearing </span><span class="font4">aloft the standard of The Theocracy is not afforded the Lord’s servants, but, regardless of the opposition of the enemy, they march ahead undaunted. How much more are the publishers of The Theocracy here obligated because of their great amount of liberty and opportunity to do their commissioned work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During September the Kingdom publishers have much in their favor. The weather will, no doubt, be favorable. Opportunities for calling back on those persons previously called on with tlie booklet offer of June and July give good prospects for back-calls and studies. Those attending studies already in operation should be encouraged to attend the coming Theocratic Assembly and should be encouraged and aided to become publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The September work must start with a “bang” and continue on through the month with much zeal and energy expended that a new peak may be reached. This offer should be pushed right up until the convention opens; and then, after the convention is over, several days will be afforded to do additional work in the month of “personal witnessing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do YOUR PART.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>When Will the Company Publishers Increase?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In the August </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> under the title “Are You One Who Has Slacked the Hand?” an analysis was made of the company activity, based on the report for the month of June. The July report, now complete, reveals the same conditions. The pioneers are increasing in number and hours and in corresponding privileges of service, while the company publishers as a whole seem to be slipping backward. Of course, the greater number of individual company publishers are putting forth a real effort and are experiencing the rich blessings of the Lord; but some of the company publishers are not doing so well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This calls to mind the words of Je&lt;us at Matthew 13:12, “For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.” The analysis reveals that there are 50,909 company publishers (3,185 behind last year’s peak of company publishers) and 5,600 pioneers. Nearly 10 percent of all the publishers in July were pioneers. These (10 percent) put in 4G percent of the total witnessing time, made 54 percent of all the back-calls, and placed 53 percent of all tlie bound books and 47 percent of the booklets. This is for the serious consideration of each one of the Lord's people, especially those who have slacked the hand.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising Has Been Our Work Since 1922</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Year Begins</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>How Will It Compare with the Last One?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">October is shown on our Calendar for 1942 as “The Wise’’ Testimony Period. The wise are those who have the mind of the Lord, therefore wisdom. By October 1 the brethren everywhere will have returned home after enjoying tlie refreshment and blessings of another Theocratic assembly. The Lord will have spread his table in the midst of and in spite of ills enemies. lie will have showered his blessings upon his people despite priorities, gas and rubber' restrictions, and any other limitations. The wise the Lord will greatly strengthen and will create in them a burning desire to show their gratitude to Jehovah. “The Wise&quot; Testimony Period, the month of October, provides the very opportunity we want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let every Theocratic publisher who has made a covenant with the Lord joyfully join in this campaign and show he is really wise. During the month of October we shall continue to use the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font4"> and place them on a contribution of 25c. All companies should see to it that they have an adequate supply of literature for this campaign and make very complete arrangements so that everyone in the company will have some part in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">October should witness a new peak in company publishers and in pioneers, a new peak in hours and in back-calls. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fear lest we come short of the Lord's requirements in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again the apostle mentions that we should ‘work out our own salvation with fear and trembling’, which clearly indicates that this matter of serving the Lord should receive our very serious consideration. Therefore let us one and all prepare now to start the new fiscal year of 1943 with a bang that will give the totalitarians a headache.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Co-operation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">It will greatly aid the Society and relieve us of considerable needless correspondence if the brethren will realize that the Society is unable to do anything to assist them in things pertaining to loss of jobs because of their Christian belief. Therefore such correspondence should be discontinued so far as the Society’s office is concerned. Any complaint of this nature should be sent to the National Labor Relations Board at Washington, I). (?., and to the President's Committee on Fair Employment Practice, Social Security Building, Washington, D. C., or to the local state representative of these oilices. Make a typewritten statement of your case and send it by mail to these different organizations, according to the circumstances, requesting that action be taken against your employer. We understand it is not necessary to have such statements notarized.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>When to Start a Model Study</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Brooklyn office has received many letters from the brethren wanting to know when to start a model study with people who manifest some interest in the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, that of first importance is the establishment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font4">studies by the publishers. However, in some cases, the people are not far enough advanced 1o have the publisher start a book study with them, feeling they would be obligated in some way, and they wish to know more about the work of the Lord's Theocratic servants. Here an excellent opportunity is afforded to use the phonograph, play one or more of the recorded convention lectures and start a model study, taking up a subject in which the, person of good-will manifests some interest. Perhaps they are interested in past subjects, which bear also on the present world conditions, such as “Face the Facts&quot;. &quot;Fascism or Freedom,” etc. After the model study has been conducted in the chosen subject and the interest quickened to a degree that a book I study can be started, then shift to the book study. In this way the brethren will find another avenue open to start studies which opens up the way for more time in the service, use of the phonograph, and, by the Lord's grace, the bringing in of more of the Lord's “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Try it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Write Letters Right</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren will greatly aid the Society and help in the prompt and speedy handling of correspondence by always putting their name and address at the upper right-hand corner of each letter.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Doorstep Setup</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Are your placements and opportunities to bear witness few, and your sound attendance low? If so, then probably you are not using the doorstep setup. Brethren who are consistently using the doorstep method of presenting the recorded testimony to The Theocracy report much better all-round results in the field. Why? Because it is an efficient method, as no time is wasted. Also, the usual existing prejudice in the minds of the people toward any person coming to their door with a case is lost when they immediately see and hear what the person is there for. ‘The opportunity to say 'Not interested’ is not afforded, because after a polite 'Good morning' the record is already going. All brethren who have ; phonographs, whether the old t.tpe or the new vertical type, should use the doorstep setup. Start immediately. and realize the Lord's rich blessing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Shipments Are Prepaid</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">All shipments of literattire sent out by the Society to the publishers an* made on the prepaid basis. The freight charges are paiil in advance. In no instances should there be collect charges on shipments from the Society or from the Society's depols. The bill of lading sent to the publishers is a prepaid bill of lading, and if freight charges on shipments come collect the shipment should ' be refused and the Society’s office at 117 Adams St.. Brooklyn, N. Y., notified immediately.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Think</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The following quotation is from a letter recently received in this office: &quot;It is observed that some few of the friends are careless with the printed message and the Kingdom equipment. Cars are seen with literature stacked in the baggage compartment and trunk and much of it unfit for distribution. Trunks in particular have been seen with a great quantity of books, booklets, and magazines absolutely ruined. It seems to be a shame that after our brethren have worked so hard to prepare the message for us anyone would he so careless as to let the I literature get in such a condition.”</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Be an Advertiser?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is not another class of people under the sun who can advertise as effectively as Jehovah’s witnesses do. The Lord’s spirit is upon his servants and they energetically carry forward the public proclamation in the interests of the Lord's work with endurance and zeal that is beyond the understanding of the world. The coming New World Theocratic Assembly offers another wonderful opportunity for us to let all know that the Lord continues to provide many good things for his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Locally you should advertise by telling all those on your list of persons of good-will of the coming assembly. Show them the notice in the September 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wafehtoircr</span><span class="font4"> or No. 600 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Connotation,</span><span class="font4"> and urge them to attend. If you can help them in making arrangements to attend, sending for room assignment, etc., be sure to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The big advertising job will be at the assembly itself. Handbills, placards and signs have been provided for all conventions. Many assemblies are preparing additional advertising material. All of this equipment should be in use at all possible times during the assembly. Officials in some cities, members of the chamber of commerce, newspapermen, and others, have scoffed at this assembly and say there will be only a very small number in attendance, even at the key city of Cleveland. They said the same tiling at St. Louis, and we know what happened there. By the Lord’s grace, let's all accept this challenge and put on the greatest advertising demonstration ever witnessed. Here is the list </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> assembly places. Let’s get busy and advertise.</span></p>

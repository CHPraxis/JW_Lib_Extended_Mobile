<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Use the Special Wrappers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">People of good-will who do not have a knowledge of the Lord’s purposes are perplexed ; in fact, everyone is perplexed and none know what the ultimate outcome will he. The Lord's people have the sure word of prophecy, and the truths that have been brought to our attention in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">show us the work that we have to do. July is the &quot;Let them bead” month, and, by the Lord's grace, every publisher of the Kingdom will have the opportunity of assisting the people of good-will and &quot;let them bead”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special offers that have been presented by the Society during May and June will both he available in the month of July. The primary offer will be the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and seven booklets, on a contribution of 35c. The other work will be the distribution of foreign-language literature in territory that you have not been able to cover up to the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publishers in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no better time than July to get new publishers into the field with the above-named offers; one, giving the literature in the various foreign languages to the people to read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(anyone</span><span class="font2"> can surely do this) ; the other, the special offer of seven booklets on a contribution of only ten cents, which is something that can very easily be presented l&gt;y a new publisher to those on whom he calls from door to door. This offer could be made even in the magazine work, street-corner witnessing—offering the seven booklets on' a contribution of a dime. To those persons with whom you have been having studies and on whom you have been making back-calls for months, and to those people who are attending your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies, point out the privilege that is set before them during these days of peril. In July everyone who professes to be in the truth, anointed or Jonadabs, should put forth a special effort to let them bead, that is, the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the United States, the days in July are about as long as of any month in the year, and it is during that month that good evening work can be arranged. It being light until a late hour, one will find many persons sitting outside, on the doorsteps, and one can talk to them in groups. One will find persons at home in evenings whom one will never find at home on Saturday and Sunday, when the general publishers do most of their work. Take this opportunity to meet these people in territory near your home while it is yet day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Clean-up” Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is considerable literature on the shelves of the companies, and we suggest that all odds and ends be disposed of, such as the older booklets and the foreign literature and any excess literature that the brethren may have in their homes. No good can be accomplished by having the literature on our shelves. Good can be done only by allowing other persons to read the truth and be given an opportunity to take their stand on the side of the Kingdom, Therefore “clean up” all your foreign-language territory by obtaining all the foreign-language literature you can and distributing it, and “clean up” your booklets by every publisher getting into the field during July with the special combination of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and seven booklets. Use what wrappers you have left over from the June campaign. Use them over anil over again. Try to reach everyone in yolir territory if that is at all possible, and then be prepared foi' the August campaign, &quot;Comfobt.&quot; the Testimony Period that follows July, and later, by the Lord's grace, share in other blessings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1942 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the Newly Interested</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Thousands of new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies are now arranged by the publishers, both special and general. These people are beginning to see the wonderful work the Lord has been carrying on in the earth. So that they may have a keener appreciation of It and to what extent God’s people go to preach this gospel of the Kingdom, they should read the 1942 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font2"> Publishers should take their own copy with them and show it to the interested people at their studies and tell them its advantages and obtain their order at the regular contribution of 50 cents.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Phonograph Needles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The 25-play chromium needle for the vertical phonograph is now permanently out of stock. These have been replaced by loud steel needles of the same length which may be used in the vertical phonograph with two records on turntable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the package is written “One play only”. However, after experimenting, we find that to change needles after every five plays results in longer wear of records; hence we suggest five plays per needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some publishers hesitate to work business territory because they are timid and do not like public places. But the people who are in business places in your territory are the very same people you meet at their residences on Sundays. They are no different from other human creatures, except that very often they may not be at home when one is in their territory; and since many business people spend a majority of their time with their businesses, it means we must go there. Our 'hunting' and 'fishing' work must be done thoroughly; no one must be missed because we didn't try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the companies hold the assignment for business territory in their cities, and they should make sure this is worked. Pioneers are always responsible for the business territory in their assignments unless notified to the contrary. With the carrying over of the special offers into the month of July. July presents an ideal opportunity for visiting the merchants and professional men in your territory. Usually July is a very slow month for most businesses, allowing store clerks and proprietors, doctors, lawyers, brokers, and others more time to themselves between the calls of clients and customers; hence they will be more willing to listen to the publishers without interruption. Monday to Friday are, as a rule, the best days for working business territory; for on Saturdays they are generally too busy to talk to one.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The presentation of the message in business territory is the same as in residential territories. Be clean, present a neat appearance, and speak the truth boldly to those who have a hearing ear. Use the phonograph setup wherever possible, and present the entire combination. If the one to whom you aie witnessing is reluctant to give you much time, because of being busy, be sure to offer him the literature, at least seven booklets on a 10c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the large business houses, department stores, offices, etc., it is well to ask for the person in charge (by name if you know it. or the manager, the doctor, or tvhatever he may be), stating that your business is personal. Witness to him, and then ask permission to speak to some of the employees who are not too busy. In some instances you will not be able to see the one in charge, and then you should witness to the clerk or secretary and anyone else to whom you have access. In offices try to arrange for an appointment at some time in the near future. It may require a little persistence, but we must get the message in some form to everyone if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whenever possible, try to obtain the home address of the person who obtains the literature and arrange for a back-call. Some of the business pioneers have reported good success in arranging for back-calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone Can Do Something</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All publishers, however, may do their share in the business territories during July by presenting the offer to the merchants from whom they purchase the daily necessities of life in their’ neighborhood or community. When calling on the dentist, or at the grocery store, drug store, barber shop, beauty parlor, tailor shop, gasoline station, or any other business establishment, particularly during July, carry along a combination and present the offer. Being already acquainted through business dealings, one will be in a very favorable position and gain a friendly attitude on their part, and one will get splendid results. Try it and see.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Report on “Watchtower” Campaign</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Best Ever</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The servants of Jehovah in many parts throughout the earth were privileged to participate in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign for the four months of February, March, April, and on through May where the brethren did not have many or, in some cases, any foreign-speaking people in their territory to whom to take the “Aiding Refugees” offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord gives abundant proof to his people, not in words only, but in the blessing of their obedient, willing course of action, showing them that they are devising the right way with their heart and that the Lord is directing their steps. Figures don’t lie, and the following report is for the complete campaign for the U. S. A. and the latest figures from England (with more to come).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">New </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions in the United States alone totaled upward of 107,000. More than 23,000 subscriptions were obtained for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> as well. The brethren in the British Isles did excellently during the campaign and sent in more than 23,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> alone. The combined total for new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> magazines in the United States and all foreign countries in all languages in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is published at Brooklyn came to a grand total of 159,970 for the four months’ campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is definite cause to rejoice, as it shows that no wall or barrier is insurmountable for Jehovah’s servants when they have Jehovah, the Most High God, to back them up and direct their steps.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Two Months, and Year Ends</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The “Comfort” Testimony Period, August, 1942. comes one year after the wonderful Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses at St. Louis, Mo. Our minds cannot help but go back to that blessed occasion wherein upward of 115.000 persons assembled to hear the delightful message on “Children of The King” and to receive the comfort that was sent forth from the Lord's Word at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">August would be a very good month for all of Jehovah’s witnesses to ‘turn on the heat’ so that all persons of good-will can come out of the “cold” that will befall all at Armageddon who remain in the Devil’s organization. The responsibility is upon the Lord's people now to proclaim the message contained in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font2"> which will aid everyone to clearly see his responsibility toward the Most High. Order a good supply and stock up your shelves with recent publications in the place of older literature distributed in May, June, and July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remember, too, the fine “Children” record (P-262), to introduce this combination. The Society still has a good supply, and you can obtain them at 70c each. Are your publishers supplied?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is becoming more difficult each day to get around to the distant parts of our territory, but we must trust in the Lord and not slack our hands, and work wherever it is possible to work. Remember, our brethren in war-torn countries have difficulties greater than we have to surmount, not only rationing, heat, and cold, but hunger, starvation, famine, and pestilence, and, above all, the terrors of war, destruction and “gestapo” activities. Through all this they remain faithful, steadfast and true and continue to pro</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>A Few Suggestions on Your Foreign-Language Literature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Reports received here at the Brooklyn office show the publishers everywhere are working hard and putting in much time in the field, with the result that many people of good-will who speak languages foreign to our own are finding comfort by receiving freely of the foreign-language books and booklets which the Lord has arranged for them to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to be ‘blameless before the Lord’, each publisher must cover his or her assigned territory thoroughly with these books and booklets. This must be done during the month of July, as the August Testimony Period should receive our undivided attention. Do not rush through your territory in a haphazard manner after you read this, but spend plenty of time in it and work It right. Take the address of those not at home, and call back on them sometime later on during July. It appears that this opportunity to distribute this foreign-language literature will not come again. It is evident that it is important, as the Lord is giving his people three months to ‘bear their burden’ in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those of the publishers who at claim the message of the Kingdom. In this land and in many others we have the opportunity of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, and we should seize upon every opportunity to comfort all that mourn, during this “Comfort” Testimony Period, August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">There Is Still Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are but two more months to the close of the fiscal year of 1942. What the totals in the placement of literature will be we cannot say; but that is not the important thing. The important thing is the witness that has been given on the part of each individual. Has each remained “blameless in the day of our Lord”, maintained his integrity, fought a good light, and done everything possible in the interests of The Theocratic Government? is the important part. If as far as time in the field is concerned you have not done better than the previous year, why not put forth an extraordinary effort during August and September?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The general report on the part of the publishers everywhere is to the effect that more hours are put in the field in the territory than at any previous time. There is a general increase in number of publishers throughout the country, which is cause for rejoicing, but we have not i yet reached our year's quota, and the end of the year draws near. Will August bring the new peak of publishers? Will you. as an individual publisher, serve during August? How many new publishers will you take out during August? What will your company do to reach a 25-percknt increase over last year's peak? During August let us publish and see to it that every person associated with us in our company has the opportunity to be a publisher. 80,000 publishers in August! Put on the heat!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the beginning of the campaign overestimated the amount of literature they would need should not put it on the shelf when they have thoroughly worked their territory but should turn it over to tiie stockkeeper of the company or unit, to be distributed to other of the publishers who will need more to finish covering their territory. The company servant should keep the publishers informed as to the amount and type of the foreign literature on band. This can be done both by making appropriate announcements at service meetings and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">studies and by posting on the bulletin board a list of the literature available. Then those who did not receive sufficient literature at the beginning of the campaign can likely obtain what they need from the stockkeeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers who are working company territory should follow the same outline as above and turn in what stock they do not need to the stockkeeper of the company with which they are associated. Those pioneers working isolated territory likely do not have a very great supply of this foreign literature, but what they do have they should distribute during July and have it all in the hands of those who can read it.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">information contained in this article is of so great importance to every publisher of The Theocracy that it should have careful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The suggestion is here offered that this particular article be taken up in service meetings so that the servants of the company and all the other publishers of the Kingdom will have opportunity to give it careful consideration. Questions should be prepared on this article tiie same as on the leading article that is studied each week, and at your service meeting tliirty minutes should lie devoted to this article. Divide the article into two parts, and devote thirty minutes of two service meetings to cover tiie points. The Society suggests the weeks of । July 19 and July 26 for taking up this matter of “Everything for the Issue”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Delivery of the Study Course</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Added Privilege and More Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of the Study Course is to encourage the people to read the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book: therefore we want to be sure they receive it. Experience has .shown that many fail to receive the course when it is mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are many reasons why it is advantageous for the brethren to deliver the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> Study Course each week in their individual territories rather than having them mailed. In many instances the brethren have difficulty in obtaining the proper name and address,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eight Months Report Shows Good Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours and Back-Calls on the Increase</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah's witnesses in the United States have shown a marked increase in tiie witness given during the first eight months of the fiscal year 1942. While the report shows a decrease in the distribution of booklets, it has doubled its output of bound books. In eight months 1,603,-000 bound books have been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Outstanding in the report is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Average number of pioneers for eight months, 5,118, to compare with last year's 3,941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers averaged 56,-899, to compare with last year’s 50.383.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the average for eight months there have been 62.017 publishers of the Kingdom, devoting 11.758,341 hours in tiie field. This is an increase of 21 million more hours devoted to singing Jehovah’s praises than in the same period last year. This great increase is. in the main, due to the pioneers’ increasing their average number of hours in the field. Last year the pioneers averaged 105.6 hours, but this year have jumped to 125.2 hours per month iier publisher ; whereas the company publishers’ average number of hours has dropped from 14.9 to 14.4 hours. This can be increased, can’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While there is a splendid increase of 950,000 more back-calls made this year than last year, there is still considerable room for improvement.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>They Must Know</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The publishers of the Kingdom will want extra copies of July 15 issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font2"> The leading article, entitled “Defeat of Pkhsecttion”, will be of real interest to the public. Particularly will the position of Jehovah’s servants be made clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The importance of the second article, “Dissenters for Righteousness,” cannot be overlooked, and due to the fact that there is no arrangement made for group study of this article it is suggested that the first two service meetings in August devote a half hour to the study of this very important information. It is believed that many companies will want extra copies of this particular issue for distribution among tiie people of good-will and in street witnessing. You will do well to place your orders now, so that when printing begins we can print the additional quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">but they do know tiie house and the person witli whom tliey placed the book, and by delivering the course personally they would be certain that the person received it. Perhaps tiie person writing the address on the envelopes cannot read the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> Study Course Order easily, or he may make an unintentional error, thus preventing delivery by mail. Then, too, many of the mail carriers are opposed to the work and fail to deliver the course, and in places where there is much opposition to tiie work some people prefer that neighbors or mail carriers do not perceive their association with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some publishers have found that the mere receiving of the Study Course through the mail is not sufficient to remind the people to read tiie book. But if the publisher delivers the Study Course personally, then he can say a few words concerning reading the book. He will also get familiar with each person’s interest and how much he has read, and get better acquainted with his territory. If he spends time discussing the book he may also report a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 5.118 pioneers made 1.396,117 back-calls: whereas the 56,899 company publishers made 1,594,726 back-calls. Back-calls on the part of the company publishers can be improved materially. The average for the pioneers was 34 back-calls per month, and the company publishers made 3.5 per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the fiscal year 1942 we still have July. August and September to make up any lost time. Those who have been faithfully engaging in the field service will continue to do so, by the Lord’s grace. Those who have been lax for some reason or other should lay hold upon their privileges offered to them by the Lord and work diligently. This excellent report of 8,761.252 books and booklets distributed and nearly 5 million magazines placed in addition to the other literature shows a marvelous witness has been given. Undoubtedly the year's report for 1942 will prove to be the greatest witness the people of the United States have ever had given them concerning the Theocratic Kingdom. We praise the Lord for these blessings and privileges.</span></p>

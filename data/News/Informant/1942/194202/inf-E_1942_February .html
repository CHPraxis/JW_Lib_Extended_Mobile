<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Peak in Publishers Expected</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">We have come to the beginning of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign and to the ‘'Integrity” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are we ready to discharge the responsibility that the Lord has placed upon each one of his publishers during this period—each pioneer to endeavor to attain the quota of one subscription, 10 bound books and 100 booklets per week during the campaign, and each company publisher one subscription, 7 bound books and SO booklets per month during the same period? Everyone should be ready by now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the past two months the new organization setup outlined in Brother Rutherford's letter and the November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> has been in operation. Each one should now have his or her own territory assignment. All should be making their own back-calls and conducting their own studies, both model and book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ever since the convention last August the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> has been distributed, hundreds of thousands of copies have been placed, and on your list are the names of the people who obtained these </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> books and Study Courses. These are all good prospects for a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> There are a great many people of goodwill assembled at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies; all of them should be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers. Let the brethren conducting these meetings take time at the conclusion of one of their studies to show those in attendance the Importance of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">subxo iking</span><span class="font2"> for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> The importance is emphasized in the January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> where it was called to our attention that it may not always be possible to get extra copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> but a real effort will be made to see that the subscribers are provided for. These people will already have had the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font2"> Tell them that they may have as a premium any other bound book they choose instead of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font2"> While we are able to call upon the people we should assist them in getting equipped in every possible way to withstand the dilli-cult times ahead. It may be that we shall not be able to call upon them at some time in the future. In that event </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should be coming to their homes on the 1st and 15th of each month, bringing them the food from the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Campaign Important</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The importance of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign cannot be overstated. All other persons whose names are on your back-call files and who are not already subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should also be called upon and afforded an opportunity to subscribe for it. This should be done us early as possible, so that any who are interested and have only limited means may have an opportunity to save up and subscribe before the campaign ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> clearly reveals that the enemy in every land is going to try to keep the people of goodwill from finding out about Jehovah's Theocratic Organization and fleeing to his Holy Mountain. Therefore we should put forth every effort now to aid the people while we have an opportunity. Quotation from the December 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">is right to the point, clearly revealing the significance of Daniel 11: 45, &quot;And lie shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain,” to be that &quot;the demonized rulers, determined to ‘stay put’ and to control the earth, ‘plant’ their tents between ‘the seas’ (that is, the people in general) and those who are wholly devoted to The Theocracy, and which latter are described in the prophecy as ‘the glorious holy mountain’. ... It appears that in the last desperate stand the religionists, or demonized rulers, will attempt to prevent any and all in the ‘seas’ from coming forth and fleeing to the ‘glorious holy mountain’, which is The Theocratic Government. It may be that at this point the Lord will open the eyes of multitudes, who will escape and find refuge under The Theocracy. The enemy, the totalitarians, will fight desperately and furiously, but ‘he shall find no help’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This assurance from the Lord through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> that no matter what the enemy tries to do his efforts will come to naught, should inspire all of us to go forward with greater confidence and diligence in the Lord's service while it is still day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sunday, February 1, begins the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign and the &quot;Integrity'” Testimony Period. Are all servants and all study conductors fully acquainted with the campaign and prepared to do their part in the local organization? Do you have sufficient additional copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> so that each publisher will have two or more sample copies to take with him into the field for witnessing? If not, order an adequate supply immediately. Do you have sufficient </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription blanks for all publishers? Do you have sufficient </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font2"> in stock to supply you through the campaign? Have you taken up the details of this important campaign at your service meeting and carefully informed the brethren in carrying out every detail so that there will be no slip-ups and errors? Does each publisher have his personal equipment ready—phonograph, records, identification card, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">samples, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> books, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font2"> booklets, subscription blanks, carbon paper, and pencil? Are the back-call names and names of those attending your studies properly arranged? Do you know how you are going to approach these people, and what you are going to say to them when you tell them about the campaign and subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2">? Do you have a notebook and make record of homes where the people are not in? and are you going forward with full faith in the Lord to supply your needs and direct your steps? If all of these details are cared for in advance and you enter the campaign with full faith and confidence in the Lord you cannot help but be successful in accomplishing the good pleasure of His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Points to Consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Taking a Subscription</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When taking a subscription for the magazine always keep in mind that it is necessary to have accurate information on the slip, so that the subscriber can get his copies in good order and promptly. We find that in receiving subscriptions in this office the following difficulties are encountered: Illegibility of names, number, street ami town (the name causes us the most trouble 1 ; the wrong town or wrong street: misspelled names of towns and misspelled names of streets; no street shown on slip. These inaccuracies bring from the post office cards marked ‘‘No such number”, &quot;Not at address,” &quot;Not found,” &quot;Unclaimed,&quot; “Unknown,” etc. ’When we receive these cards we in turn have to find out who sent in the subscription, so that a card can be sent for correction. This creates much unnecessary work, delays delivery of the magazine to the subscriber, and brings complaints. If these points are kept | in mind, and the additional points contained in the January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font2">' which should be carefully studied, much of our troubles will be eliminated and the subscribers will be much better satisfied. Please do your part. Use indelible pencil or ink, only, when making out your subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Watchtower” Introductory Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This record combines P-154 (“Instruction”) and P-262 (&quot;Children”), so that both sides of this record can be put on, because it deals directly with the presentation you are making to the people. Each publisher who uses the phonograph in the field and not having “Instruction” should have one of these new records. We have a good supply in stock. Send in your order immediately. The regular rate is 70c each, or 6 for Jf3.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Continue organizing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies. Every publisher should be conducting at least one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2">book study a week. We quote the experience of one publisher in developing Interest and getting the people all set for a regular study of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Try It</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“For about a month I have been intending to write you about a method I have been using since the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> came out saying we could inform the people concerning the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> Study Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;I am thoroughly convinced the Study Course folders have been directed by the Lord and are an instrument in our hands that can be used to get back-calls quicker than anything I have ever used. Nothing will aid more to stir up the minds of the people to reading the book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> and then to attend a study of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;As I place the book I tell them they will receive some question folders, and to be sure to keep them and I shall be calling on them in a short time to help them with these questions so that they will get the most out of their book. Then during the week after they receive the first folder I call with my Bible, etc. I use the folder and take up the more important questions with them, read the answers and look up the scriptures—those not quoted. After they receive the second. I call and take up the questions on it; and likewise after they get the third folder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“These study folders get the truth to them much faster than any of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> booklets. For example. the first one takes up ‘immortality'. the 'condition of the dead’, the 'resurrection', the ‘trinity’, and the 'establishment of the Kingdom on the earth’. It is taken up in such a simplified, easy way that they get it if they have a little help. Now, that is a lot, too, for one lesson I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The second folder takes up about the 'princes', the 'little flock', and the ‘great multitude', who are Jehovah's witnesses today, and why they are opposed; Armageddon, and how to escape it. That is a lot again to get in one lesson ; but the time is hen* when the ‘strange work’ must be done speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The third folder shows the obligation parents have toward their children, the divine mandate, and the blessings the Kingdom will bring. By the time the third folder is taken up the people have a fair knowledge of the general contents of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font2"> And upon learning that there are no more study folders, they should be anxious to attend a study </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued, on gage</span><span class="font2"> 2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">column</span><span class="font2"> 2)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Work Increasing</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Companies Started</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The new work commencing December 1 is well on its way. The 1,000 special publishers arranged for have been enrolled, and 784 of them were actively engaged in that work during December. 1941. They have been assigned to 435 cities of 4,000 or more population. They have already started more than 1,097 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> studies. The results to date are very gratifying and indicate the Lord’s blessing on this work. Quite a number of new companies have already been organized, and as the work gets under way each day’s mail brings many requests for more applications for company organizations. We hope that before the sixmonth period is up there will be a new company •organization in each of these 435 cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a number of cases the special publishers and other brethren living in the town have already covered their assignment the first time over, placing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and making some back-calls. They have now started on the territory for the second time. The second time they find considerably more interest and, as a result, are held up because of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2">follow-up back-calls that must be made, and model studies and book studies to be conducted. Each time around it seems they are digging down deeper and getting greater and more blessed results all the time. Now they will be stressing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine as well as the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companies likewise have taken hold of this new work with enthusiasm. They have withdrawn from their rural territories and concentrated in towns and cities (except in places where they have only rurals to work). In most cases each publisher is taking out his individual assignment and planning to cover it four times during the next six months, assuming complete responsibility for his assignment to place the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> make back-calls, conduct model studies and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2">book studies, and is finding that it is not nearly as difficult as he thought it would be. Both pioneers and companies have found considerable interest in this new territory. Many of the good-will are joining with them in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both pioneers and companies should arrange for a Sunday </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study, and, if convenient, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font2">service meeting on Thursday night, in these towns and cities, in addition to their regular book studies. These </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies and service meetings should be accessible to the newly interested, and they should be invited to attend. In this way they will become familiar with all the branches of the service work and the privileges that are theirs if they want to take advantage of them. Conductors for these meetings may be arranged for by the special publishers, brothers being utilized, of course, wherever possible. Where there are no brothers available sisters may conduct them. In the company territory the company servant will arrange to assign one of the regularly appointed study conductors or servants to care for these meetings. As soon as a company is organized in each territory, of course, the regular Organization Instructions will apply. When organizing companies, in special publisher territory particularly, local brethren should be recommended for the various servants’ positions rather than the special publishers. The local brethren should be taught to bear their own burdens from the beginning. The special publishers may counsel, instruct and assist them all possible, but let the local brethren do the work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Special Order Blank Enclosed</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Study Carefully</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">there is a special order blank for the May campaign. This is being sent out three months in advance so that the company servant, along with his assistant servants, can study such matter carefully and order such literature as they need. All the Instructions are written on the reverse side of the order blank; these you will please study cabe-lui.LY. All companies should try to have this order blank in to the Society before the end of February, so that we shall have ample time to ship by freight to all companies and pioneers ordering supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How to Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From time to time it becomes necessary to remind company servants and stockkeepers to order in 100-pound shipments. Many of the large companies, it is noticed, order' each week and not always are their orders for 100 pounds. You could just as well add another carton of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> or other books and booklets that are required to bring up your freight shipment to 100 pounds. The Society always ships the cheapest way, and freight is the cheapest. It takes a little longer than by express or mall. If your shipment is not nearly 100 pounds, of course, it Is cheaper to ship by express or mail, because this is based on the pound rate rather than the 100-pound rate; but it means that the Society is spending the money when it could just as well ship you additional literature and you wouldn't have to order as often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We want you to order just as often as you need literature, but when you order, if you can, please make it 100-pound shipments. Your co-operation in helping us save on carrying charges will also help us to further advance the Kingdom interests in other fields.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Study Will Help You</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended</span><span class="font2"> is an instrument provided by the Lord to aid the brethren acting as their own lawyer before the courts. When defending yourself before the court without an attorney, you can read to the judge applicable portions of that booklet as argument in support of your motion to dismiss, aftei' taking the witness stand in your own behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In every instance the brethren should represent themselves without an attorney, if possible, in the police and magistrates’ (or justice) courts, employing a lawyer only for appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each publisher should study regularly, both at home and at service meeting, the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers,</span><span class="font2"> so that every one will be prepared to defend himself in event of any arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended</span><span class="font2"> can also be used to show to policemen who interrupt your work, to show that we are entirely within our legal rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column </span><span class="font2">in the book. I find if I wait four weeks before going back the majority have not read the book. I like to get back before they ‘cool off’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If (he brethren will really go after back-calls and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book studies in this manner they can be successful. Take advantage of all openings and try to really aid these people who are ‘feeling after the Lord, if haply they may find him', to get a better understanding of His purposes, that they may take their stand on the side of The Theocracy before the _ acy will be fought and the issue determined for all time. The Lord's blessing has been particularly upon</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The 1942 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font2"> is now ready for shipment. Everyone who loves righteousness and is devoted to The Theocracy will want a copy so as to read the remarkable report written by Brother Rutherford: and, too, the daily texts and comments will be to them an aid and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daily texts and comments heretofore published in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">will be discontinued, as they are published in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All Calendar orders on hand have been filled, but those still desiring a Calendar can obtain one. Many people of good-will who are as yet not attending meetings may wish this new Calendar to keep before their minds the importance of being &quot;blameless in the day of our Lord&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention, All Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the Inauguration of the “new work&quot; it will he necessary for every pioneer to plainly mark his or her &quot;Change of Address&quot; slip as I to &quot;Pioneer&quot; or “Special Pioneer”. Not all of the &quot;Change of Address” forms which are in the hands of the pioneer publishers are the same, but these can he changed by the publisher so that the ollice will know whether you are a “Special&quot; or a &quot;General”. Changes of address should always be given on the regular “Change of Address&quot; form, and not in letters. If you don’t have any of these forms, order some at once. Any correspondence written regarding your mail or address should clearly indicate either “Special” or &quot;General”. A separate “Change of Address” slip should be sent in for each individual pioneer publisher; two names should not appear on the same slip. Following this suggestion will save needless work in the office here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Used Cartons</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren will please ship only good ones of Society’s cartons, and in 100-pound lots. Carefully read instructions covering this in the December </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The recent close analysis of the country that had to be made in preparation for the new work reveals that there is still great need for pioneers, particularly in the thickly-settled industrial areas of the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now is an ideal time to enter the pioneer service. Undoubtedly many brethren realize the need of devoting their entire time to the Theocratic service in order that they may be blameless before the Lord in this day of judgment. Therefore, serious consideration should be given to the time and circumstances of each one who is consecrated to the Lord and who is not now devoting his entire time to the Kingdom service. to see if he cannot adjust his affairs so that he may be a fulltime publisher. If, after prayerful consideration of the matter, you find that you are in position to enter the pioneer service, write the Society promptly for an application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It will make the hearts of all the servants of Jehovah glad to know that 61,227 persons engaged in the field service in December. Another new peak was reached in the ranks of the pioneers. During December 5,057 reported field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In November, 1939, the pioneers reached a peak of 26.9 back-calls per publisher, and for the first time since that date have the pioneers passed that peak. In December, 1941, they reached a new all-time peak of 29.3 back-calls per publisher in one month. Undoubtedly, with the new work increasing and moving ahead, this peak will be broken sev-| eral times during the year by the pioneers. Have in mind another 1939 peak yet to be broken, namely, that of hours for the pioneer publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> is going out well, and the report shows that during December 212,490 bound books were placed in the United States. This is gratifying. It is believed that with the coming month this total will increase. We are still able to keep up with the demand of orders, and at this writing, you will be pleased to know, more than 1.800,000 copies have already been shipped out of the factory and the presses are still moving on at full speed, with the completion of the 3,000,000 edition nearly in sight. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> should find a wide distribution now, with the Watcft-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign in operation from February 1.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Arrange a Route</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>in Your Territory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The main thing to do now is to call upon the people, place the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> book with them, get a study started as soon as possible, and help the people to take their stand on the side of the Kingdom. That feature of the work should receive first consideration and all other features should work toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, there are times, such as Saturday afternoon and evening, which in your territory may not be good for back-calling because of the many other interests the people have. Further, not all the publishers have back-calls every night. Therefore there is still considerable time that can be spent in magazine work and such time available should be devoted to the magazine street work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The present individual territory arrangement provides an excellent opportunity to develop routes. Publishers going over the same territory four times in six months will be able to locate and get acquainted with the real interest in the territory, and, working the same place every week, they can call back on these people with the magazines regularly. Before the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign is over many of these will be ready to give a year's subscription for the magazine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The obtaining of cloth to make bags has been almost impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Inquiry has been made on the part of companies as to permission to make their own, so that publishers may have them. This is permissible, but they should be made neatly.</span></p>

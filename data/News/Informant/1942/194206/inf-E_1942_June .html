<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>“Willing Volunteers” Testimony Period</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Printing More than 400,000 Copies of Each Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The year 1942 lias witnessed the most thrilling and the most effective </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign to date. For the first time since such campaigns were put on we have exceeded the “100.000 new subscriptions&quot; quota at the end of the three months. On May Ive actually had 101,420 new subscriptions filed with the subscription department. At tiiat time there was considerable mail in the office which had not been put through, and much more in transit, all containing subscriptions tiiat were taken before the first of May. This is a cause for gratitude and thanksgiving for Jehovah's blessing upon the efforts of His people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our brethren in the British Isles have also been richly blessed in this campaign. Because of the difficulties in getting mail through, their figures run one month behind. Despite this, on May 1 they actually had 13,353 new subscriptions through the subscription department, with the big majority of April's subscriptions still to come to hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What the all-round final figure will be, we hope to tell you next month. Indications are that it will be an all-time high. Despite every effort of Satan, the demons, and their demonized human agents, the Theocratic service goes grandly on, surpassing all previous peaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society now prints more copies of each issue of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine than ever before during its 63 years of publication. May Jehovah be honored !</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Great Multitude</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1942 Memorial Report of U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Memorial figures for this year furnish a very interesting and encouraging picture to those who visualize the accomplishment of the Lord’s purpose in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The total attendance in the United States was 84,275; of whom 13,163, or 16 percent of those in attendance, partook of the emblems. That means that 84 percent of those in attendance are prospective members of the &quot;great multitude&quot;; and this for ever answers the question of the skeptical and critical, ‘Where are the evidences of the great multitude?' for it clearly indicates the gradual diminishing of tlie body members of Christ upon the earth, while the people of good-will ‘flee toward the cities of refuge’ in ever-increasing numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last year there were 62,352 in attendance. The foregoing figures show an increase this year of 21,923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of these facts and figures verify our understanding of the Lord's purposes and constitute another evidence of the fulfillment of the Lord's promises to His people. There is much work still to be done. By .Idiot ah's gj-.ice, let us do the ‘hunt ing and fishing' now!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>June a Booklet Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Be Distributed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in the days of Barak and Deborah, the willing volunteers today are enthusiastically pushing to the front and making final preparations for the “Willing Volunteers&quot; Testimony Period, during June. With fine, balmy summer weather, and the most comforting offer of real hope ever presented to the people, and a sincere desire to serve the Most High God and aid the people of good-will, Jehovah's witnesses are today honored above all men in the privilege conferred upon them of comforting all that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All craving Jehovah's approval, whether anointed, Jonadab, or person of good-will just coming to a knowledge of the Lord’s purposes, should have a part in this campaign and really manifest to the Lord and to their brethren that they are willing volunteers in the Lord's army. Each company publisher should show his faith in the Lord and his sincere desire to really do his part in this campaign by getting his ten combinations and then prayerfully set out to place them in the hands of the people. This requirement is not</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Invitation to Children</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Responsibility upon the Parent</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has provided for the safeguarding of his people in these perilous times by keeping them occupied with Theocratic interests. Says the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Today many parents, including some who claim to be entirely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, bring up their children in idleness. They proceed upon the theory that the children should play and do no work. Such is contrary to God's law, and works a great injustice and injury to the children. An idle brain and idle hands lead to disaster.... The parents should explain to the child why work is good for it.... The child Jesus said: 'I must be about my Father's business.’ (Luke 2: 49) When some criticized him for working, the answer was: ‘My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' (John 5:17) All of God's approved creatures must work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Especially at this season of the year there are increased opportunities for the little folk, that is to say, those attending the schools. Almost every school allows from two to three months of summer vacation. To the children we therefore now say, Do not waste your summer in idleness and play. Y’ou have had nearly a year to study the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">book and, no doubt, you have learned in.my wonderliil things which jou want to tell to others. If you have great; it means only a little better than two combinations a week. Each pioneer should take hold of his 100 combinations in a similar manner. We are responsible for putting forth the sincere effort; the Lord will look after the results. If a publisher finds that he cannot place the entire combination of one bound book and seven booklets, lie should have no difficulty in placing the combination of seven booklets on a 10c contribution. Always offer the complete combination first; drop to 7 booklets on a 10c contribution only where the complete combination cannot be placed. For those who desire to present a larger combination, one book and 17 booklets may be placed on a contribution of 50c, or 17 booklets by themselves on a 25c contribution. Another combination is 35 booklets and one bound book on a contribution of 75c, or 35 booklets on a 50c contribution. There is a great variety of presentations that can be made, according to the circumstances and the number of different booklets one has on hand. Let us make this the greatest book and booklet campaign to date. We should have no difficulty in placing at least 5 million booklets during June. Remember EVENING work. For details of the campaign, see the May </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">made a consecration to do the Lord's will, then the obligation is upon you to fulfill that agreement. Take advantage of every opportunity to go with your parents in the field service, or with the other publishers in your company. If your parents love the Lord they will be glad to aid you to do this. They should not attempt to force you to do the Lord's service, but when they explain its importance to you, then you will be glad to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">An Invitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Children under 18 years of age living with their pioneer parents may use their parents' stock in witnessing and send in a separate report with that of their parents each month. This report can be put on a Publishers Daily Report slip and marked. “Working w ith my pioneer parents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Children of company publishers should request their parents to arrange for them to get out in the field service sometime every day, either with their parents or with some other publishers in the company with whom arrangements can be made for them to go into the work. Company servants, throughout the summer, should arrange for daily service if at all possible, so as to accommodate the children and all publishers of the Kingdom. Due to the more daylight hours, evening work parlii uhiily. for all publishers, would be very advanta-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Your Testimony Report Important</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants Should Be Careful as to Whom They Furnish with Testimony Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society lias issued a new testimony card, and the publishers should please note what is printed on the reverse side of this card relative to the claim of the one who signs the card. No individual has a right to authorize one to preach the gospel. That is a commission given by the Lord to each individual who has covenanted to do Jehovah’s will. The Society, to the best of its ability, will recognize, support and aid all faithful and true witnesses of the Kingdom who fall into difficulty or are treated wrongfully because they were serving the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Concerning any individual who claims to be one of Jehovah's witnesses and does acts contrary to Jehovah’s law as well as the law of the land and who is punished by the laws of the land therefor, the Society cannot take any interest in his case. The Society’s work and that of all of Jehovah's witnesses is to see that &quot;this gospel of the Kingdom” is preached, and to this end the Society will support and stand shoulder to shoulder with the brethren against all adversity. Avoid controversies. Comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For some years past the company servants have kept records of the individual activity of Jehovah's witnesses, and the company servant or some other faithful brother can certify as to the activity of a company publisher. Pioneers have their records, as well as the Society, which can certify as to the activity of pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If in the line of duty one of Jehovah's witnesses is arrested or taken into custody, he should always file as evidence his testimony card (which is his identification), the number of years in the truth, the time of the individual's baptism by water immersion, and his attendance at meetings, and his field activity as to the number of hours and number of studies conducted, all showing the sincerity in practice of one claiming to be a minister. Y'our knowledge of the Scriptures and your ability to present the same come only by earnest study and association with the Lord's people, talking to one another and to those of good-will of God's precious promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">geons. Include this in arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go: anil when he is old, </span><span class="font2">he </span><span class="font1">will not depart from it.&quot; </span><span class="font2">1‘ruverbS 22: 6.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>July Work Continuation of June’s</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A Wonderful Work! Are You in It?</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“His word runneth very swiftly. He sendeth out his word, and melteth them.”—Ps. 147: 15,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That is the Calendar text for July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the past twenty years particularly, the Lord’s message or word, in the form of books, booklets and other means, has gone forth swiftly to all those that would hear, and it is having a powerful effect. We now have on hand many of these publications, both in English and in foreign languages, and it is our obligation to get these publications into the people’s bands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In many cases, depending on the type of territory the company or pioneers hold, the offer will be a continuation of the June offer to “Let Them Read&quot; tlie book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Childran </span><span class="font1">and the 7-booklet combination on a contribution of Jac. This will afford the brethren additional opportunity to place thousands more of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font1"> and thus pave the way for many more </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book studies. Also, this offers the opportunity for those who did not meet their quota at tlie end of June to go ahead and surpass that quota by far.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Restrictions Make</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Put In More Time in City Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In these days of rationing it is to be expected that the enemy would see to it that the Kingdom service would be restricted as much as possible. Many obstacles are placed in the way of carrying on the Lord’s work. However, obstacles to the Lord’s people are something to be overcome, and not barriers in the way of progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What are we going to do about these limitations and obstacles—lie down and quit? Surely not! No true Theocbatic witness will ever quit; neither will he waste time ‘bemoaning his fate’. He will survey the situation, make his plans, and carry on in spite of these obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the past the sparsely populated rurals have been worked over and over again, while in many cases city territory has been proportionately neglected. With the existing limitations the brethren everywhere are forced to concentrate in urban territory, that is, cities and small towns, where they can work on foot and call on the people without the need of a car. Other towns and cities can be reached by train and bus, and the work then done on foot from the depots. As far as possible the brethren should work around their own homes or in adjacent territory during the week, and conserve what little gas and tires they may have for week-ends when they can get a good carload of publishers. This would apply particularly to Sunday. What gas and tires the Lord’s people have should be conserved for the Kingdom work, and not be consumed in unnecessary running around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under these conditions the brethren should start early on Sunday, and stay late, so as to get in as much time as possible in these assignments that have to be reached by car, at the least expenditure of gas and tires. This will require careful planning on the part of the company servant, and well-thought-out recommendations to tlie company. It will require of the brethren </span><span class="font2">in the company full co-operation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Literature Still on Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is also a number of companies and pioneers who hold much foreign territory and have not covered that territory with the free foreign literature that was. first offered in May, the “Aiding Refugees” Campaign. This offer was extended into June, and is now being extended into July. Take advantage of this fact and place this remaining foreign literature in the hands of those people who can read it, where it will do some good. Those companies and pioneers who can still use some of this literature during July, please do not hesitate to order, and do so as soon as possible. IMPORTANT—Be sure to state on your order blank that this is to be FREE literature. Otherwise it will be charged to your account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have on hand, ready for shipment, certain books and booklets in the following languages: French, German, Greek, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian. Booklets oni.y in Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, and Tagalog. Books only in Finnish, Bohemian, Japanese. and Arabic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make preparation now for greater activity during July.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Us More Careful</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">in order to meet, in a manner that will result to the glory of the Lord and the advancement of the Kingdom. the ever-increasing emergencies and difficulties that are arising. It is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">certain</span><span class="font1"> that later on there will lie many more restrictions: so let each servant of the Lord put forth a greater effort now and do as much work as possible while the opportunity is afforded. Waste no time— waste nothing!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Baptism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The new identification card definitely states that those who receive the identification and testimony card and who are recognized as representatives of tlie Society are duly ordained and authorized to preach the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An essential requisite to ordination is baptism, both the real and the symbolic. The Lord lias made baptism a definite requirement of those who will be Ids disciples.— Acts 2:38; 8: 2(5-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The real baptism is the submission of one's seif in consecration to the Lord, covenanting to do the will of God from that time forth. Water baptism is an outward demonstration, or confesssion in the presence of others, of tlie consecration that has already taken place in the heart and life of the creature. The real baptism must take place before one can become a disciple of the Lord and be acknowledged as one of his witnesses. The symbolic baptism in water should be performed as soon as possible after the consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All full-time publishers should report (on their personnel card forwarded to the Society) the day, month and year of their baptism, that our records here may be complete on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All companies should arrange for baptismal services two or more times a year, for the convenience of newly interested persons who wish to symbolize. Two or three small companies may get together and arrange for one baptismal service among themselves, if they wish. July is usually a warm month and a tine time to arrange for a baptism in some near</span><span class="font2">by river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Publisher Privileges</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The response to the arrangement made by the president of the Society, contained in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> requesting those brethren who had been enrolled as general pioneer publishers on January 1 or prior thereto to apply for special publisher privileges if they desire to participate therein, has been very gratifying indeed. Hundreds of requests have already come to hand, and in a big majority of cases applications have been forwarded to those brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some brethren, whose hours in the field and back-calls made in the past were so very low, the Society did not feel justified in enrolling at the present time, but recommended that they make request for special publisher activity in three or four months from now, provided they are able to increase their back-calls and hours sufficiently to justify enrolling them as special publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Progress Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many of the special publishers are now covering their territory for the fourth time and want to know what to do next. These special publisher territory assignments are peculiarly the responsibility of the special publishers. They are on the spot; they know the conditions and are in better position to make an intelligent recommendation regarding future activity in that area than anyone else. In a large number of eases a company is already organized : and if this company is functioning properly and able to carry on alone, the specials may advise the Society to that effect and request another assignment of territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In other instances the interest is definitely in evidence but is not yet ready to organize. There is some work to be done among them yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Willing Volunteer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I have been holding a model study with a man and his wife for about a month. They are meek and teachable, and very much interested. Last week, when I called and «e were well into our study tlie man mentioned to his wife something about their being baptized on the previous Sunday. This, of course, gave me a letdown, and 1 said, ‘What church denomination did you join?' The man said, ‘Church! Why, we wouldn't join any church. We read in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Child ten</span><span class="font1"> book where it is proper for a person to be baptized. and we didn’t want to hold anything back from the Lord; so we got an ex-preacher who was a neighbor and went down to the river and told him we just wanted to be baptized and that was all we wanted him to do.' This in the cold month of February surely shows the willingness of the Lord’s ‘other sheep’ to comply with His requirements.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Activity in Flatbush-Bethel Unit</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Since holding this territory the Bethel publishers have increased their number of new workers there from 39 in any one month to 65. A total of 100 different publishers not members of the Bethel family have reported one or more times during tlie past year. The increase in activities continues. The month of February reached four new all-time peaks for this unit. 186 new subscriptions were obtained ; 1,551 back-calls were made, an average of 6 back-calls per publisher; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">book studies increased from 40 to 70. And from all appearances this </span><span class="font2">will continue. New faces are seen </span><span class="font1">before they can be left on their own. In such cases the special publishers should continue in that territory and help the people of goodwill for a month or two longer, at least, and try to get a company organized and established. Under such circumstances the Society should be advised to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tn other places the territory has been thoroughly covered four times and there is no evidence of any real interest and tlie prospects of organizing a company there are practically nil. In such cases the special publishers should advise the Society in detail to that effect and request another assignment of territory. Any good-will names or other information of interest pertaining to the territory that they may have can be turned over to whoever receives the territory after the special publishers are through. If it is turned back to some near-by company this information should be turned over to the company. If it is isolated the information should be forwarded to the Society, so that it can be given to whoever receives the assignment next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the special publishers will keep these points in mind and keep the Society fully informed we can assist them much more effectively and also get them transferred to territory where they can do the most good. It should be kept In mind that the recommendation made in each ease is for the purpose of discharging the responsibilities that the Lord placed upon them. State </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font1"> the facts in your recommendation and have the entire group of special publishers in that territory sign it. Nothing should be done because of a desire to change territories or look for some desirable assignment, but rather that the change recommended is believed before the Lord to be in the best interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at all studies, and especially at the service meetings and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">studies. The Flatbush-Bethel unit is determined by the Lord’s grace to ‘hunt’ and ‘fish’ tlie ‘other sheep’ with increasing zeal as long as Jehovah permits.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Tried?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The churches . . . were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy [spirit], WERE MULTIPLIED.”—Acts 9: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Back in the days of the apostles, u hen persecution and difficulties he-• came great upon them they were separated from one another, and went everywhere preaching the gospel; which the Lord directed. The “churches&quot; (or organized groups of I he Lord's people) were “built up&quot; ( or edified ), and as they were scattered from place to place they preached the gospel and brought the people of good-will together for study, tints organizing them to serve tlie Lord, and the “churches&quot; (or organized groups) wEltE multiplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Excellent opportunity on a much greater scale is now offered the publishers of the new world in the work of organizing more companies. Perhaps it is thought by some that such work is only for pioneer publishers. That is not true. General company publishers have the same opportunity before them to organize a company to take care of the interest in i he territory now held by the company with whom they are associated. Particularly those companies that hold rural towns, villages or hamlets should take notice. It is very difficult for many of the regular company publishers who live in such towns to travel any distance to the headquarters meeting of the company. This is so at Ilie present time and will magnify itself in the future because of the increased rationing and the difficult problem of transportation. Those company publishers who hold such assignments have the great privilege of working toward the end of organizing a company there. The new book 77ic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Neu World</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—('an It Lari I</span><span class="font1"> should be placed with all the people of good-will, and studies started in the book with the aid of the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Netc Woild&quot; Sludll Questions.</span><span class="font1"> Then, when these people of good-will see their privileges and their opportunity and what the Lord requires of them, they will desire to be organized into a study group, and ultimately an independent service organization, that is, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">eompanil. </span><span class="font1">The servants of the company should be enlisted to provide territory, recommend servants, and generally get this new organization functioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new Organization Instructions emphasize the importance of getting these people of good-will together to feed upon the Lord’s provisions. The sole purpose of the Lord's visible organization is to preach the gospel of the Kingdom, to carry out the commandments of the Lord and to comfort those that mourn. Pioneers, general and special, devote their full time to the work of organizing more companies. Isolated territory now being worked by general pioneers should have a company organized in it before the pioneers leave the territory and go to another assignment, if at all possible. The Lord's</span></p>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">blessing and the evident need for more organized study and service groups (companies) is shown by the I fruitfulness of the special publish-| era<sup>-</sup> labor since December, 1941, and i particularly since April, 1942. More) than 2(H) new companies have been ) organized, thus providing a place for ) the hungry &quot;other sheep&quot; to receive instructions and “meat in due sea- j son&quot; from the Lord's table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let each publisher, whether part- I time or full-time, remember the im-j portanee of properly hunting for, feeding and aiding the people of good-will and bringing them to the company study meetings. Where there is no company to which to bring them, work toward organizing a company to carry on the King- i dom service when you leave.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Studies should be arranged in all companies as soon as possible now, so that the truth in the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Nciv World</span><span class="font1"> may be made your own.

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Organization Instructions Helpful</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord through his “faithful and wise servant” (the Society) continues to bring forth things new and old for the edification and use of his people. Ue has now equipped us with new Organization Instructions in order to more systematically carry on the work assigned to us. Each servant in every company should become very familiar with the contents of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ori/anization Instructions</span><span class="font1"> booklet so that he may be able to discharge his obligation to Jehovah and co-operate with his brethren in advancing the Kingdom interests in the most effec-five manner possible. There should I be no difficulties or misunderstandings now among the Lord's people regarding how the Kingdom work should be carried on. If each one will adhere closely to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization </span><span class="font1">I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Instruct ions,</span><span class="font1"> doing the work assigned to him as outlined therein, everything should go along in unity and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Servants to the Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The provision for servants to the brethren to visit all companies at least once every six months is greatly appreciated and provides such additional assistance as the brethren may require in helping them to apply these Organization Instructions to their local territory and conditions. The sole purpose of tlie visits of these brethren to the companies is to counsel and generally aid the brethren in Kingdom service. The.v will have no time for social activities nor time to waste on company or personal troubles. Their job is entirely that of assisting the brethren with their Kingdom problems. Their work with tlie companies commences at S a.m. in the morning, just the same as if they were working in the office or factory. The.v are to carefully check the company publishers' report cards, back-call files, territory files, company accounts, stock and magazine account, and all the other details outlined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ori/anization Instructions.</span><span class="font1"> To do this it will take time and they’ should not be hindered or interrupted. They should receive the full co-operation and support of all the servants. When all the servants and study conductors of each company assemble with the servant to the brethren they should come prepared with all proper records and other information pertaining to their respective work, so that all can intelligently discuss the problems facing the company and take such necessary steps as are required in order to get the work going in the most effective way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">thoroughly considered by each one and explained at the service meeting, so that all the brethren will understand what is required and cooperate fully, that the information forwarded to the Society may be accurate and dependable.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Fathers Will</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">All of the brethren in the company should arrange to participate in the field activity during the time the servant to the brethren is with you, and, of course, should continue therein regularly thereafter. All of the brethren should arrange to be present at the meetings conducted by the servant to the brethren. This is the Lord's provision for assisting each one in bearing his own burdens before the Lord. The New World Theocratic requirements must be the biggest thing in the life of each one of the Lord's people now. Therefore let each one co-operate in doing his part to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Publisher Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the New World Theocratic Assembly, September 18-20, 1942, (here were some SO,000 brethren in attendance Saturday afternoon as the picture of the greater Jephthah unfolded clearly revealing the obligation and responsibilities now resting upon the Lord’s anointed people. The significance of Jeph-thah's vow was revealed to them. His daughter's joyful acquiescence in the obligations involved clearly pictures what the Lord expects of the Jonadabs at the present time. The reality of what was there depicted must be fulfilled in sincerity and in truth by every one of the anointed and their Jonadab brethren on earth today. Every creature that hopes to have the Lord's preservation and protection in Armageddon must come under these obligations and accept them and discharge them faithfully, if he is going to have the Lord's approval. The actuality of these wonderful things can he fulfilled only by participation in the Lord's service now. Every one must be a publisher for the New World Theocracy. And undoubtedly those 80,000 who were privileged to sit at the Lord's table will be anxious to now do their part, 'file Lord, foreknowing conditions and the many difficulties liis people would have to encounter at the present time, lias given us this vision that we might have the faith, courage and devotion to overcome all obstacles and devote our greatest possible effort to the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What Will You Do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During tlie month of October those who recognized themselves in these pictures are among tlie wise ones who have taken part in “The Wise” Testimony’ Period and will continue during November in organizing new studies and even new companies to magnify the name of Jehovah and joyfully participate in the “Victory Song&quot; during December and in whatever other privileges of service the Lord may have for his people during the coming year 1943. If these tilings that the Ixird revealed to us have been received into good and honest hearts they will bring forth fruit unto lift<sup>1</sup> eternal by inducing each one to joyfully participate in the Lord’s service now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">If you will look on your Calendar for 1942, you will notice that Decem</span><span class="font2">ber </span><span class="font1">is designated as the “Victory Song’’ Testimony Period. Every one of the Lord's people knows without a question of doubt Hint the King. Christ Jesus, will be victorious in the final battle and for ever silence every part of the Devil's organization. Next to the Bible, the new publications that the Lord has provided for your use in the witness work are the greatest sources of strength and courage for you to “march forward” with determined zeal in the Lord's service that are in existence. The Lord's people go forward in the service with much enthusiasm and vigor. They know that the Theocracy under the lead of our King, Christ Jesus, can't lose out in the conflict, come what may, and they are on the winning side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s organization, The Theocracy, is constantly advancing— we are given many new effective instruments for carrying on the Lord's warfare, and we also find new and more effective methods of wielding these weapons that the I,ord has given us. Let every Theocratic publisher —special pioneer, general pioneer, and company publisher—take notice of the following method of presenting this gospel message and use it in your own territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nearly every company has some territory that is not being worked regularly and is not assigned to an individual publisher. Each company should arrange for group witnessing in these sections of territory on Sundays. Publishers should work their individual territories during the whole week, seven days if possible, as outlined below. Others who cannot handle individual assignments, and new publishers, should participate in group witnessing on Sundays, going into unassigned territories and working outlying towns that are not reached regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the first day cover the territory thoroughly with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">alone. The publishers will knock on every door, or ring the doorbell, and when the party answers the door the publisher will then hand the parly just a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> in a friendly and interested manner, asking the person to kindly read it. It is important to establish friendly relationship and interest on this visit, then leave. Do not engage in any extended discussion of the work at this time. Just leave one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 11 with every family in the entire territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font1">week later the same group of brethren should go over the same territory with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> The brethren each going to the same doors they did the previous week, the people v ill recognize them and it will be more of a personal, friendly call. They will have more confidence in you and will more readily accept the message you have to offer them, and your placements should show a marked increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many more </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> will be placed by each company if this method of working the territory is used. Some publishers do not seem to realize what an Important part the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> plays in pushing forward the Theocratic interests. Many more people will read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font1"> with its striking introduction and its timely message, and will have a better understanding of what the literature is about. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom.

From the very beginning of the Assembly, the Lord, through His instrument the (treater Jephthah, gave the ‘go ahead’ signal. All the publishers of the Kingdom, from that moment on. saw there was no slowing up. and the importance of doing the Lord's work and continuing no matter what comes.

<p><span class="font0">New Publishers Can Do It</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every newly Interested person in your territory attending studies should be invited to have a part in this wonderful work. Many new publishers can be started in the field service for the first time. Let everyone who desires to do the Lord’s will obey this “call to action&quot; and joyfully go forward and let all those people in your territory have a chance to take their stand for the New World. If the people cannot take the book, then be sure to leave a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> in every home where they promise to read it. Wherever you leave a book or booklet or wherever they show any signs of interest, be sure to take their name and address, and call back on these people. The publishers should continue to make back-calls on these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many times some homes receive several copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News, </span><span class="font1">while other homes do not receive any. If the above method of working your territory is carried out, then every home will receive at least one copy of each issue, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">only one. </span><span class="font1">The servants of every company should get together immediately and make arrangements to put in operation the above arrangement. This work should be well planned and organized in advance, so that it will be carried out smoothly and effectively. Every time a new issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> is printed every company should see to it that one is placed in every home in their territory, and then followed up with the latest publications. We feel sure that all the companies will show a marked increase in hours, back-calls, and new publishers. Everyone should be enthusiastic over this new provision and anxiously carry out these instructions.

<p><span class="font1">The book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font1"> released by the president of the Society in an inspiring lecture “Fighters for the New World”, is the greatest yet. It’s a marvelous book, and a provision of the Lord. Immediately after its release all publishers got their copy and were anxious to learn of its contents. Now learning of the precious truths, which are as ‘fine gold’, even choicer than 'fine gold&quot;, they are reaching the people of good-will and giving them the opportunity to read also. The publishers who were fortunate enough to obtain a supply at the various convention cities, and to replenish their supply since, by stock from Brooklyn, are sending in splendid reports as to its distribution. The people want to know of the New World. Are you giving them the chance to learn?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The last release of the convention came after the Sunday afternoon discourse. ’The public meeting surely had the Lord’s rich blessing.

<p><span class="font1">There are many children who are not pioneers, working with their pioneer parents. There seems to be some question as to whether they should send their reports to the Society or report through some company. When pioneer parents are working in isolated territory where there is no company organization, their children should each put their report for the entire month on a Publisher's Field Service Report form ( S-41 and write at the bottom of the slip, &quot;Working with my Pioneer parents&quot;, and then the parents should send this slip to the Society with their own monthly report. Where pioneers are working in company territory, co-operating with the company, and attending meetings, I heir children should each then turn their report of activities in to the company just as any other company publisher would. When they report to their local company, they should not send a report to the Society direct; otherwise their report would be counted twice. In cases where pioneers are working at the extreme end of company territory and it is impossible to attend the meetings of that company, their children may make out their report at the end of the month, to be sent to the Society with the report of their pioneer parents. just as though they were in isolated territory. Children of special publishers may report direct to the Society as outlined above.</span></p>

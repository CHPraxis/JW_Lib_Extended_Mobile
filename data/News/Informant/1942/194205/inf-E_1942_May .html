<p><span class="font2">Jehovah, in loving-kindness, is again arranging for another great witness to lie given to his name and kingdom during tlie month of June. The “Willing Volunteers” Testimony I’eriod offers all the servants of Jehovah the opportunity to show themselves willing in this day of Jehovah’s power. For the month of June provision is made io place thousands of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and millions of booklets in the hands of these people that are starving and in need of something comforting and substantial. This necessary food the Lord has placed in the hands of the companies and pioneers for distribution, and a determined effort should be made during this Testimony Period to see that all people in their respective territories be afforded the opportunity to feed upon the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer for the “Willing Volunteers” Testimony Period is the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and seven booklets, on a contribution of 35c, each combination including the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope. </span><span class="font2">If the party has already obtained </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> then any other bound book published by the Society may be substituted. If they do not wish to contribute 35c, then offer them the seven-booklet combination of 4 self-covered and 3 colored-cover booklets on a contribution of 10c.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">publisher, whether pioneer or company publisher, should set himself a weekly quota and strive to meet that quota.

<p><span class="font2">days of January, 1941, an excellent witness was given to the people of this country with a booklet offer of 7 booklets, on a 10c contribution. During December, 1940, 50.000 publishers placed in tlie hands of the people well in excess of 5 million booklets. During the 12-day extension of this Testimony Period over into January. 1941, more than 21 million booklets were placed, thus adding up to a grand total of over 7, million booklets for the 43 days of the Testimony Period. This included also the placements of the 3,500 pioneers enrolled at that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">For the purpose of displaying the booklets, the Society has prepared an attractive wrapper to be used to bind the booklets together in one package. A brief statement of comforting facts appears on the wrapper. This will enable the people to see at a glance what you have. These wrappers are being consigned to the companies, with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> on the basis of 8 wrappers for each company publisher; and the general and the special pioneer publishers will receive 90 wrappers each. The wrapper should be used over and over, when possible, as only one consignment will be made. The wrappers can be so pasted as to fit loosely over the combination of booklets, and then when the booklets are presented to the obtainer the wrapper can be slipped off without any difficulty and be used again in the same manner. It is suggested that whenever possible a group of the brethren get together sometime when it won't interfere with the witness work and paste up a supply of these wrappers so the publishers may obtain them ready to use when they get their literature.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Attention, All Pioneers, Company Servants, and Stockkeepers !</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Freight rates are increasing. It is imperative that all branches of The Theocracy co-operate more closely in the matter of ordering literature and supplies. You would receive your orders promptlj. and we would have less mail to handle and invoice, if more 100-pound shipments could be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A 100-pound shipment would average about 145 clothbound books weighing 7/10 of a pound each, or 21 cartons of booklets weighing about 8 pounds per 100 booklets. Standard eartons hold on books, except </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> of which they hold 50; and this size of carton holds 460 colored-cover booklets, 500 selfcovered 64-page booklets, or 1,000 32-page self-covered booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers and companies should not send in more than one or two orders a month, and should make those 100-pound orders if at all possible. Isolated pioneers or those small companies where there are no pioneers should send in only one order a month, regardless of size, except in an emergency. If a pioneer or company persists in sending three or more orders a month and of less than 100 pounds, we shall have to hold the orders and combine them, so that shipping expenses may be kept down. This will mean a delay to you and extra work here, which can be avoided with a little planning and care. A company and pioneers in the same town or territory should send in their individual orders in one envelope, and made out to be shipped to one address, preferably that of the company servant. All pioneers combining their orders should give one shipping address (that of the pioneer to whom the shipment is to be sent), and include them in one envelope. Pioneer orders going to different shipping points should not be put in the same envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We should not receive many orders marked “RUSH”. But if an emergency should arise as a result of circumstances beyond your control. then it will be all right to send in a “Rush” order. Do not mark as a “Rusli” order every order you send in: do so only when absolutely necessary. Always try to anticipate your needs far enough in advance to send your order to Brooklyn and allow it to be routed in the most economical way. Today shipments are being delayed by “war priorities”.</span></p>

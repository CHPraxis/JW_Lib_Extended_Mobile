<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Bible and Book Offer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Faithful and true to God’s Word the Bible! Tried and tested in its allegiance, loyalty, love and duty to the Most High God, Jehovah ! Unswerving continuance in Jehovah's service blessed by unbounded privileges and opportunities ! This is Jehovah’s organization and he is using it to accomplish his purpose of preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all parts of the earth. Why should not Jehovah’s servants staunchly uphold and defend the “right works” and divine principles of this theocratic organization?—Josh. 23:8, Mo.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> If we are to act in harmony with Jehovah’s will and receive his approval, we will happily give forth the good news in company with our brothers. This not only will bring us contentment and joy but also will serve to impress and influence others to recognize the organization Jehovah is using. As a new-world society, we will want to move forward during November calling on the people by engaging in the house-to-house ministry and presenting the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </span><span class="font3">and a book, on a contribution of .$2. Loyally present this excellent offer at every door so all persons contacted will have opportunity to obtain the combination.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> A well-balanced and planned service will bring us into closer association with Jehovah and his theocratic organization. Determine new to be at the Sunday contact point at the time arranged by the congregation. Discuss the text no later than 9:30 a.m. and leave promptly for the field. After working for two or more hours in the house-to-house ministry, increase your service opportunities by calling back on persons of good will who have shown some interest in the Kingdom message. A change from one form of activity to another is very’ refreshing and also enables Jehovah’s servants to properly care for the sheep found. It should be remembered that the back-call and home Bible study features of the service are part of house-to-house activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Prepare now to take advantage of the holiday observance and aid persons of good will to know how they can properly thank Jehovah for all his acts of undeserved kindness. Arrange for field work and help all</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New U. S. Quotas for 1954</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Are you a regular house-to-house preacher of the good news? Do you follow up placements of literature and interest shown by persons of good will with back-calls and arrange to start home Bible studies? If so, in addition to having a full share in this service yourself, undoubtedly’ you can be of much assistance to others as they’ begin these vital features of the service. If you are not a regular house-to-house publisher, then you should work diligently to improve your ministry by availing yourself of the training program in house-to-house preaching now being conducted in each congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In stressing house-to-house witnessing at the New World Society Assembly, Brother Knorr made the following statement: “The most essential and effective service that anyone can render to God is to serve in house-to-house work. This is the big step on the part of a publisher toward maturity and his aiding someone else to get into Jehovah's organization.” Further, in discussing the house-to-house work, he stressed the importance of making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies, since this work is a part of house-to-house preaching. Each publisher was encouraged to work toward the goal of being able to give a three- to eight-minute sermon at the doors and then to follow up associated with the New World society to loyally engage in house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Unswerving continuance in Jehovah’s service is the keynote for developing loyalty. Keep abreast of Jehovah's theocratic organization as it takes the lead in rendering to God a consistent service of praise. It is the Word, the spirit and Jehovah’s organization that stir us to vigorous and loyal worship. Thus every servant of Jehovah filled with appreciation of God’s goodness will want to joyfully and zealously serve the Kingdom interests, at all times taking fullest advantage of the small‘opportunities as well as the large ones. This is loyalty to God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">with back-calls and home Bible studies. Can you give a discourse of ten to fifteen minutes when making a back-call and be prepared to answer Bible questions? All of this is part of growing to maturity and becoming effective preachers of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize Now</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Since the new arrangement for the more mature publishers to assist the new and irregular publishers in becoming efficient house-to-house publishers became effective September 1, each congregation should organize this training work immediately. It is not necessary to wait until the circuit servant serves the congregation. Rather, the congregation servant, working closely with his assistants, should select capable servants, study conductors, pioneers and congregation publishers to train others who need assistance. These should be paired up with the less mature and inexperienced ones in house-to-house work. More experienced publishers should take the lead and instruct the ones assigned to them in a mature and loving manner. Efficient organizing can be done through the congregation book-study arrangement. When the circuit servant arrives a good start will have been made in this new theocratic arrangement for preaching the good</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Defeating Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“We are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” (2 Cor. 4: 9, NW) Just as this was true in the days of the early church, so it is true today. Jehovah does not abandon his people in their trials, nor can the adversary by persecution destroy them or remove them from the light of Jehovah’s favor. Persecution may come from many different sources, not the least of which will be the false religious guides. However, godly courage and persistence can defeat this persecution, as shown by the report from Belgium and India. (104, 105, 192)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even political persecution can be turned to advantage and defeated if the brothers bear in mind that they are Jehovah’s witnesses and seize every opportunity to talk the truth to others. Our brothers in Hungary have done this. (189)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">State discrimination against God’s servants and in favor of some other religious body does not discourage or stop us from making theocratic progress, as shown by the report from Taiwan. (205) Sometimes what appears to be a crushing blow at the hands of the enemy will actually prove to be a boon in the end if we patiently and calmly continue with our God-given work. (215, 216)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Persecution in one’s own family can be defeated too, often with happy results. (220) Personal bodily punishment and the seizure of personal possessions bring a great trial, but trust in Jehovah will enable one to defeat this persecution too. (262) Persecution will not destroy the New World society under the leadership of its victorious King, who himself defeated all persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Modern Gamaliels</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Do not meddle with these men, but let them alone.” That was the wise advice Gamaliel of old times gave to those who would interfere with the preaching of the good news. (Acts 5'38, NW) In modern times there are also honest persons who render assistance to Jehovah’s servants by exercising a similar influence upon would-be disrupters of new-world activity. (197)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Syria a Moslem sheik intervened in behalf of a pioneer brother who was being held in prison and used his influence to effect the brother’s release. (210)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Often the effort is made by opposers to induce the law enforcement agencies to interfere with the witness activity, sometimes with a measure of success. But there are still persons who are not afraid to stand for what is right, as shown by the “Yearbook” report from Peru. (244) The same is seen in Switzerland. (274)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At times favorable intervention to help overcome distressing problems comes from unexpected sources, as in one instance in Ecuador. (148) In Libya there are persons who regard the witnesses with a “let them alone” attitude and who are not afraid to say so despite pressure from the clergy. (152, 153) Swaziland and other African countries have tribal chiefs who have taken a stand against unwarranted interference by the clergy. (266) It is prudent for all who contemplate opposition to ponder well the warning of Gamaliel to desist from interference with these ministers of good news, “otherwise, you may perhaps be found fighters actually against God.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>By Using the Bible At the Doors</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “Philip opened his mouth and, starting with this Scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus.” (Acts 8:35, A<sup>T</sup>W) Did you ever try Philip’s approach in witnessing to persons? After introducing yourself, making known your mission and what you have for the people, a very effective witness can be given by reading a few select texts from the Bible and weaving them into your witness. For instance, one might say:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> “The Bible contains many promises concerning a new world and the righteous conditions that will exist in it. Prophets of old foretold its coming, and Christ and his disciples preached of the Kingdom that would usher in these conditions. The apostle Peter wrote to Christians in his day, ‘But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.’ (2 Pet. 3:13, AAV) But, undoubtedly, you have wondered just when these conditions will be realized. Man has kept hoping for centuries but he lives only a few years, undergoes much suffering and then dies. And, viewing world conditions, there seems to be little hope for improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> “But Peter also wrote, ‘Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Hebrew Scriptures” to Be Studied</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New School Schedule for 1954</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Since its release at the New World Society Assembly, Kingdom publishers have been acquainting themselves with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.</span><span class="font3"> It is good for this portion of Jehovah God’s Word to be systematically considered, verse by verse, at the ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new schedule provides for careful and thorough coverage as follows: Special chain words have been selected </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font3"> instruction talks. The first and second speakers will each read about four pages of the Bible and then point out features of the footnotes as well as make comparisons with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">King James, American Standard</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font3"> versions. The third student speaker will give an interpretive talk based on the Bible pages read by the first as some people consider slowness.’ (2 Pet. 3:9, A'II’) Would it not be to our eternal benefit, then, to consider what God has to say about his new world? When we turn to his Word, we learn of his purposes and how he will bless people of all nations in his set time and way. First of all, he will soon destroy the wicked persons. Then all mild-tempered ones will inherit the earth in harmony with the promise made at Matthew 5:5, ‘Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.’ You are invited to obtain this copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> that I have been quoting from and read for yourself the good things contained in the Bible.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> At this point you can highlight some of the outstanding features of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> and how the individual should live now so he might live in that new world. Chapter 22 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font3">shows how and when God will establish his new world. By thus reading pointed scriptures from the Bible to substantiate your witness, you can achieve greater variety in your three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors in the house-to-house work. Usually when the door is opened the person wants to know who you are, what your mission is and what you have to offer. Cover these points first and then use the Bible in your witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">two speakers. Then, under the direction of the school servant, the congregation will have ten minutes to make additional comments on the material read by the first two speakers and to express what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has said on some points of that reading not covered by the third speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A copy of the new ministry schedule is enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">for each member of the congregation. In addition to providing the weekly schedule, new instructions for study are found on the reverse side. There are several changes from the arrangement used in considering the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font3"> so it Is suggested that at a service meeting in December time be devoted to considering the new instructions. This will enable all to have clearly in mind the new arrangement.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first demonstration illustrates how “Make Sure of All Things” can be effectively used on a back-call. The second demonstration highlights talking points that may be used in presenting the “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures” this month.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">SCENE I (7 min.) Mature publisher “A” has new or less mature publisher “B” along- on back-call in home of Mr. and Mrs. Goodwill. Mr. Goodwill remarks that he has wanted to know more about Jehovah’s witnesses and their organization. He has heard others say that “they claim only they are right.” “A” responds that many persons say that without knowing facts about Jehovah’s witnesses or what the Bible has to say on God’s witnesses, and takes out “Make Sure of All Things” and reads aloud opening paragraph of the Foreword. “B” follows in his copy. “A” reasons along lines found on page 5 and suggests they find basis for religion advocated by Jehovah’s witnesses by letting the Bible speak for itself. Checking contents of “Make Sure of All Things” “Jehovah’s Witnesses” is located on page 193. “A” gives high points found in definition, points to Christ as foremost witness, selecting appropriate and key scriptures, and has “B” and Mr. and Mrs. Goodwill take turns reading. High points of scriptures are emphasized as discussion proceeds. “A” tells of prominent men in past who served as faithful witnesses. Jehovah, not men, is Founder and Christ is Leader; not a political government. (Pp. 195, 196) Moving along, “A” outlines work of Kingdom ambassadors—not conversion, but preaching —and says that each witness is a minister. (P. 197) This leads to life and many will yet join in this most important work. (P. 198) In conclusion “A” emphasizes to Mr. and Mrs. Goodwill the importance of adhering to God’s Word for complete and reliable information, and arranges to return next week to further discuss the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE II (7 min.) Next week finds the two publishers ready to take up subject of the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses not completed last time. With “Make Sure of All Things” in hand “A” turns to “Minister of God.” (P. 263) Scriptures are noted and read that tell of God’s Chief Minister and also pre-Christian ministers. Ordination and training are next discussed. (Pp. 264, 265) “B” points out that women and children too may be ministers, which surprises Mr. and Mrs. Goodwill. (This is found under “Women” and “Children” in the “Subjects for Study” section.) Preaching is a must and there is no retirement for God’s true ministers. (P. 267) Flock is God’s, not man’s. Various forms of preaching are briefly touched on as “A” discusses added information found under “Street Work” and “Conducting Studies.” (Pp. 269, 141) He explains what comprises a congregation and why ministers use literature in their preaching. (P. 270) “B” adds that ministers of Jehovah do not profit from or peddle God’s Word, giving proof texts. Mr. and Mrs. Goodwill admit Scripturalness for all to be ministers and that they understand the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses better. “A” brings out “Let God Be True” and points to chapter “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” and arranges to call back next week for consideration of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE III (2 min.) Conductor sums up value and use of “Make Sure of All Things”. It is a convenient reference to use when answering questions and clarifying doctrines. Use it always.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the service meeting a week before this demonstration the congregation servant will explain that we have studied the “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures” in our ministry school and appreciate its value. It has cleared up many difficult points for us. We know what it contains, and we can help people of good will to profit spiritually from it. November and December give us the opportunity to talk pure Bible to people and prove to them that the Bible is the basic textbook of Jehovah’s witnesses. He then announces that at the next service meeting comments will be heard from the congregation as to what people like to see and hear when the “Greek Scriptures” are presented to them. What rouses their interest and convinces them? He may assign to different sections of the audience (or individuals in a small congregation) outstanding portions, such as Matt. 5: 24, 25; John 11; 1 Cor. 13; 2 Tim. 3; Heb. 11; Rev. 12, etc. They will prepare to tell what outstanding points in these chapters can be used in presentation. Comparative readings of the “New World Translation” and the “King James” or “Douay” versions may be given so that superiority in clearness of the “Greek Scriptures” can be shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the demonstration is put on at the service meeting, it will be divided into three parts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE I (5 min.) What do the people respond to? Comments from the audience will be heard as assigned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE II (5 min.) Outstanding points of interest in “Greek Scriptures.” For this part brothers and sisters may come to the front or stand by their chairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE III (8 min.) Successfully presenting the “New World Translation.” Brothers and sisters who were successful in placing the offer in September may be selected and notified in advance to come to the platform with prepared explanations and comments to relate. They will tell the method of approach and argument used when presenting the Bible and book combination successfully. This demonstration will aid the congregation to prepare and give a more effective presentation of the current offer.</span></p>

We should endeavor to reach this by the end of December, and then go on to a 20 per cent peak of 167,959 publishers by the end of April. Hitting a 20 per eent peak will help to maintain a 10 per cent average for the entire year. Are you working toward these quotas?

<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Week of the</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Circuit Servant’s Visit</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The new schedule outlined by the Society for circuit servants provides for five and a half days with each congregation and enables everyone to derive maximum benefits from his visit. To assist circuit servants in meeting their requirements and to ensure the full cooperation of all, the following information is given.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> His week with a congregation starts Tuesday at 1 p.m. The afternoon will be spent checking records. At 6:30 p.m. he will talk with special and regular pioneers and check their records. The entire congregation will assemble at 7: 30 p.m. for the weekly ministry school and service meeting. (Meetings may be held in customary order. Only during the circuit servant’s visit will they be changed to Tuesday.) At the conclusion of the meetings the circuit servant will give appropriate counsel and outline theocratic activities for the rest of the week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> From 9 a.m. to 12 noon Wednesday, Thursday and Friday the circuit servant will take the lead in house-to-house work, training publishers to give an effective witness and to become teachers of others. The first home should be reached by 9 a.m. Regular house-to-house witnessing or back-call and Bible study work will be done from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Evenings will be spent with congregation book study groups. On Tuesday evening he will indicate which groups he will visit. House-to-house magazine work may be scheduled before the study. Regular conductors, except where a sister is appointed, will conduct the study. The circuit servant will give a fifteen-minute talk after the study and invite all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> participate in field work the next day from the study location, which will be the contact point for the next day’s service. He will work with as many of the study group as he can, having in mind first of all training more mature ones so they in turn will ments so the interest does not grow cold and die. Jehovah has set the example by his pure love shown to us every day. We can best worship him in holiness if, in the same pure, loving manner, we care for those manifesting a desire to learn to serve him.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark32"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">be in position to train others in house-to-house witnessing after he leaves. Congregations with one or two studies will have them Wednesday and Thursday. Devote the other evening (s) to back-calls and Bible studies. If there are more than three congregation book studies, the circuit servant will work with other study groups on his next visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Saturday is Magazine Day. From 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. house-to-house or store-to-store magazine work will be featured. Group contact will be at the Kingdom Hall or some other central location. The entire day for the circuit servant will be spent training others to do magazine work. At 6: 30 p.m. he will meet with all servants and congregation bookstudy conductors, and at 8 p.m. will give to the congregation an instructive hour talk on field service. Persons of good will should be invited to attend this and all other meetings during the week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> All will want to be at the Sunday morning contact point at the time set by the circuit servant. Start witnessing at the first door by 9: 30 a.m. and, if possible, continue to 1 p.m. In the afternoon or evening he will give a public talk, followed by the regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">study, and then a thirty-minute final discourse.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The urgency of our times requires a full five-and-half-day schedule to inaugurate and carry through the advanced training necessary. It enables the Society’s mature representative to counsel, teach and train many in house-to-house preaching as well as deliver Instructive talks. To properly care for his work and to meet the quota set by the Society, the circuit servant will require proper rest each night. All should co-operate to this end. The entire congregation’s co-operation will be assured if each one will become acquainted with his schedule and, among other things, be at meetings and contact points on time and, if possible, spend full mornings and afternoons in field service.</span></p></li></ul>

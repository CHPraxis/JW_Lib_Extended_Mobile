<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Our 14th </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> campaign during 1952 was a real success, 264,159 subscriptions being obtained in four months. This fine total was reached only because we planned, organized and then had an active part in the campaign, with Jehovah’s blessing. Servants organized company activity; good introductions were prepared individually, which resulted in a proper and effective presentation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> at the doors.

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Circuit Assemblies Resume After 1953 World Assembly</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In order to provide for the great expansion work that is taking place in the earth under the leadership of our reigning King, Christ Jesus, the Society finds it necessary to rearrange the entire circuit and district setup in the United States. In this adjustment 26 new circuits will be created, making a total of 161 circuits in the country, incorporated in seven districts. The size of circuits will be reduced from approximately 25 companies at present to about 18 or 20 companies. This will make it possible for the circuit servant to visit isolated persons, organize new companies and give better attention to the circuit requirements in general. Companies will be advised regarding their new circuit and servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> These new arrangements will go into effect February 1, 1953. From February 1 until after the world assembly there will be no circuit as</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> “A 10 per cent increase by the end of January,” some might be thinking. “Yes, we can do that. But a 20 per cent peak increase by the end of April?” Yes, it can and will be reached if each Kingdom publisher has proper fear of Jehovah and grasps his opportunities to serve. Let each publisher now associated with the companies </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">regularly</span><span class="font6"> take part in the preaching work and we will reach a 20 per cent peak over the 1952 average by the end of April. New publishers are going out into the field regularly; they will provide a good margin of increase. But brothers already associated are the ones who must determine to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font6"> publishers and fulfill their dedication vow by preaching, especially from house to house, every month. If all do this, the great majority of companies will exceed 20 per cent increase by the end of April and can write “We made it!” on their report cards.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Proper fear of Jehovah prompts all servants to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font6"> in the ministry, the basic feature of which is house-to-house preaching. Will you publish every month in 1953?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">semblies in the United States. This will enable each circuit servant to become familiar with his new territory, with the various companies in the circuit, to consider the brothers who can be used more effectively in circuit assembly activity, and care for other details pertaining to work in his circuit. In addition to serving the companies, his job during this period will be to organize the new circuit and keep it moving forward, preparatory to the active expansion we anticipate following the world assembly next summer. Brothers in the various companies should cooperate wholeheartedly with the circuit servants, particularly in the selection of circuit assembly locations, halls and other details necessary to the success of these assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The Society will divide circuit funds on a pro rata basis, according to the average publishers transferred from one circuit to another. Cir-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Publicly and from House to House” </span><span class="font4">To “worship Jehovah in holy array” requires his dedicated servants to bear united witness to his name. Visiting people at their homes and talking to them about the Kingdom is the primary way of doing this. The 1953 “Yearbook” shows that house-to-house preaching is vitally essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Colombia a trip to an isolated town and baptism of nine new witnesses were followed immediately by two hours of house-to-house preaching, with the new ones in the forefront. (135) Brazil’s report demonstrates that new publishers take hold of door-to-door work readily. (110) Even a retired army officer in Libya does not shun house-to-house activity. (153) It is recognized as a mark of God’s true servants, as demonstrated in the Gold Coast and Hong Kong reports. (172, 186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pushing house-to-house preaching to the forefront brings many blessings. In Honduras the brothers find a great increase in their service averages because of this (184) With servants taking the lead in this feature of Kingdom work in Jamaica good results are forthcoming. (199) House-to-house preaching does much to stimulate interest in the truth, even compelling clergy to go from door to door in an effort to counteract the good news in Puerto Rico. (251)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For most publishers house-to-house activity is not as hard as for one brother in the Virgin Islands. (253) At assemblies, too, all publishers should engage in house-to-house activity, as the brothers in Surinam do. (269) Even those who have never had contact with the company service organization see the need for house-to-house preaching in Costa Rica (137) Indeed, how else would the good news be preached m all the inhabited earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Gathering of Ourselves Together”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fear of Jehovah as Sovereign prompts all servants to attend his table by giving diligent attention to meetings. This means recognizing, conforming to and appreciating the organization God is using. How much do you appreciate meetings? As much as brothers in Costa Rica who brave bad weather and hours of walking to reach the meeting place? (137)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have been in the truth a long time, do you have the same view oi meetings as our fourteen new brothers in Zacapa, Guatemala, who have a 100 per cent meeting attendance? (177) One must always guard against losing appreciation of meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you have opportunity to attend a meeting in a peaceful and quiet Kingdom Hall or other auditorium, think of our brothers in the Luangwa Valley area of Northern Rhodesia, where the roaring of lions is great enough to drown out their singing #of Kingdom songs around the campfire. (228) Do you have such threats to your meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you ever been impressed with the importance of taking an active part in meetings you attend? Has it occurred to you how you might help others? At a company book study in Panama a man with poor eyesight called upon the brothers in attendance to comment so that he and others might be enlightened. (240) Another man of good will in Panama desired a study twice weekly, of two hours’ duration. In two weeks his questions were answered. The third week he and his family commenced attending the “Watchtower” study. By the fifth week he was going in service. His zeal rapidly increases because he prepares for meetings. (241) Do you appreciate meetings that much?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The following has been used effectively : “I am calling this morning for a rather unusual purpose, and it has to do with the very serious conditions world-wide. Sorrow, distress among peoples, races and nations—surely these were never intended to be the lot of humankind. Why, then, do they exist? Think a minute. People do what is in their minds, don’t they? In turn, their minds are filled with what they absorb and meditate on. How obvious it is, then, that evil conditions result from evil thinking and improper mental nourishment. The contrast is likewise true: If we fill our minds with the truth of God's Word, then it will direct our thinking and actions along a path pleasing to God and beneficial to one another. To satisfy this need for proper thinking, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine is published with its entire contents being devoted to Bible subjects of current educational value. You will notice the great variety of subjects with</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During the week of March 15, 1953, the ministry school will complete the study of the A'etc </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</span><span class="font6"> Enclosed with this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> you will find a supply of the new schedule with instructions for studying the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font6"> during the coming year. A review of this valuable textbook will be of benefit to all brothers, for all need to be informed and refreshed on the principles set forth therein. Give it good attention and prepare yourself well for the weekly lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be noted that the weekly oral reviews will be conducted by the school servant instead of by each instruction speaker, as previously. All student talks are based on artl-which it deals (have two or three recent copies to illustrate the wide variety of material covered). Thinking people today like to have this magazine come to their home regularly. For the small contribution of $1 you will receive 24 copies, two each month for a year, along with these three booklets. May I write up your subscription?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To an excuse of “too many magazines&quot; you may say: “Even though you may subscribe to many other magazines, only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> directs the mind and heart toward the effective remedy for w<sup>T</sup>orld conditions, namely, God’s kingdom. Foi<sup>-</sup>this we can’t look to man's opinions, for the Bible tells us that ‘wisdom of this world is foolishness with God’. In contrast, the source of God’s Word is likened to ‘great riches’ to be desired by all. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is designed to aid one in gaining the right kind of information, based upon Bible instruction. The contribution for a year’s subscription is only $1.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In event of a subscription refusal, present the latest issue for a five-cent contribution. This will acquaint people with the magazine, increase placements, afford excellent prospects for obtaining subscriptions later, besides laying a foundation for good back-calls and, ultimately, Bible studies.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Analysis of the company’s past “Watchtower” campaign activity will focus attention on the goal for 1953 and what must be done to meet the quota. The discussion-interview below will provide good points to help the company. The demonstration (second below) emphasizes the proper mental attitude on the part of each publisher, with appreciation of “The Watchtower's” importance and need to present offer.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (6 min.) </span><span class="font4">The company committee, determined to make this “Watchtower” campaign the best yet, enthusiastically consider the 15th annual “Watchtower” campaign. By use of the “Informant” file, past copies of “Yearbook” and company records, they delight to note continued increase over the years. The first campaign in 1939 yielded 93,111 subscriptions, to compare with last year’s bountiful harvest of 264,159. Other points of interest are noted, with due credit given to Jehovah’s efficient educational and training organization. Attention is now directed to the local company organization. Past campaigns are considered, with emphasis on last year’s results compared with the country as a whole Did the company make its quota? How many publishers actually obtained one or more subscriptions? A study of the Publisher’s Record cards reveals, generally, that those who regularly engaged in the door-to-door work met or exceeded the quota. However, some cards showing fair hours also show surprisingly low figures for subscriptions. Why? One of committee suggests interviewing publishers who were successful and from them learn what is necessary in addition to spending time in the field to obtain subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (8 min.) </span><span class="font4">Each one of committee selects publisher card and interviews publisher. (Factual interview on basis of card would be best here, if possible.) The following points should be brought out and established in the interviews: 1. Work from door to door and make the full offer at every door. Never get in habit of judging householder and deciding what you think should be offered. 2. Good presentation. Do not wait until at the door to decide what is going to be said. Prepare yourself for effective introduction. 3. Know your offer. Be familiar with contents so points of interest can be shown to householder to gain attention. 4. Proper mental attitude. It is the most important magazine published, a blessing to those righteously disposed. 5. Regularity in field work. Sunday morning door-to-door work supported. Put forth effort by being in field to make offer and Jehovah blesses efforts. 6. Subscription conscious. Back-calls and Bible studies also open up good avenues. Friends, neighbors, relatives often subscribe. 7. Show proper fear of Jehovah. We are his witnesses and prove love by regularly engaging in service. What offer could be better than “The Watchtower” which ‘announces his kingdom’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (4 min.) Committee sums up results of discussion. Agrees if all would have these seven points in mind publishers would be privileged to obtain subscriptions. Publishers encouraged to prepare individually and work closely with local company, support Sunday morning group work and other local activities. Make individual effort to do even better on subscriptions than in recent October “Awake!” campaign. “The Watchtower” is the more important instrument and should therefore receive even more enthusiastic support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (3 min.) Servant calls on Brother Hesitant, who was weak in last year’s “Watchtower” campaign. Hesitant places fair number of books but is low on subscriptions. Brother Hesitant says he can do all right with books, something he can place right on the spot; but to place a year’s subscription is something he just cannot seem to put across unless, perhaps, on a really good Bible study. Servant points out that his trouble is in not presenting the offer; if he did it as with books he would succeed. Also, it was noticed that since Brother Hesitant did not appreciate the “Watchtower” campaign, he neglected house-to-house work these months and engaged in other features of service. Servant says that the service meeting this week will be just the thing Hesitant needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (10 min.) </span><span class="font4">Brother at service meeting gives illustrated talk on “Watchtower” campaign. Shows that marvelous instruments God has given us all play their part, but “The Watchtower” is outstanding. It has served us faithfully without a break for 73 years Where would we be today without it? Being a periodical, its fresh, live material helps us meet the issues that face us every day, current issues. Then speaker recounts some history of “The Watchtower”: Its first issues appeared in July 1879, with circulation of 6,000 copies; then in 1904, 25,000 copies; 1928, 120,000; 1946, 500,000; now 1,500,000 copies of each issue in 36 languages! Enormous jump in circulation in a few years shows how hungry people are for its message. As these figures are discussed, other brothers or sisters (perhaps from small to large in stature) may appear with cards bearing the above-mentioned circulation figures for each period. (Example: size of 1879 card, 2&quot; x 2%&quot;; 1904, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4&quot; x</span><span class="font4"> 5&quot;; 1928, 9&quot; x 11&quot;; 1946, 18&quot; x 22&quot;; 1953, 30&quot; x 38&quot;. At any rate, sheets of paper graduated in size will serve to illustrate circulation growth.) While these cards or sheets are being shown, the speaker can weave in remarks about outstanding truths “The Watchtower” has set forth progressively from 1879: end of “times of the Gentiles”, “millions now living will never die,” “Christ’s enthronement,” “higher powers,” “new name,” “great multitude,” “fill the earth,” “princes,” and the many vital truths of recent months showing us the way of proper living in this wicked world. Purpose of talk will be to show vital need of “The Watchtower” for the millions of people of good will today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (5 min.) Sunday morning Servant calls on Brother Hesitant who remarks how last year he went into campaign with negative, hesitant attitude, but now he is going to prepare, schedule his time for more house-to-house work and go forth with full confidence that this is the work Jehovah directs to be done at this time. Servant gets him off to a good start by taking him along to hear his enthusiastic presentation at first door. After this Brother Hesistant wants to go alone.______________________________</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Change of Address</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">All mail to the Society, both for 117 Adams Street and 124 Columbia Heights, should henceforth show Brooklyn 1, New York. The postal zone number for the Society’s head-quaters at 124 Columbia Heights has been changed to Brooklyn</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Travel to the World Assembly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is very gratifying to see that many circuits, companies and individuals are responding to the privilege previously announced of making donations to the Society for the purpose of bringing to the 1953 world assembly our brothers from foreign lands who otherwise would not be able to attend. Such contributions should be sent to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Treasurer’s Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, N. Y. They should not be included with any other remittance or Good Hopes donation but should be sent by separate check or money order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All persons interested in the New World society are planning so that, if at all possible, they will be in New York July 19 to 26, 1953, for the world assembly. Such persons now prudently begin to save funds for travel to New York. Jehovah blesses the planning efforts of his servants to advance true worship in the earth, and surely individual planning and saving for participation in assemblies of his people meets with his favor. Unquestionably his chosen people of old had to plan, prepare and save to make the annual trips to Jerusalem to participate in theocratic worship. It should be so today in connection with modern assemblies of Jehovah’s people. Do not depend on others to provide for you, nor expect a miracle to make the trip possible. Plan, save and work for the privilege of attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In due course the Society will have suggestions on transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Revisions . . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font6">cuit servants, with the aid and cooperation of the local company servants, should divide the equipment owned by the various circuits in the same manner, or see that proper compensation is made. The circuit servant will have charge of this and will communicate with the various companies involved so that this adjustment will be completed by the time the circuit assemblies resume following the world assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> This new arrangement of the circuit organization is being geared to provide for the needs, not only of the brothers now associated with the organization, but also for the great number of people of good will whose interests were stimulated during the unassigned territory campaign. These persons, as well as others, will need the vital assistance provided them through association with God’s organization. Let each one, then, prayerfully lend himself enthusiastically to this new arrangement, that Jehovah’s name may be magnified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Obtaining subscriptions is an excellent avenue for starting people on the narrow road to life. However, interest we have aroused should be cultivated. Therefore during February we will center our back-call activity on visits to magazine ob-tainers with a view to starting home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Effective back-calls will be made if we are well prepared. Enthusiasm, friendliness, understanding and love lay the foundation for this feature of work. Keeping a personal record of things the good-will person was interested in will aid in making a successful back-call. Magazine deliveries serve as a good means of approach. If a subscription is not obtained, endeavor to leave the latest copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> Thus an opportunity will be provided for a return visit to stimulate the interest. Demonstrate the most effective way of studying the magazine. Home Bible studies may be started by this method.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Servants, pioneers and mature publishers aid irregular and new publishers in the back-call service. Aid everyone you meet to choose life by studying God’s Word with the aid of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> And remember, you meet people by going from house to house!</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> ‘Become holy in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> your conduct.’ (1 Pet. 1:15, Vil<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark28">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark29">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark30">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark31">5</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote6"></a><a href="#bookmark32">6</a></sup>) Thus the apostle Peter counseled Christians not only to have godliness but also to practice it at all times. This includes proper conduct at the meetings of Jehovah’s people. Reports coming to the Society indicate that many of us need to be more considerate of our brothers by exercising a more conscious effort to control noise and confusion at meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Sometimes young children make noise’ which they cannot be held altogether responsible for; but it remains for parents to take steps to prevent these occurrences from causing undue disturbance. Parental discipline, when properly exercised, will minimize this disturbance by children. Young children should be seated w’ith parents at meetings. Attendants should lend tactful assistance in maintaining order and quiet. (See “Questions from Readers”, December 1, 1952, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower;</span><span class="font6"> also July 1952 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> paragraph 3 under “Company Organization”.) However, with some allowances being made for young children, it is inexcusable for those knowing better to engage in unnecessary whispering and noisemaking. This shows lack of respect, denotes inattentiveness and demonstrates lack of consideration for the brothers teaching as well as for others in attendance. Consider the example set by the Israelites on returning from Babylonian captivity. While Ezra was reading, “the ears of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all the people</span><span class="font6"> were attentive unto the book of the law.” (Neh. 8:3) Hearing, understanding and obey</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6"><sup></sup> Not only do we want all brothers associated and persons of good will to attend our meetings, but we also W’ant them to feel welcome and at home. This means we shall have to do more than have an inward love for them, but we should show this outw’ardly. Let us, therefore, be friendly, warm and considerate toward those in attendance. But can we do this if we do not share in welcoming new ones and engaging them in theocratic conversations? Perhaps we have a habit of always sitting in one place in the Kingdom Hall and this contributes to our knowing only a few of our brothers. Try sitting at a different place each time, especially toward the front of the hall, and meet different people before and after meetings. Reserve the rear seats for those coming late. Of course, being on time show’s our consideration, too, so do not be a habitual latecomer. Remember, your company meeting habits will be reflected at circuit and district assemblies.</span></p>

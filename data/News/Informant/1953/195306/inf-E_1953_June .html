<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Completed Plans to Attend?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Carefully Consider Details</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In just a few weeks now the long-anticipated world assembly will be a reality. Will you be there all eight days to share in its blessings to the full? Why not determine now to be among the great crowd of witnesses that will be headed toward New York in July? For many It will be their first international assembly ; and, indeed, for some it will be their very first assembly and meeting with the New World society. Do not overlook inviting goodwill people in your territory. Perhaps they can accompany you. The assembly will be a joy to their hearts, and they will catch the “nirit of unity that pervades the New World society. Let everyone plan to assemble, giving careful consideration to convention details set out below.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> There is still time to obtain rooming accommodations, but we suggest that you write to Watchtower Convention Immediately. The Rooming Department will have accommodations for you, as there will be sufficient for all. The rates in private homes are reasonable. While most of the room assignments will be mailed to publishers, a few may not receive them before they leave home. That need not be a major cause for concern, because upon reaching New York you may go to the Rooming Department at convention headquarters (557 West 157th Street) and get your accommodations. The Rooming Department will function from that address up to and including Friday, July 17. Note, however, that beginning Saturday morning, July 18, the Rooming Department will be located under the bleacher section of Yankee Stadium at the corner of 161st street and River avenue in the Bronx. While you will have a rooming accommodation card, you should write the address of your room in a notebook or on a slip of paper and put it in your wallet; those staying with you should do likewise. Then there will be no question about being able to locate your rooms. You should carry this address during the convention, because it is easy to forget </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> house address. Do not trust your memory. In times past some publishers lost their address and did not know the location of their room, in which was all their luggage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> It is most advisable to arrange for a daylight arrival in New York, and then the first thing you will want to do is to locate your room. If you arrive at an unreasonable hour, that is, between eleven o'clock at night and eight in the morning.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>153,624 Publishers in April Exceeds 20 per cent Peak</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The increase is on I The great crowd is assembling ! There were 131,495 publishers in December! In January, 141,532! In February, 143,004! In March, 149,501! And 153,624 during April! Not by twos, tens or hundreds, but by thousands the other sheep are listening to the Kingdom proclamation and then sharing in the prosperity of God’s people.—Ps. 106: 4,5, .If.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> What a grand crowd, indeed! But have all been assembled? No, for Jehovah commands his witnesses to continue sharing their prosperity, true riches, the knowledge of God's kingdom, with others. Rest as-' sured many more thousands will yet join in worshiping Jehovah in holy array as they are assisted to prosper with God's people. Were you assisted by having books placed with you? Thousands have been, and many more will be helped during June when three books and three booklets will be placed on a $1.50 contribution. Every publisher is invited and encouraged to share in unassigned or regular territory work during June.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> How many sets will you place? Much will depend upon the amount do not try to contact your landlady but wait until after eight in the morning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Pioneers will be given the benefit of the most reasonably priced rooms but should not expect free ones, as all these, if we have any, will be assigned to brothers from foreign countries. If you have received an assignment please accept it, because the householder expects you. In many instances they put themselves out considerably to make your stay comfortable; in fact, sometimes they move out of their own rooms to make space for our delegates. When you receive your assignment, it would be a very nice gesture on your</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) of</span><span class="font4"> time spent in field work. &lt;&nbsp;’an congregation publishers aim for at least one set during the month, and pioneers a minimum of four sets? Try it and work for it. Do not forget to leave tracts where they can supplement your verbal witness. Tracts may also be left with persons of good will who desire to share in passing on prosperous knowledge to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Unassigned Territory Work Begins</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Congregations requesting unassigned territory, as outlined in the Society’s letter of February 15, 1953 (which should be reviewed), have received their assignments. Many have also received back-call slips. Most of these persons will probably have three books from last year. Show them how to study with the Bible and thus reap maximum benefit from the publications and share in the prosperity of God’s people. Encourage them to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> so they will receive Information each week that will prospei- them in the way of life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Groups receiving unassigned territory not worked in 1953 will concentrate on the three-boqk offer. However, no names will be submitted to the Society, but publishers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font4"> 5, co/. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">part to drop a post card or note to the householder, giving the time of your arrival.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> If you have received a hotel accommodation, you should bear in mind that reservations are held only until 6 p.m., unless you definitely advise them that you are coming late, or have made a deposit in advance. For those who have hotel assignments, it would be well to bear in mind that street parking of cars is not permitted in midtown or downtown hotel areas. Garage parking is about $2.00 per night ; and $1.00 to $1.50 per night for leaving your car in a parking lot.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Trailer City</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The trailer and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tent camp is </span><span class="font4">located on the Butterworth and Marks farms on Old New Brunswick road, near New Market, N. J. We suggest that you keep the bottom portion of the trailer and tent form, as it contains detailed instructions on how to get to the camp when traveling toward New York from the south or west; and also how to get from the Trailer City to the stadium. The Society is not expecting to arrange for bus service between the Trailer City and Yankee Stadium. The matter will be handled similar to the way it was in 1950, when ail who wished were able to come in by car groups. It was found that there were always enough cars coming to New York each day to accommodate those desiring to attend sessions at the stadium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> While all the programs from Yankee Stadium will be transmitted by telephone lines to the camp, those staying at the camp will unquestionably want to come to the stadium at least a few times during the week.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Deaf Mutes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> There will be an interpreter for our deaf brothers in the box-seat area of Section 24 in the lower stands.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lost and Found</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Any items that you find can be turned in to the Bost and Found Department. If you lose articles, go to that department for them. If you have been separated from someone in your group, especially children from parents, you should go to the Lost and Found Department and wait at that location. Personal announcements will not be made over the loud-speaker system.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Elderly Persons</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> If elderly publishers and those incapacitated require assistance to and from Yankee Stadium, they should make arrangements with those they know from their local congregation to assist them, rather than expect the convention to provide such aid after they get to New York.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Information</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The Information Department is making plans to assist the brothers in finding their way to and around New Y’ork city. For example, there will be information booths operated by Jehovah’s witnesses and identified by signs reading. “Jehovah’s Witnesses-Convention Information,&quot; on the main highways coming into Holland tunnel and Lincoln tunnel, as well as the routes approaching George Washington bridge. These will be located at prominent filling stations so the brothers will be able to get maps and information as well as gas, which is cheaper in New Jersey than in New York.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> If you are traveling on U.S. Routes 1 and 9, you will find the information booth at the large Esso Servicenter at the traffic light at North avenue in the northern outskirts of Elizabeth, N. J., just before Newark airport. Or, if you are driving on U.S. Route 22, the information booth will be located at the Atlantic service station in Hillside, N. J., just after you pass the Bristol-Myers factory. It is approximately ten miles from the Holland tunnel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> If you use N. J. Route 3, the information booth will he at the same Thompson’s Esso Servicenter as in 1950, located 1.8 miles after the junction with N. J. Route 20. You will see a large Sign on the station saying, “Last Esso Station Before New Jersey Turnpike, Interchange 17.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">14 There are three main routes leading to the George Washington bridge. If you use U.S. Route 46, the Sunoco service station two miles past the last exit to the New Jersey turnpike and two miles from the bridge in Fort Lee, N. J„ will give you information. You can identify it by the huge Sunoco billboard sign above it. If you come in on N. J. Route 4. you will see a large Shell service station about two miles before the bridge. It is called “Fort Lee Shell”. Many coming from the north will use Route 9-W, and the information booth will be at the same Rustic Cabin Esso station in Englewood Cliffs, N. J., as in 1950, two miles before the bridge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> If you are traveling by bus, train or airplane, you will find information booths at the Greyhound, Pennsylvania and Grand Central stations; also at Newark, LaGuardia and Idlewild airports.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> In the event your rooming assignment card shows a Brooklyn address, and you are coming in on U.S. Routes 1, 9 or 22, take the Holland tunnel; cross Manhattan</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font4">and take the Brooklyn or Manhattan bridge. If your card shows a New York city address, such as Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Maspeth, Elmhurst. East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona, Forest Hills, College Point, Whitestone, Flushing, Broadway, Kew Gardens, Jamaica, Richmond Hill. Hillside, Hollis. St. Albans, Springfield, or Laurelton, it will save time to come into New York via the Lincoln tunnel on N. J. Route 3. Then cross Manhattan and take either Queens-Midtown tunnel or Queensboro bridge to reach your destination.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> When the postal zone number with a New York address is 14 or under, it would be best to come in through the Holland tunnel. If between 15 and 29, the Lincoln tunnel would be most convenient.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> If your rooming assignment card shows New Y’ork zones from 30 and up, and you are coming from the west, it would be to your advantage to come in via the George Washington bridge.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Thousands of territories are being made up so all can share In field service. Remember, everyone should be a publisher in July. Territory will be available not only at Y’ankee Stadium but also at Kingdom Halls throughout the city. To determine the contact point (Kingdom Hall) nearest your room, look on your room assignment card and you will notice a territory number that is preceded by two letters. The letters indicate the location of the contact point nearest you. For convenience, all contact points are listed below.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> We are all familiar with how much work is required for the success of the many departments at the convention. Many volunteers will be needed, so we would suggest that all brothers who have not as yet filled out an Application for Volunteer Service form do so and mail it to the convention headquarters. If you have volunteered for cafeteria or maintenance work, it would be well to bring appropriate clothing. A number of craftsmen, such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tinsmiths, etc., will be needed during the week just prior to the assembly. If you are able and willing to come in ahead of time, please note such information on your Application for Volunteer Service form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Music</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> A small orchestra is being planned and those who are experienced and capable musicians, and who wish to share, should also mail in Application for Volunteer Service forms. Obviously you will need to bring your instruments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> All those planning to be immersed should be prepared by bringing bathing suits and towels.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">First Aid</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Please take note of the fact that chronic ailments will not be treated at the First Aid Department. This department is set up for the immediate aid of those </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">requiring first aid</span><span class="font4"> due to an injury, accident or some condition that needs immediate care. Space is too limited to establish a hospital.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mail</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">24 There will be no bulletin board with its generally ungainly appearance. Instead, for your convenience, there will be a post office where you can leave notes or mail for others. If you expect notes from anyone you should call at the post office. You will be able to procure stamps at the post office. If you expect to receive mail from friends at home, please use your personal room address rather than have your mail sent to the stadium. In fact, it would be well to leave your personal New York room address with someone at home in the event an emergency requires immediate contact with you. Contact with you at your room address will be much more satisfactory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Toilet Facilities</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> While Yankee Stadium has increased its toilet facilities, they are still limited. If you are traveling to the stadium by subway, it may be advisable to use the subway public toilets before entering the stadium.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Photography</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Official pictures will be taken by the Photography Department and no one else will be permitted to take pictures on the field. It will be all right to take pictures from the stands, however.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Recording Machines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Thousands have made request to bring recorders to the assembly. Since adequate facilities are not available, the convention has made another arrangement as an accommodation to the brothers. Tapes will be made of certain portiops of the sessions, each tape containing a two-hour program. All tapes will be of high quality with the program being recorded at 3} inches per second. The cost of these tapes recorded will be $4.50 each, which is approximately $1.00 less than retail price for good plastic tapes. Handling it in this manner will mean better recordings for all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The convention program will list the different sessions of the convention that will be recorded. When you arrive at the convention, select the tapes you want and place your order (accompanied by remittance) with the Public Address Department, the location of which will be shown on the program. Tapes may </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> be ordered by mail. If you will not be at the convention and yet desire tapes, you must arrange for someone else to procure the tapes for you. Those staying in the trailer city may place their orders at the Public Address Department there. The tapes will be available one or two days after the program presentation. You may also pick up tapes on Monday, July 27, at the convention tents. Then if you have not obtained all your tapes before you leave New York, they will be mailed to your address (within the United States).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> No wire recordings will be made: they will have to be obtained by individual publishers from someone who has tapes of the different sessions. Do not bring your own recorders or tapes. This will answer the inquiries of those who have written to the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Those who have sound cars should write to the convention office informing them what equipment they have and whether it is in good condition. You will lie notified if your sound car is needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Transportation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> If you are traveling by rail, you should make your reservations</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">3 </span><span class="font4">immediately! Travel is going to be heavy throughout the United States this summer. In the event you are traveling by bus, automobile or airplane your plans should be pretty well complete by now.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Careful planning and forethought will mean a much more enjoyable convention for you. Consideration for others will show love for your brothers. Patience, kindness and diligent attention given to the convention program will reflect your desire to conform to the righteous requirements of the New World society. You want to enjoy the convention to the full: but help others to enjoy it too. Help make this assembly a tremendous shout to Jehovah’s praise by everything you do while in New York city. (Take this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> with you to New York so that you will have all the necessary details.)</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Car Signs Available</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Those traveling by automobile will be interested in knowing that the Society is making signs that can be used on the back of cars en route to New York. The sign will be approximately 44&quot; x 20&quot; in size, attractively designed with fluorescent colors and will provide identification and advertising while traveling. All that is necessary to apply the sign is to remove the protective paper on the back and stick it on any </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">clean </span><span class="font4">surface, such as the bumper or rear window. It will not harm these surfaces. The adhesive is latex material that will readily stick to irreguar areas. If desired, the sign may be applied to a board and fastened to the bumper. These signs will be available for ten cents each and should be considered as cash items. As soon as this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> is received, the congregation servants may order the quantity needed from the Society at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn 1, N. Y. All orders must be in not later than June 10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Legal Notice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">All men released on bond in draft cases who are planning to come to the convention cannot leave their district without consent of the federal judge. The government may forfeit the bond of any man who leaves without permission. This means that the bondsmen will have to pay the full amount of the bond. All expecting to make the trip to New York in July should obtain permission from the federal judge before leaving. The request may be made to the judge in writing, by telephone or in person.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The world assembly at New York is in view I In a matter of a few short weeks Jehovah's servants from all parts of the earth will be assembling. It is right and good that we do so, for it is God’s command. (Heb. 10:25) Will you be there as a publisher of good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During July the offer will continue to be three bound books with three booklets on a contribution of $1.50. For most publishers there will be two full weeks at home before leaving for the assembly. Will you get out in the service and report as a publisher in July even before you start for New York? Being convention-minded should stimulate, not deter, Jehovah’s servants in working toward continued progress and increase. If you have been helping good-will persons in the service, help them to get out before the convention, and see that they report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> En route to New York, by car, plane, train or bus, there will be many opportunities for incidental preaching. Take some literature with you, especially magazines and tracts, so that you can preach the good news and leave something with people whom you meet. Keep an accurate record of all this time (10 minutes here, 15 minutes there) so that you can report it for July.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Brooklyn Bethel Vacation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Society's offices, factory and Bethel home in Brooklyn will be closed from July 31 to August 10 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> the annual vacation. The Bethel family will also be occupied with assembly matters from July 19 to 26, although the home and factory will be open for four days following the convention, July 27 to 30, for inspection by visitors. This means that, in the period from July 19 through August 10, very little mail will be handled and few orders will be shipped. Moreover, there will be an unavoidable delay of several weeks after August 10 due to accumulation of mail. Anticipate your literature and' handbill needs now and place your orders immediately.</span></p>

If for some reason you will not be home by the end of July, mail your reports to that person. If the congregation servant thinks he should wait until the 10th of August to collect all the July reports, that will be all right, because the Brooklyn office will be closed until then. But if you hold it open that long in order for the conventioners to return and make out their reports, please send your July report by air mail. Brothers from countries outside the United States will air-mail their July reports back home. Let everyone be a publisher in July, without fail.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">The 1953 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign was an outstanding success. United States publishers reported 92,165 more subscriptions this year than in 1952, or a total of 356,324. The fact that approximately the same number of subscriptions was obtained in each of the four months of the campaign indicates that publishers were out in the field regularly each month. Keep up the good work by continuing as a regular publisher. Bear in mind, too, that if you are alert to present the magazines where interest is manifested, many subscriptions can be obtained for both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> throughout the year.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Order Convention Badges Immediately</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Every conventioner can share in the assembly advertising by using one of the neat celluloid badges being prepared. The badges announce the convention, identify the delegate and invite people to hear the public lecture. They may be worn by all conventioners from the time they leave home until the convention is over. People along the way may ask about the convention and so a good witness will result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> On the colorful card inserts space is provided to type or print the name of the person and the congregation represented. American delegates will show the city and state. Others will give city and province or country. The typing or printing should be done neatly under supervision of the congregation servant. If there is a good penman in the congregation, he should be called upon to do the printing. Keep in mind that neatness will add to the convention advertising. By each delegate’s showing w’here he is from, all should become acquainted more quickly and be enabled to meet delegates </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font4"> various countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The badges will cost five cents each. Full remittance must be sent with all orders. Congregations should order immediately for all convention delegates that want this badge. Get the orders in by June 15 at the latest. Delegates from overseas will be able to obtain badges at Yankee Stadium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The Society is not going to stock these items for future assemblies. They are special for this year. But they may be useful later on at other meetings, so we suggest that all publishers retain the badges after the convention. Order now.</span></p></li></ul>

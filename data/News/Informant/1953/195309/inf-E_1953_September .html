<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The world today is like a vast prison camp. Enslaved to the old-world system and Its many forms of evil and corruption are the majority of the inhabitants. How can those who are honest and love righteousness be set free from such enslavement and have the glorious freedom that is the portiop of the children of God? (Rom. 8: 21, .VW) To the many who are within this group of those who groan, yes, sigh and cry, we, as God’s children and servants, can offer the means to gain freedom. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> By means of the enlightening truth found expressed so simply and forcibly in the A’em </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> and as presented in any one of the excellent Bible study aid books published by the Society, we can do the greatest amount of freeing. September's offer will be this Bible and a book, for a $2 contribution. And how can we best find the ones who are seeking for the truth that sets one free? By going from house to house, of course. Here is where the sheeplike ones can most readily be found, fed and freed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> We all know that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Xeic World Translation</span><span class="font5"> is the best there is. We have studied it carefully, know how good its renditions are, and are aware of the valuable contents it has for its possessor. We appreciate more fully what it has done for us and, with that knowledge in mind, it is going to be an easy matter for us to present it in a very convincing and effective manner. .Just tell people in your own words how much it has meant to you, how you have benefited from its pages, the joy, satisfaction and comfort you have derived from studying and reading it. A few appropriate texts can be selected and read to the person to give him a sample of its clarity, simplicity and forceful expression.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Persons with whom we are studying the Bible, or whom we are calling back upon, are good prospects for the combination. Why not present it to them “immediately? They need it to make progress toward liberty and find the way to freedom. But, after that is accomplished, what about a larger field in which to sow this life-giving message? Yes, the house-to-house work is the place meant. Here is where the “sheep&quot; are to be found; here is where the prisoners can be contacted in great numbers; here is where we are able to locate those who sigh and cry for the wicked abominations that are done in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Servant Schedule</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greater Emphasis on</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>House-to-House Ministry</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> With thankful hearts we received the good news at Yankee Stadium that the circuit servants would be spending more time in the training of publishers for effective house-to-house preaching. As of September 1, 1953, the new arrangement will go into effect and it is hoped that the entire organization for spreading the glorious Kingdom message will move forward in closer co-operation and with greater effectiveness in the field. It is geared to provide more personal training in the ministry for servants, pioneers and congregation publishers, with a view to their being better ministers and representatives of the New World society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The circuit servant’s schedule is a full one and will require planning and co-operation by everyone in the congregation. All publishers should regard his visit as a grand opportunity to receive personal Instruction and training, and they should therefore organize their personal affairs to devote as much time as possible to field service during that week. On Tuesday afternoon the circuit servant will check the recland and who long for real freedom of the truth and its enlightening, encouraging and uplifting message. Here, at the doors, will be found the ideal place to lay the groundwork for good back-calls and Bible studies. Truly, there is no substitute for the house-to-house work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> We ourselves have been freed. We want to stay free. So we want to express our appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions, our gratefulness for the freedom we enjoy, by working to help others find this same delightful freedom and the joy, happiness and blessings that come with it. Why not have an increased share of this by helping prisoners to secure freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ords of the congregation to become familiar with its needs, having in mind particularly the publishers who require assistance and also the publishers who are qualified to be used as teachers. That evening he will meet with all pioneers to discuss their ministry and how it might be improved, and also to ascertain who among them will make good teachers. He will want to see the pioneer daily record sheets for the past year. After this will come the service meeting and school, as usual in the congregation, followed by counsel on the part of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> From Wednesday to Friday house-to-house witnessing will be arranged, both mornings and afternoons. The circuit servant will train publishers to give an effective witness and make a good presentation of the literature, also to make back-calls and conduct Bible studies. He will particularly train servants and other mature publishers so that they will be prepared to continue instruction of less mature and new publishers after he is gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> A congregation book study will be scheduled for Wednesday night, and others for Thursday and Friday where there are more than one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Baptizing Them’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them,’’ said Jesus; and he promised that he would back up and support such activity on the part of his followers. (Matt. 28: 19, NW) The “Yearbook” shows that this baptizing work is being done in all nations, the world over. In the Far East, for example. (132) In Latin America. (135) In the islands of the sea. (87) AU of this marks a transformation in the lives of people, for it means they set out upon a new pattern of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While individual congregations sometimes hold their own baptismal services, assemblies of Jehovah’s people Srovide splendid occasions for a public eclaration of one’s dedication. (151, 269) Sometimes it is the circuit servant himself who assists, either by giving the baptismal talk or actually doing the immersing. (178, 221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports show, too, that a person does not necessarily have to study for a year or longer to see and appreciate the need for baptism. In the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan new publishers are baptized after three months of study. (209) In Colombia it is the same. (134)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even ancient customs that allow women little freedom do not now prevent baptism on the part of new sisters. (208) Persons baptized often need continued help to keep in service regularly until they are spiritually strong and able to stand on their own feet, as shown by the report from Finland. (159, 160) Does the increase in your congregation produce candidates for baptism from time to time? Do not fail to help new ones appreciate this important step and understand what it means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theocratic Tactfulness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves” was part of the instruction Jesus gave to his twelve disciples. (Matt. 10: 16, NW) There are all kinds of situations encountered in preaching the good news that require tact. At times it is the tactful reply that will close the mouths of those who cause us trouble, as shown by the report from Greece. (176) Again, what sometimes appears at first to be a closed mind may be opened by skillful use of tact. (114)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witnessing in some parts of the world is very difficult because of the strong hold of false religion upon the people. Such circumstances require perseverance, consideration of the living and thinking habits of the people, and use of tact. Have you had to work under conditions similar to those our brothers cope with' in Eire? (119, 120)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perhaps you have come across homes where servants always answer your knock. In Hong Kong the brothers have a rather novel way of overcoming the servant barrier, appealing to the curiosity of the householder himself. Perhaps it would work at times for you. (187)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When working in a strongly religious community where you meet with a constant barrage of sharp answers, do you try changing your tactics in order to achieve better results? See how the brothers in Finland were successful in this at one home. (159)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To know when to speak and when not to speak, what to say and what not to say, requires keen mental perception. We can learn much from the experiences of our brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Why do you prefer the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures?</span><span class="font5"> Would you recommend that others obtain a copy of this Bible and use it for their personal study? Undoubtedly, all of Jehovah’s servants will unanimously agree that everyone seeking an accurate knowledge of the Bible and the way that leads to life should have a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> To people who ask why they should get a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> when they have their own Bible, we may tactfully reply as follows: “Since the time of the 14th century many English translations of the inspired writings of Christ’s disciples have been made. All of these have their own commendable features. Much good has been accomplished by them and yet will be. At the present, however, there is a growing demand for a more accurate and up-to-date Bible translation. Many prominent Bible scholars, educators, newspapers and magazines have publicly lauded the improvement of the more recent translations in comparison with old English ones. Bible scholars also agree on the fact that while both old and new English translations have their points of merit, often they have fallen victim to bias and preferred religious views, and human traditions have been interwoven into them. Christ Jesus taught that the traditions of creed-bound men make the commandments and teachings of God of no power and effect. (Matt. 15:6, A'W) Although improved translations are available, they are not easily obtained due to the fact that they are very expensive and thus beyond the reach of the average person’s income.

<p><span class="font5">Magazine house-to-house work maybe arranged before the study, and after the study the circuit servant will talk to the group for about 15 minutes. Saturday morning and afternoon will be devoted to store-to-store and house-to-house work with magazines.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> “Also, we know that the original Bible was written in the living language of the people of that day, Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. Many of our older Bible translations are written in an old-style English that we no longer speak today. This greatly increases the difficulty in understanding the Bible. On' the other hand, the translators of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> have provided a translation for the spiritual instruction of others and, therefore, have rendered it in language that you and I use every day. To show you what I mean let's compare your Bible with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> on the Scripture passages at James 1:6 and 2 Timothy 3:1-5. There are many other wonderful features, but I suggest that you find them out for yourself byaccepting this Bible and book on a very- reasonable contribution of $2.&quot;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> If some inquire about the advantages of having a personal copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> we can enthusiastically inform them that the translation is based on the most ancient and reliable manuscripts available. Also, it has the advantages of the latest scholarship and research on ancient languages. The Bible also features marginal references and footnotes, and a system of tracing outstanding Bible subjects from Matthew to Revelation. The appendix is also noteworthy and reference should be made to the maps and illustrations.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font8"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first demonstration below will help publishers present the Bible and book combination in September, giving an effective short talk at the doors. The second demonstration deals with maturity and the necessity for publishers to be regular in house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (6 min.) Publisher introduces himself to householder and presents “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures” and book offer. However, householder remarks that he has a Bible and has tried to read it, but could not understand what he read and would therefore hardly be interested in obtaining anything else. Publisher immediately sees opportunity to show outstanding value of &quot;New World Translation” and book as an aid to this person. He tells householder that his remark about not understanding the Bible reminds him of similar incident in the Bible where a God-fearing person expressed the same thing in substance, and how Jehovah caused a servant of his to meet this person and aid him in getting a proper understanding of the Bible. By this time the publisher has opened a copy of the “New World Translation” and begins to read the account in Acts 8: 26-35 concerning Philip’s aiding the Ethiopian eunuch in understanding the prophecy of Isaiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publisher shows similarity of work of God’s servants at this time and how the ''New World Translation” and book are aids toward getting a clear and correct understanding of God’s purposes. To illustrate he reads 2 Peter 3: 5-7 (NW) and then shows briefly how chapter XXI in “Let God Be True” will help in understanding. Householder appreciates point of illustration and is anxious to contribute for Bible and book combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE li (6 min.) Publisher presents “New World Translation” and book offer to householder, whereupon householder says he has his own Bible, the “King James Version.” Publisher points out that the “King James Version” was written in 1611 in the archaic English of Shakespeare’s day. He asks householder if he finds it much easier to read and understand his daily newspaper than one of Shakespeare’s plays in Old English with its “thees,” “thous,” “thys,” and words such as “forbear,” “curst,” “giveth,” etc A comparision of the text at Matthew 5: 22 in the “King James Version” with that of the “New World Translation” is suggested by the publisher. He points out the clarity of expression and meaning in the “New World Translation” and then shows how footnote at bottom of page aids in better understanding the text. Through the footnote an additional feature, the appendix, can be evaluated by its information on the word “Gehenna,” page 766.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publisher gives short talk on Revelation 21: 1-4 and ties it in with “Let God Be True”, chapter XXII He briefly shows scope of book and explains how it compares Scripture texts and helps in understanding. Householder agrees to take offer for $2 contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (3 min.) Summary by conductor to emphasize presenting the offer at every door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (10 min.) Conductor emphasizes the need for each publisher to display maturity by being a regular house-to-house publisher during the new service year. Many have failed in the past year and may need assistance in this year from the regular publishers who have overcome their problems. All can become regular publishers through the proper approach to the problem Irregular publisher in audience raises his hand and objects, “But brother how can I be a regular publisher when my secular work keeps me busy until late every day and Sunday is my only day with my family?” The question is referred to the audience and they offer such suggestions as, “Take your family with you in the service on Sunday. If they do not believe, then you will set the proper example before them by going in service yourself, and your example of faithfulness and regular worship may assist them. When we were going to church we went regularly each Sunday, or at least once or twice a month; so we should be able to spend the same time or more in proper worship Perhaps you can locate a different job so you can have more free time, etc.” Brother expresses thanks for suggestions and says he will try to do better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sister raises her hand and says, “I have four children and an unbelieving husband, so I find it almost impossible to get out.” Audience responds. “The sisters meet during the week; you could work with them, taking one or two children with you while the others are in school; a sister offers to stay with the very young children while she goes in service during week; perhaps husband will care for children; must be example of devotion to Jehovah, as serving him means eternal life for children as well as you; no greater heritage for children than ministry, etc.” (“Watchtower,” 1/15/52)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A third irregular publisher raises his hand and says, “I put in a few hours for four months, but the other months, I don’t know why, but I just didn’t do any service. Can you help me?” Audience responds- “Arrange a schedule of service and study and keep it, setting aside specific times to engage in service. Attend congregation book studies and work with group. Brother from his area offers to assist by calling and taking him along in his territory, etc.” All are thankful for assistance. Other practical suggestions may be offered to assist the ones suffering from irregularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (5 min.) Conductor sums up the information gained from discussing the problems of three irregular publishers, pointing out how we must evaluate properly our dedication to Jehovah in relation to our secular occupations and other problems. He notes that the ones who work closely with the organization, lean on Jehovah for his spirit’s guidance and study Jehovah’s Word regularly at home and at the meetings are the ones who are spiritually healthy, mature, regular publishers. Close co-operation between the regular and irregular ones makes the congregation stronger. Real diligent effort must be put forth by all, but each one’s being a regular house-to-house publisher in the new service year will bring blessings of expansion to the organization and maturity to its members.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> To awake from sleep into the brilliant light of day is quite an experience. When Jehovah gives the command to cease sleeping, his children vigorously respond by rising to a condition of energetic activity in the light of his Word. (Eph. 5:14, ,V W) Behind are the heavy slumber-ings and dreams of old-world vanities and ahead are the prospects of new-world blessings. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine helps to rouse persons from slumbering indifference to a keen realization and appreciation that a new day has dawned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Never before has the command to awake been more appropriate and demanding than now, when thousands sleep unaware that Christ Jesus, the new world's King, is ruling in the midst of his enemies. Last October, 107,394 new subscribers were given the opportunity to observe the flashing beams of light from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine’s beacon of truth-filled pages. Will you be ready to give many more the same opportunity this October? You will be, if you prepare in advance, keeping in mind that you must be awake to present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> to the sleeping world.—Rom. 13:11.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">circuit servant. Circuit servants will notify the congregation servant in advance when the district servant will accompany him for a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The week of tile circuit servant's visit will be a busy but profitable and joyful one. Jehovah’s servants realize that they have the most important work on earth to do, and they want to know how to do it best. Hence they will look forward to the circuit servant’s visit, share in its benefits to the full, and then continue to apply what they have learned in ‘thoroughly accomplishing the ministry.’</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>House-to-House Ministry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Every publisher a regular house-to-house preacher of good news!” has been the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> slogan. The goal of every congregation should be to have everyone a well-qualified minister, able to effectively preach the good news from house to house, present the offer, make return visits and start and conduct Bible studies. With congregation activity properly organized, all publishers who love Jehovah and sincerely desire to have a part in the great work he Is directing can and will be assisted to become regular in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Reports show that approximately 72 per cent of all Kingdom publishers in the United States share to some extent in this basic part of the witness w’ork. A good number are mature ministers, able to go alone and to train others, while some have not yet matured to the point of witnessing alone at the door; and approximately 42,000 never engage in house-to-house preaching. This means that considerable training work must be done. All qualified servants, pioneers and mature publishers, as called to our attention at the world assembly, should have in mind training others to become active and effective in the house-to-house ministry.—Acts 20: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Congregation servants should know the teaching abilities of mature publishers, and also those who need house-to-house training. Under the congregation servant’s direction book study conductors will assign mature publishers qualified to teach to train one or more new or less mature publishers. Individuals privileged to have a part in this training work should assist the assigned publishers as often as possible until they are able to witness alone scription slips. Three booklets will be given free with each year's subscription. Publishers will remit 90 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> You ‘shepherds of the flock,’ see to it that effective presentations are featured on the service meetings, and definite arrangements are made to assist all needy ones to share in the blessings of this featured activity. This can be the greatest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">campaign ever, as Jehovah continues to prosper his organization and many more share in awakening the sleepers.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark27"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">and, in turn, teach others. Put this arrangement into operation right away. When your circuit servant visits, he will work with publishers, offer appropriate counsel and instruction to servants and publishers carrying out the training work and also personally assist as many as possible of those being trained. He will see to it that your organization for training is functioning effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Definite time should be set aside for the house-to-house ministry. Every Sunday morning all publishers are encouraged to be at the contact point by 9: 30 and to spend a minimum of two hours presenting the offer from house-to-house. Many can be trained during this period; and, after presenting the offer for two hours, they can be taught to make back-calls. Activity for group work and individuals assigned </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font5">work together should be arranged during the week. Congregation book study conductors will want to schedule house-to-house magazine work before the book study and take the lead then, as well as on Sunday and on back-call night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> When starting new publishers, why not train them in the house-to-house ministry at the outset? House-to-house Magazine Day activity, after only a little training, affords an excellent opportunity for new publishers and ones being trained to present the offer. Continue to work with them regularly and guide them to become mature ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> With servants, pioneers and mature publishers co-operating in this training, and with the ones being assisted taking advantage of this loving provision to advance their ministry, every Kingdom publisher will soon be a regular house-to-house minister of the good news. —1 Tim. 4 : 15,16, .VW.</span></p>

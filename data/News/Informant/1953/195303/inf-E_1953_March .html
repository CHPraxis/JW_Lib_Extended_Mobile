<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Yes, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we reached and surpassed our 10 per cent quota in January. Not since April of 1951 had we hit an all-time peak. And now, in a winter month, despite much sickness throughout the country, we are off to a splendid start toward our goal of 150,000 publishers before the world assembly in July. Some companies actually achieved a 50 percent increase in January. What will your company do in March? Will you be able to report “We made it I” for the 20 per cent peak by the end of April ?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Another heart-cheering fact is that January was the best single month in any </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoirer</span><span class="font3"> campaign to date.

<p><span class="font3">The summer months of June. July and August will again afford opportunity for publishers to work in unassigned territory to some extent at least. We feel that a great deal can be accomplished in view of the letters and literature the Society sent into these areas following last summer’s work. Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> you will find a letterdealing with the unassigned territory activity for 1953, along with an application form and a list of counties not. worked at all last year. In most instances companies will wish to go back to the territories they visited last year, and we urge them to do this wherever possible. The follow-up work will be most profitable, as reported by brothers who are already doing some of this work. Give the matter careful consideration and send us your Application for Unassigned Territory on or before April 1, 1953. marvelous increase is that Jehovah is blessing the efforts of the brothers everywhere to get out in the field and preach the good news from house </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> house. You must meet people to talk the truth to them, and you must meet people to place subscriptions. So kt ep right on meeting people by regularly working from house to house. If you did it during January, there is more reason to do it during March and April! Let everyone keep his eye fixed on 150,000 publishers before convention!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> God’s flock is clean and everyone who remains part of this flock must keep clean in his worship.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Each year at Memorial time we take special note of our great privilege of worshiping the Sovereign Jehovah. We are moved to review our dedication responsibilities, the wonderful and yet serious position we occupy as devoted preachers of the good news. We are moved to “worship Jehovah in holy- array” with renewed vigor and apply ourselves to thoroughly accomplish our ministry. There could be no more grand and glorious opportunity-bestowed upon us now. Do you fully appreeiate it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Do you see that there is now the possibility of making 1953 an outstanding year for worship of the true God? The world assembly will do much in this regard, but we add emphasis to it by diligent efforts in the field. It would be a wonderful</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font2">Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bible studies generally lead to dedication, baptism and a new publisher of good news. (Acts 8: 26-40, NW) While most frequently conducted in homes, it is possible to conduct them in many different places and under unusual circumstances, if publishers are alert to start studies. Consider the 1953 “Yearbook” report on Korea for an example. (83) Lack of space often requires the conducting of five studies simultaneously at the Kingdom Hall in Hong Kong. (187) Do you have such a handicap to overcome? Studies can be conducted with all kinds of people, as in Portugal. (85)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How do people of good will react to theocratic instruction at the home Bible study? Consider the report on the Bahamas (103), and the report from China (133), and the one from Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan. (208) See what one new publisher in Japan is doing. (202) In Peru home studies in “The Watchtower” produce good results. (244) And some publishers use tracts to start studies. (245)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you have the obstacles that the brothers in China must overcome in order to conduct home Bible studies? (131) What would you do if you had to produce your own books in order to start studies? What are you doing now with the splendid books you have? Does your zeal measure up to that of your brothers in China?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Check this issue of the “Informant” and see what the U. S. national average is for home Bible studies. Is your company keeping pace with it? Are you making progress toward maturity by striving to do better in this respect? Consider the “Yearbook” report from Hawaii. (182)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 1953 public meeting series starts on March 29. Has your company made plans to have a full share in public meetings this year? If you do not plan for public meetings every month, you will be missing a blessing in advancing Kingdom interests, as illustrated by many reports in the “Yearbook”. In Argentina the number of new persons at public talks (most of these in private homes) always exceeds the number of publishers present, despite the fact that only private invitations are given. (91) In Jamaica the results are very good too. (200) Fifteen publishers counted 500 at a public meeting in the Philippine Republic. (247) Brothers in Costa Rica and Bolivia experience splendid results with public meetings, notwithstanding inconveniences and bad weather. (138, 109)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public lectures can be given in many places, often under unusual circumstances, if the effort is put forth to arrange for them. In Austria a kitchen was used. (100) Some brothers in the British Isles used the vestry of a chapel with success. (118) In Cuba the national prison was used for a talk, as well as a theater and park. (139) One public talk in Chile went out over the city public address system throughout the town. (129, 130) Jesus talked by the seashore, and our brothers in Newfoundland use the wharves to deliver public lectures as they visit coastal towns by boat. (219)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reports from the Gold Coast and British West Indies demonstrate how good-will persons will often help in advertising a public talk if given the opportunity. (122, 172) Are you sometimes discouraged by having only a few persons attend your public talk? Consider the work of the brothers in Israel. (80) Keep up the good work with public meetings! Let every company share!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>By Helping Obtainers of Individual Magazines to Subscribe</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At one time you called on these people, perhaps on Magazine Day. You told them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is a journal that will help them get answers to Bible questions and understand the reason for world distress; that it will give them hope for the future. They took an individual copy, and you had in mind </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> return visit. Time has passed and you are ready to call back. A subscription is what you want, but how will you start, and what will you say? Perhaps something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Mr. Smith? Good evening, sir. You will recall that I left a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> with you a short time ago. I would very much like to have your opinion of the journal.” (Person may say he did not read it, or that he read some and magazine is good. Having previously selected an article of general interest, you proceed.) “You know, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> always contains helpful information. Take, for instance, this January 15 issue (page 39). It gives splendid counsel to married persons, saying: ‘Because of difference in mental, physical and emotional make-up, each needs the other, each can supply a lack in the other, each is made to be a complement to or counterpart for the other. But to mesh all these qualities harmoniously requires</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(Part 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All remittances for literature, magazines, supplies, etc., should be made payable to Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. Inc. (exactly as written here) and should be sent to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">117</span><span class="font3"> Adams Street, Brooklyn 1, N. Y. Remittances not made payable to the Society must be endorsed by the original payee. Figures and written amounts on checks often do not agree, so they should be carefully compared by the company servant. The company servant should also see to it that the necessary signature or signatures are on each check; otherwise the check must be returned. When a check is written, be sure there are sufficient funds in the bank to cover it. Frequently checks are returned to the Society because of insufficient funds in the company bank account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">each one to play the role assigned by God. Neither can grasp at the other’s duties.' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then you relate how the magazine deals with Ephesians chapter 5, which gives some of God's requirements for husband and wife. This is certainly practical for everyday living, because it helps make a success of marriage, which brings joy. And you call attention to the cheerful note on which the article ends, pointing out new world opportunities now before every married couple. This is just one of the many good articles appearing in every issue. Missing one copy is like missing a tasty meal. “We have an arrangement whereby you can receive the magazine regularly by mail, and the cost is only $1 for an entire year. I would be very happy to take your subscription and give you these three booklets free. In all the world there is no dollar investment that will bring you more pleasure or greater lasting value.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Emphasize the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription : however, both subscriptions may be offered. If you have not kept a record of obtainers of individual magazines, do so in March and follow through in April. These people are acquainted with tiie journals and provide good prospects for subscriptions. Be prepared to discuss one or two good articles when you call. You will thus aid many to begin to “worship Jehovah in holy array”.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">Home Bible studies can be conducted in “The Watchtower”, or “The Watchtower” can be used as a steppingstone to a Bible study, as illustrated in the first demonstration below. The second demonstration provides a review of procedure for obtaining subscription renewals and for following through on expiration slips forwarded by the Society.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Starting Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE 1 (3 min.) Conductor discusses importance of home Bible studies. Many studies can be started by making return visits on “Watchtower” subscribers; or, “The Watchtower” can be used as a stepping-, stone to lead into a study of “Let God Be True”, in order to consider the basic doctrines in a simple and easily understood way. How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (9 min.) Publisher and servant who made last call, as outlined in February “Informant” demonstration, are seen making return visit upon householder who subscribed. After friendly greeting and brief discussion of day’s events, conversation turns to more weighty matters. Servant points to physical facts in evidence that fulfill Bible prophecy. Using February 1, 1953, “Watchtower” (asking householder to get his copy), he turns to article &quot;Deliverance to a Righteous World”. After asking question and briefly commenting, first paragraph is read. Attention is called to clear and direct way question is answered; also to scripture text, which publisher quickly locates and reads. Householder is asked how that sounded, and he indicates approval. Servant then reads next question and asks for householder’s thoughts. He ventures quiet and hesitant comment, while disclaiming any real knowledge. At servant’s suggestion he reads paragraph. Servant and publisher are friendly to householder and encourage him, though he is a bit embarrassed by his rather poor reading. Servant tactfully assures him it is well done and encourages further participation. This time better response is noted from householder. Another paragraph or two are considered, with publisher, servant and householder taking turns at reading paragraphs and scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fifth sentence in paragraph seven prompts householder to ask a question about the end of the world. Servant replies briefly and then takes from his case study copies of “Let God Be True”, turning to the chapter on “The End of the World”. He points out that many persons have asked the same question and then asks householder to read first paragraph. He exclaims that this is just what he wants to know. The question on paragraph two is read, and householder is really engrossed by answer and comments on paragraph. Seeing householder’s keen interest in subject, servant continues study in book as several more paragraphs are considered. When hour is up, publishers prepare to go, after arranging to continue discussion next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Conductor summarizes, pointing out that transition need not wait for householder to raise question. Publisher can inject “Let God Be True” and introduce book at any appropriate point. You have placed “Watchtower” subscription and will want to deal with that when you make first return visits. But if, after a discussion or two, it appears desirable to take up basic principles, a regular study in “Let God Be True” or any other book can be started as outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Bible study servant in discourse points out that many “Watchtower” and “Awake!” subscribers fail to renew each year. We should try to obtain renewals from as many of these people as possible. The proper time to renew is while the subscription is still active; hence Society encourages Bible study servant to use Subscription Record Sheet (S-10) and, one month before subscription expires, give name and address to publisher who made original call so that he may obtain renewal. If publisher does not succeed, within four months Society will send Expired Subscription Back-Call Slip for a further call. Bible study servant suggests arrangement be reviewed so all will understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (5 min.) [Use of S-10 form] Several publishers have been given slips for subscriptions about to expire. One is now interviewed for results and he is enthusiastic about arrangement. Of five subscribers called on, three renewed. He states it is easy to get renewal while subscription is still active. He briefly relates one experience where he used suggestions offered in February “Informant” to obtain renewal. One subscriber seemed to lack interest in “Watchtower”, so he introduced “Awake!” as different type of magazine and obtained subscription. Bible study servant queries, “What do you think should be done with subscriber who will not renew when called on by publisher who originally took subscription?” The reply, “Why not have another publisher make a call when Society forwards the Expired Subscription Back-Call Slip!” Next scene shows how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (6 min.) Bible study servant has expired subscription slips from Society. He calls another publisher and asks him to make call and give former subscriber another opportunity. Publisher expresses willingness but is not sure what to say. Bible study servant demonstrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Good evening, is Mr.--in? . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How do you do, sir. My name is Mr. --. I’m a minister visiting some people in the neighborhood and would like very much to talk to you for a few minutes. I was just advised by the publishers that your subscription for ‘The Watchtower’ has expired. Appreciating the great value of this magazine myself, I believe you will want to have it continue. Most people do. Take this issue of March 1, for example, with the article ‘The World’s Integrity on the Wane’. It shows from the Bible why there is so much corruption, scandal and evil-doing in the world. (Continue and show interesting points of this issue.) I feel sure you will want to resubscribe, knowing now how great a help ‘The Watchtower’ can be. The cost is only $1 (about 4 cents a copy) and you receive these three booklets free.” This presentation should be well prepared. We realize that at one time he did have interest, which has now apparently cooled. Perhaps he never really read and understood the magazine. Give him another opportunity to keep it coming. Any subscriptions obtained from expiration slips (L-15) are counted as new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan . . . Activity </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font3">reach the 20 per cent peak. Last year 196,266 persons attended the Memorial celebration. At least 50,000 of these persons did not publish at all in 1952. How can we help Memorial attenders in 1953? Here is where diligent planning will come into play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two Big Week Ends</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Beginning with the first of March, work toward getting everyone out in field service. The week end prior to Memorial (March 28 and 29) will be one of special activity from the Kingdom Hall. Then before Memorial organize your servants, study conductors and good publishers. Make them responsible for meeting and getting acquainted with new persons who occupy certain rows of seats in the Kingdom Hall on Memorial night. Introduce yourself; ascertain their names and where they live. Make arrangements, if possible, to take them out in field service. One servant, study conductor or publisher might take care of two persons in this way. So organize to talk to them all!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The speaker will tie in faithful service with the meaning of the Memorial. Concluding announcements will include service the week end of April 4 and 5, which should also be a special week end of activity witli everyone assembling at the Kingdom Hall. Two big week ends of service at Memorial time, with diligent efforts made to help everyone into the field! Use your automobiles to best advantage in helping persons attend the Memorial, and then get them out in the service. Keep the 20 per cent peak in view and work for it 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Great numbers of people are now associating with us. Our big job is to show them how to really “worship Jehovah in holy array” by talking about the Kingdom. We must help them publish. Do not let this Memorial go by without a diligent effort to help everyone who attends. If we plan and then do our part conscientiously, we can easily reach 150,000 publishers. Will you be at the task, making every possible effort? (A Memorial report card is enclosed. Report total attendance, number partaking, and attendance at the public meeting on March 29. Mail your report immediately after the Memorial celebration, March 30.)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">The existence of all things is dependent upon Jehovah as Creator. For reasoning human creatures Jehovah instructs that there be a constant growing to accurate knowledge of him and hence to maturity of understanding by means of his spirit. Christians are thus required to do more than profess belief; they must “press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Each passing day brings the world assembly closer. The next few months will speed by and then it will be time to leave for the assembly site at Yankee Stadium. Do you have in mind how you will travel? Are you working out matters so you will be ready to go when July comes? Now is the time to make your arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Automobile travel will undoubtedly be used by most conventioners. All cars should be filled, travel expenses determined, day of departure to and from New York worked out, and other important matters considered. By each one's knowing what is expected of him, full co-operation and a pleasant trip will result for car groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Commercial transportation will be limited and lacking from many points this summer due to other large conventions and heavy tourist travel. However, our convention travel will not be unduly interfered with if individual arrangements are made immediately. It simply means making your reservations before other travelers make theirs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If iron intend to use train or airplane travel, make your round-trip reservations note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> In a few short months tens of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses will be New York bound. It is suggested that you arrive here on the 18th of July and schedule departure for the 27th or 28th. The time to plan and arrange is now !

<p><span class="font3">All Christians pressing on to maturity are invited to demonstrate their active faith by sharing in the presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer </span><span class="font3">during the final month of the campaign.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Every individual who rejoices in the truth is moved to participate in field service activity. He is thus obeying Jehovah's instructions found at Romans 10: 10, .Vil'. Regularly, every month, his mouth should be used to speak the truth to others. Such a person is a regular publisher.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> What constitutes field service activity that should be reported by all publishers? Primarily house-to-house work, making back-calls, conducting home Bible studies, street witnessing and store-to-store work. Incidental witnessing to salesmen, business associates, friends, etc., may also be reported. Those who are unable to actively engage in regular field work due to physical limitations are especially encouraged to seize opportunities for incidental preaching, as well as write letters, use the telephone and take advantage of other means to have part in Kingdom work every month. Time spent in such essential service as visiting the sick, working around Kingdom Halls, etc., is not reported as field service.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Oryanixation,</span><span class="font3"> 1f 31.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">During April we have two primary goals to reacli: attaining the 20 per cent increase in publishers, and obtaining our individual quota of subscriptions for the campaign. Do not forget the new publishers and persons of good will who could share this privilege with you. With everyone, servants and publishers, working toward aiding all associated and those who attended the Memorial to publish during April, every company will reach the 20 per cent increase in publishers. Think of it; if we reach this goal, we will have over 150,000 publishers of the good news! Let us do our best to reach it by pressing on to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">which includes training in the ministry. A young minister will start turning in field service reports when he understands what he is doing and is able to give a reasonable answer for the hope within him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> When a new publisher is taken in field work, preferably from house to house, he should be invited to report his time. But to turn in a report at the end of each month for new individuals who might have had an incidental discussion hardly makes them publishers. A new publisher should engage in at least one of the regular features of service, and he should appreciate the work he was privileged to do to the point of wanting to turn in his own report. Publishers are encouraged to turn in a field report at least once a week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> By the third day of each month the company servant should receive from the assistant company servant the report card containing the company’s total field service report. After checking and signing it, the company servant will see that it is put in the mail, at the latest by midnight of the 3d. If the company is to submit an accurate and complete report to the Society, all publishers, moved to joyfully participate in field service activity, must promptly turn in field service and Bible study reports.</span></p></li></ul>

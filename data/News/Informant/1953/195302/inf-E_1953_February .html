<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> It is normal and natural to love one’s life and to work for its preservation. But man is not able to save himself. Neither will his supporting seemingly plausible human schemes bring any reward. Jehovah alone affords the sure means of salvation. In these momentous days just prior to Armageddon, Jehovah outlines the course of wisdom for us in fixing our destiny: &quot;Choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; to love Jehovah thy God.” —Dent. 30:19, 20, AS'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Men, therefore, must know Jehovah and serve him in order to live. But how “will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard”? Rallying to the call, Jehovah’s true witnesses accept their commission and move forward in the preaching work. During February they will continue to obtain subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">with good-will persons, so that they can utilize the vital information contained in each issue in choosing life. For the relatively small amount </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of $1 </span><span class="font3">a year’s subscription can come regularly to the homes of these people to satisfy their thirst for good news. Did you obtain a subscription during January? Were you W’orking from house to house, meeting people and presenting the offer? Are you striving to obtain or even exceed your quota of two during the campaign, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness? Use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in feeding the Lord’s sheep and help them gain life. Search for them by going to the homes!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> To obtain subscriptions means to go out and talk to the people at their homes, where we can point out to them the benefits of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> And do not neglect to aid others to get in the service by taking them with you. If you need help in presenting the offer and making back-calls, do not hesitate to caU upon the company book studyconductors and more mature publishers to lend a helping hand. Let everyone assume a personal responsibility to call back where subscriptions are placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> During January the goal for each company was to reach </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> 10 per cent increase in average publishers. Did your company make it? If so, move forward now to reach the 20 per cent peak by the end of April. All companies can reach this goal if publishers associated are regular in the service every month and if new ones are assisted to begin public declaration of praise. We are interested in our saivation and we are interested in our neighbor’s. Therefore it is mandatory that we “stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you”. (1 Tim. 4: 16, All’) How<sup>7</sup> will they be able to listen? By our studying, training our brothers and encouraging one another to meet this objective: “Every publisher a regular house-to-house preacher of good news 1”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping Our 20 Per Cent Peak in View</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Reasonable Goal</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> As the planting and watering work continues, Jehovah gives the increase, true to his Word. The 1953 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> is a testimony to God’s blessing upon the efforts of his people to continue ‘speaking the truth each man to his neighbor’, for it is a record of increase and prosperity. Encouraged by the evidence, each servant of Jehovah should regularly join in the preaching work and also assist others who are righteously disposed to offer the fruit of their lips.—Heb. 13:15, ATP.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The goal is a 10 per cent increase in average publishers, which means reaching the quota for 1953; and, beyond this, striving for a peak of 20 per cent over the average number of publishers in 1952. Did your company report “We made it I”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Magazine Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To ensure the best possible service to new subscribers, companies should be certain to forward subscription slips </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">at least once a week. </span><span class="font3">Some companies have been holding slips for several weeks, which means that subscribers do not get their magazines through the mail for a long period of time. Promptness in forwarding subscription slips cannot be overemphasized, particularly during a campaign when the Society's mail is heavy. Publishers, too, should bear in mind that it takes from four to six weeks before the magazine arrives through the mail. It is evident from letters received by the Society, many from strangers, that some publishers promise arrival of the magazine in two weeks. Subscribers do not get it in two weeks, hence they write the Society, complaining or canceling their subscription and asking for a refund. If publishers follow the suggestion of delivering several Issues, this matter will be cared for; but, at any rate, do not promise the magazine’s arrival under a time of four to six weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for January? Will you be able to report “We made it!” for the 20 per cent peak in April? Consider how reasonable a goal we have.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The potential is great. In the United States last year there were actually 146,786 publishers associated with the organization. This means that every month there were, on the average, 20,000 dedicated servants who did not get out in the field. What would result now if </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font3">published each month? A 16 per cent peak over average publishers for 1952! That leaves only foui‘ per cent to make our goal of a 20 per cent peak. Already in this service year the United States shows more than a four per cent increase. So the new publishers who come to the organization will more than account for the difference to go well beyond </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Present &quot;The Watchtower&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The Watchtower’’ is a great aid in helping people choose new world life Do you fully appreciate what it can do for those who receive it regularly? The 1953 &quot;Yearbook&quot; report from Argentina demonstrates its power to influence lives of persons with honest hearts. (90, 91) In Finland it produces good results by going into the homes regularly. (158) Subscriptions can be obtained if &quot;The Watchtower&quot; is presented even though circumstances do not appear favorable, as demonstrated by a pioneer sister in Egypt, who obtained 39 in one month. (151)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report from France tells how the brothers, with an improved magazine, redoubled their efforts and obtained nearly twice as many subscriptions in the first month of the campaign, to compare with the previous year. How did your company do in January? It shows, too, the happy results often produced in homes even with persons other than those who actually subscribed. (161)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are many different opportunities for obtaining magazine subscriptions if the publishers will only take advantage of them. Read the report from Netherlands West Indies and see if you can follow the example of the brothers there. (217) In Newfoundland one company publisher finished the 14th &quot;Watchtower&quot; campaign with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. Incidental preaching helped him. (218) Does it help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If your company had success with the October, 1952, &quot;Awake!” campaign, there is more reason why you should have success with &quot;The Watchtower”. Are you stressing &quot;The Watchtower” with vigor and enthusiasm?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘Let Us Return and Visit’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you often discouraged by lack of results when you make return visits on persons who shou ed some interest? Consider the case of the publisher in the Azores who made visits on a Catholic lady every two or three months. A friendly contact was maintained over a long period of time and in due course this woman began to appreciate the truth. Moreover, she moved her friends to take an interest. Was the time spent on an occasional visit time well-spent? (72) Note, too, the happy experience that resulted from following through on a good-will call sent by the Society. (73)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What do you do when you </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">call</span><span class="font2"> back and find that people have not read the literature you placed with them? Do you give up with a few passing remarks? In Thailand two special pioneers encountered a situation like this, and it was not until the third back-call that they were able to persuade her to take time to read a few paragraphs. In three months she began to publish; in six months she entered pioneer service. Think of the good fruits of back-calls on this person that might have never been realized if the publishers were turned aside because she had not read the literature. (276)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alert publishers in Uruguay follow through on good-will names turned in at their assemblies by visiting brothers, with good results in producing publishers. (281) Even a request for a Bible, properly cared for and followed up, can produce a publisher in a few months. (282) Keep up house-to-house preaching with the current literature offer, yes, but do not forget return visits to many of these houses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Many persons allow their subscriptions to expire and then resubscribe when the Society sends the “Expired Subscription Back-call Slip” to the company and a publisher calls. They want the magazine to continue to come to their home, but they need your help before their subscription expires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you were the one who obtained the original subscription and the Bible study servant gives you a slip about a month before the subscription expires (as he should do, working from his S-10 sheets), you might approach the subscriber like this: “Hello, Mr.---, You</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">probably remember me, for I took your subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> some time ago. I was in the neighborhood today and decided to drop by and see how you are enjoying the magazine, particularly this latest issue. I certainly appreciated this article. (Proceed to discuss some points in the latest issue, allowing him to express himself.) I am sure you can now see that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> stands in a class by itself when it comes to aiding us to understand the Bible. People of good will toward God everywhere are fast realizing that Jehovah’s kingdom is the only lasting solution to our problems. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">announces that kingdom, teaches us from the Bible what it is, where it is, why it is necessary, and when it will come. Y<sup>T</sup>ou have been receiving the magazine for almost a year now and your subscription is about to</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Correspondence Suggestions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">(Part 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not safe to send currency through the mail; therefore companies should use money order, check, bank draft or any remittance of this type. A record of the check number or serial number of such remittance should be kept by the company or individual. Some companies have been sending separate checks to 117 Adams Street for cash items, literature account, subscriptions, etc., when one check (with properly tilled-out remittance form) could be sent to cover the complete remittance. Of course, separate checks should be sent for Good Hopes and expire. As a free service to our subscribers, we call back to personally assist them in making their renewal. You will recall it is only a dollar for a year, and I would be glad to handle your renewal for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you were not the one who obtained the original subscription, you might say something like this: &quot;Mr.---? My name is---,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and I am representing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine for which you are a subscriber. No doubt you have gained much helpful information from the magazine during the past year, for it has indeed covered many important topics and questions, as you will note from the index in the December 15 issue. Unquestionably you have enjoyed some of these (name a few prominent topics and give person opportunity to express himself). Actually those issues that you have already received compose a library of Bible information that is available to you through the use of this subject and scripture index. Since your subscription is soon to expire, I would like to encourage you to renew it now and thus avoid missing any copies. I would be glad to aid you, and it is still only a dollar for the year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although the publisher gives no booklet premium and cannot count the subscription renewal on his field report, the joy of knowing that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtourer</span><span class="font3"> is continuing to spread the message of life in the homes of these people will bring real satisfaction. If you obtain a renewal, advise the householder to ignore the regular expiration notices in the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1953 world assembly travel donations, but these go to the Treasurer’s office at 124 Columbia Heights. They should not be included as part of a general remittance for other items. Except when the remittance is for subscriptions only or is a donation, a remittance form should always accompany the check, money order, etc. The company servant should carefully look over the remittance form before signing it to see that all entries are correct and that the total listed corresponds with the amount of the remittance; also that there is a clear indication of how the money is to be applied, i.e., Literature Account, Cash Items, Magazine Account, etc.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7"> MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first demonstration below illustrates importance of appreciating “The Watchtower” and handling it properly. The second demonstration covers the making of back-calls on new subscribers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Appreciating “The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(5 min.) Conductor makes intro-ductoiy remarks on importance of each publisher’s appreciating value of “The Watchtower”. Attention given to study of it, carefulness and diligence in handling and distributing it —these indicate the value we place upon it. He introduces four brothers who represent recent issues of “The Watchtower”. They begin talking about their contents, value of the magazine, great amount of research in gathering and preparing material, time and energy spent by brothers who produce printed material (1953 “Yearbook” page 69). Each tells story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(2 min.) First is a “Watchtower” who goes to country under iron-curtain ban. He tells of great risks undertaken by brothers to get him and distribute his valuable spiritual food (“Yearbook”, page 169). He relates he is sometimes torn apart and taken one page at a time to be studied; and sometimes he is even copied off by hand or typewritten and passed around in that form. The majority of his fellow issues who try to get through by mail are taken by the censors, so he must go through by private means. A tough job'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(2 min.) Second is “Watchtower” from home of U S. publisher. He recounts sad experience of being stacked with other issues and neglected. He looks forward to being eagerly grasped and read, but literature is plentiful in this country and, for the most part, he is not welcomed as he should be Often he is thrown around and forgotten, getting wrinkled and dog-eared; and sometimes all the attention he gets is two trips to the “Watchtower” study. He bemoans fact that all his wonderful contents are imprisoned and hidden instead of being; read and put into hands of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(2 mtn.) Third says he is much worse off than first two. He was so happy to be a subscription copy, but publisher was careless with address on subscription slip. So he was thrown in pigeonhole in musty post office, there to be joined by fellow issues in same predicament. He remembers overhearing a conversation right after he came off the big press back at the factory showing how much it costs the Society to print him and his fellow issues, and how much reproach and loss of prestige is suffered by his good name when subscribers of good will fail to get magazines. If only publishers would take an extra minute or two and be accurate about his address. But they did not, and now he and some of his fellow issues are back at the factory waiting to be sold as scrap, and the Society had to pay for their return. What a sad end!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4 min.) All turn to fourth “Watchtower”, who is very happy. He looks marked up and well-handled. Why? Ah, that’s the reason he’s happy. He is subscription copy who got to subscriber He relates how publisher put him, nice and clean, into hands of person at door. He tells what publisher said about, him, how subscription was obtained and great care exercised in filling out subscription slip. Now he has been joined by fellow issues of “The Watchtower”, who arrived through the mail. Why does he look so well-handled? Publisher called back and demonstrated how subscriber might get the most out of him. From forest to paper mill, to press where he joined with words and ink to be full of rich thought, the result of hard work; and on to a long ride through the mails, looking-attractive and full of high hope—now to be read and appreciated'. What a joyful conclusion! What a worth-while existence! If only each company publisher would see to it that all his ^ellow issues shared this usefulness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Calling Back</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (2 min.) Bible study servant is at Kingdom Hall looking over his S-10 sheets and Publisher’s Record cards. Some publishers, he notes, have obtained subscriptions in January but have reported no back-calls thus far. Why? It would seem publishers lack appreciation for importance of magazine and its value to the reader. He decides to talk to a publisher about back-calls on subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (6 min.) Publisher comes into hall for meeting and is approached by BiDie study servant and asked if he has, as yet, had opportunity to visit subscribers with latest issues. “No,” he has not. Then he says negatively, “There is no use bothering to call back; they will get the magazines in time. The Society always sends the magazines.” Bible study servant is concerned over this attitude and points out interest must be kept warm. When a fire is kindled, fuel must be added or it will shortly go out. The same applies to placements. Not calling back could cause the spark of interest shown by these people to go out, even with fuel before them. “Oh, no, the spark of interest will not die out if they have the magazines coming,” the publisher says. Bible study servant points out that interest may die if it is not fanned and helped to grow into a bigger blaze. “But back-calls are too hard for me,” argues the publisher. “They only seem so because you have not tried making calls,” says servant. Publisher and servant agree to go together on initial call, and they discuss plans. They will discuss various features of magazine to emphasize its real purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (7 min.) Bible study servant and publisher call at home and when admitted publisher introduces servant as a fellow minister. They have brought latest issue. They ask householder if, when reading the copy left with him before, he noted the various features and types of articles. First of all, the purpose of the magazine as shown on the front cover, the short articles pointing out the hopelessness of present conditions, yet giving hope for those who love Jehovah; the articles on traditions of some peoples in contrast to Bible <sup>!</sup> teaching. Did he agree with the answers to the questions from readers? Bibles are brought out and texts dealing with certain points in the main article are read and briefly discussed. A question is brought up and some of the fine points of the article are shown. The practicalness of the magazine for our life is seen. A friendly, tactful and considerate attitude is shown and householder readily agrees to another discussion next week. After leaving the home, publisher and servant discuss the merits of initial back-call on subscriber, and publisher notes how easy it is. Servant points out they will bring study copies of “Let God Be True” next week, for householder knows little about basic doctrine. They may be needed for reference in discussing “Watchtower” material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 Per Cent Peak </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">20 per cent. What is the answer, then, in order to reach the 20 per cent peak? Simply </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">regularity</span><span class="font3"> on the part of those already dedicated and experienced in the field. How many in your company are among the 20,000 each month? Check your cards and help irregular publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Working for It</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> First, each publisher should definitely arrange to have part in field service each and every month. Secondly, all should co-operate with the local company servants, who will arrange systematic field work so that all publishers can share and be assisted. Sunday morning house-to-house witnessing will be a part of each company's arrangements, for two hours at least, in addition to such midweek group witnessing as is practicable. Fine results are forthcoming from use of company book studies as service centers where the arrangement is really used effectively. The study conductor should be alive and as much interested in the field work of those associated as in their attendance at the book study. His enthusiasm should fire the publishers to cooperate on Sunday morning in house-to-house work. Through the study conductor assistance will be given to those who need it. They will accept this loving help and enjoy a part in making public confession for salvation.—Romans 10:10. ffW.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Thousands of home Bible studies are being conducted. Encourage them to join with you. Start them properly by taking them from house to house with you. From the start they should appreciate house-to-house activity as the basic method of preaching the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Now Is the Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Memorial falls on March 30. Shall we wait until then to work for the 20 per cent peak? No; let us all start now. We know our goal, and the potential is there. Diligent efforts in working for it will bring Jehovah’s blessing. So now is the time to unite our efforts with determination, looking to a new alltime peak in our company at the latest by the end of April. That will mean more than 150,000 publishers in the United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The month of March affords us </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">splendid opportunity to push the advancement of clean worship, because it is the Memorial month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How Important Is the World Assembly to Xou?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Most important? It should be so. It was important for the ‘sons of God’ to assemble before Jehovah, for the Israelites to assemble under the law arrangement, for the early Christians at Pentecost, and it is important that every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who now recognize the New World society, attend the world assembly if at all possible. That important? Yes! Come, see and hear for yourself and at the same time be richly -blessed, for Jehovah has many blessings in store for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whether new’ in the truth or a servant of many years; young or old: rich or poor; district servant, circuit servant, pioneer or company publisher; whether located in, close to or many miles from the assembly city, supporters of the New World society have heard Jehovah’s assembly call for July 19 to 26, 1953, and are directing their affairs so as to be in New York city. It means planning vacations, saving that penny here and dollar there, utilizing all available and possible automobile transportation to the full, assisting others wherever possible and, yes, many other things so as to be able to attend. Important? Indeed, so much so that God’s servants are willing to make great sacrifices and adjustments to attend!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The world assembly will be of sufficient importance to far outweigh the efforts required of you to attend. Set in motion your arrangements now. Think, plan and work to be in New York in July I It IS important to you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Plan now to have a big week end in service on March 28 and 29, to be followed by the Memorial celebration on March 30. Let every publisher put forth the effort to get out in the house-to-house work during that week end. It is entirely possible for the United States to reach new all-time peaks in March and April if all brothers show appreciation for the house-to-house ministry. Extend a warm invitation to every person who has a Publisher’s Record card in the file, and those with whom studies are being conducted, to visit homes with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Keep before the people the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Talk it house to house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">COMPANY ORGANIZATION</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Pioneer Co-operation</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The full-time minister of Jehovah God not only has the obligation to meet the regular pioneer requirements, but he also should co-operate closely with the company with which he is associated. He can enjoy the benefits offered by the company organization and, in turn, will reciprocate to the mutual welfare of all in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The pioneer assigned with a company should co-operate in all company activities in so far as possible. He attends and participates in all the various meetings arranged and adjusts his schedule in order to support the company’s field service activity, particularly on week ends. Also, he may have opportunity to take the lead in midweek witnessing on certain days. The pioneer can be of much assistance in helping and training new and inexperienced publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Where possible it is a good thing for the pioneer to support the company book study, both as a meeting and service center. If the pioneer holds a home Bible study on that night, such persons may be invited to go along to the company book study and thus have the first contact with a small unit of the organization. A well-planned schedule will permit the pioneer to aid good-will persons and publishers alike through co-operation with the company.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The somewhat limited time of the company publisher for service should not prevent full pioneer cooperation. When publishers accompany pioneers into the service, they should prepare to stay a little longer, if possible, realizing that</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Draft Proceedings Held Illegal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The United States Court of Appeals has recently held that the use of the F.B.I. secret investigative report, in cases where the conscientious objector claim has been denied and 1-A or 1-A-O classification given by the local board and also the appeal board, destroys and nullifies the entire draft board proceedings. Brothers registered with the draft who desire information on this may obtain it by writing the general counsel for the Society, Hayden C. Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the pioneer, besides lending assistance, has certain hour obligations to meet. When company service arrangements are made, the pioneer will ascertain how he can give loving help and share the companionship of his brothers in God’s service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The pioneer has more blessed experiences and more happiness ■ in unselfishly giving more of his time. However, there is no difference between him and the company publisher in that both are servants of Jehovah, both are required to do their best to honor Jehovah’s name, and both work together to promote the peace and progress of the company organization. Thus the company will not load down the pioneer with responsibilities that can and should be handled by the servants or other publishers, or expect the pioneer to do all the many things necessary around the Kingdom Hall, or expect him to use his equipment in Kingdom service without giving him some assistance where expense is involved. In turn, the pioneer will not feel that the company owes him something special or should show him deference in any way. Rather, both will feel the need of working together as members of a body do, as one man.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The pioneer will arrange for his needs In the matter of literature, copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> territory, etc., through the company, as well as turn in reports on Bible studies held during the month. With all members of the congregation keeping in mind at all times the unity, peace and growth of the organization, the blessing and approval of Jehovah are sure to be manifest, resulting in joy to everyone.</span></p></li></ul>

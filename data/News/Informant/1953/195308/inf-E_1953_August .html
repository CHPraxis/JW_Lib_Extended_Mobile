<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Publishers with Full Hearts Return to Work</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Pause, take time to consider: Who upon this planet have greater cause for gratitude than Jehovah’s witnesses and their good-will companions? At the recent New World Society Assembly the great happy Giver of the universe, Jehovah, opened the windows of heaven and poured out upon his people a blessing beyond their capacity to contain. Truly there are no people on earth so blessed as we are.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> However, this bountiful blessing places a great responsibility upon us. Are we going to emulate the great and happy Giver, Jehovah, by reflecting to others that which we have seen and heard at the assembly? We know there is no salvation anywhere apart from the New World society. Into this great sheepfold Jehovah is gathering his other sheep and we have an obligation to see that they are searched out. properly received, nourished and strengthened. With this in view, at the assembly he wonderfully equipped us for the work. We will receive greater happiness by thus administering to the needs of these other sheep. Are we now living up to theocratic responsibilities that this assembly placed upon every dedicated servant of the theocracy? This question should be carefully weighed by each of us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Present the Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> During August the chief presentation to the people will be three books and three booklets, on a contribution of $1.50. If the person to whom you are presenting the offer will not take the initial presentation, then it will be all right to drop down to one book. But the servants of Jehovah should always present first the combination suggested. By doing this we show ourselves to be mature servants and anxious to follow instructions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> August is the concluding month of our service year. Let us make it a high note of thanksgiving and praise to Jehovah by each one's having a part in the service. Do not fail to preach from house to house. Establish a goal of one set of three books for each congregation publisher, and four sets for each pioneer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Finish Your Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Some of you have unassigned territory to finish. Others have rural territory that lias not yet been worked. Now is the time to go into such territories. You will encounter farmers who are harvesting an abundant crop and they may not want to listen to you. Point out in a nice way that Jehovah is the great Benefactor of all men. Suggest that they show their gratitude by obtaining a greater knowledge of him. Others will have had their crops destroyed by storms, pests or other calamities. Comfort these with the hope of the Kingdom. Some congregations are limited to their own city territory, but they will be just as active. “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” So let each one give by being a publisher in August.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Six Months of Happy Giving</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Since January, 1953, publishers in the United States have had an especially happy time in preaching the good news. We have all enjoyed great blessings at Jehovah’s hand, because, since January, we have been well above our national quota of 139,289 publishers. Starting in January we took a big jump to 141,532; then to 143,004; to 149,501 and then to 153,624. In May we had 150,660 and in June 145,345, still well above our quota. Surely we all appreciate this marvelous expansion, and the Society is grateful to Jehovah for the opportunity of serving and working with so many happy givers. May we continue together in our joyful service and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, let us push the good news into every corner of this earth until our great God says It is done.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Pioneer Service for You?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Each year more and more are enrolling as vacation pioneers and are experiencing the many joys and blessings that can be theirs as they engage in this most important of all work. By the end of June this year over 1,149 publishers had applied for vacation pioneer service. Increasing in numbers each year are those vacation pioneers who find it possible to transfer to regular pioneer service. Perhaps you can do so this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> As part of the New World society, young and old, male and female, these happy life seekers are putting their time to most profitable use when engaging in pioneer service. Those who can do this work advance and Improve their service to Jehovah when they take the actual step of enrolling as a pioneer and then put forth the diligent effort, necessary to increase not only the quantity but also the quality of their work. Such are greatly blessed. Encouraging and stimulating are the blessed experiences had by these full-time publishers. Knowledge, understanding and appreciation of Jehovah’s Word, spirit and organization grow as one puts forth an increased effort to proclaim the new-world message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Pioneers who write in express themselves enthusiastically about the unequaled privileges that were theirs after they first took the initial step to turn in the application. They tell of difficulties that seemed to suddenly loom up; how' other problems crept in, obstacles and hindrances that made it seem almost impossible to continue on; and then how their perseverance resulted in overcoming such, and of the blessings that followed. It means work, but it is a happy life for the brothers who stick with it, worth every effort that one puts into it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneers Stay on List</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Parents, children, youths and aged alike testify to the grand opportunities afforded them as they engage in pioneer service. These have devoted themselves unselfishly, setting an example, encouraging </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on pane 3, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Unassigned Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Truly “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving/’ and publishers around the world experienced this to a large measure in working unassigned territory. (Acts 20: 35, NW) In the United States last year a tremendous expanse of territory was Worked with thrilling results. (64, 65) In Canada more than 80 per cent of available territory was assigned last summer and many persons were greatly helped. (127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The working of unassigned territory often requires traveling over great distances, but the results achieved in scattering seed are well worth the effort. Consider the report from the missionary schooner “Sibia.” (87) In working unassigned territory do you have to travel 1,000 miles from your home congregation? They do in Australia, but the results are splendid. (93, 94)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In British Guiana brothers working unassigned territory had to wade waist deep in water to push their boat over rapids and reach the people, but they were rewarded with sincere appreciation for their efforts. (113) In France it was remarked that the brothers were working like the apostles, twelve having gone to one town. French publishers slept in barns and bartered in placing literature, but much territory was covered. (162, 163) South Africans hitchhiked and &quot;walked to unassigned territory when no other means was available. (259)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers in Austria worked overtime to earn money for trips into unassigned territory. (100) See what the brothers in Cuba did to reach their territory. (139) Are you having part in the unassigned territory work in August?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Choosing New-World Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everywhere people are looking toward the new world and taking their stand for it. They see the issue quickly and realize their privilege of preaching the good news about the new world. In Ethiopia newly interested persons bring others to meetings with them on the third day after they themselves hear the message. And some, having had only a few weeks’ contact with the organization, take the seed to interior parts of the country. (74) In places where heretofore there were no native preachers, they are now springing up and taking a strong stand for the truth, as in Guam. (78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Often it takes only a reading of the publications to enable them to see that they must become part of Jehovah's organization. (79, 134) In some instances persons need only one contact with Jehovah’s witnesses to see their privilege of taking part in the preaching work. (167, 195, 208)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even some religious leaders are seeing the necessity to abandon their former false teachings and come over to the side of the truth, as the Korean report shows. (81, 82) The same is true in the Gold Coast. (172) In one case it was the congregation chart with all its figures that stimulated a religious “elder” to take a real interest in the truth. (260)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work Jehovah’s servants do in isolated places also bears fruit in helping persons make the right choice. (127) And special pioneers often have great joy in seeing people break away from false religion and take a firm stand for the new world, despite pressure to do otherwise. (101)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>In Unassigned Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Our approach in presenting the offer to a householder should be based upon the idea that we want to give a short sermon or talk. Bear in mind that these people do not hear the truth very often, but they do know what is going on in the world and how bad world affairs are. So, introducing yourself in a pleasant manner and telling where you are from, you might call attention to the troubles that have been afflicting the world since 1914; and point out that all man's efforts, no matter how sincere, have failed, to improve conditions. Inquire as to whether they ever had opportunity to compare world conditions with the prophecy of Jesus regarding the turbulent and distressing state of affairs that would exist just prior to the coining of a new world of righteousness. Open your </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New</span><span class="font5"> World </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Translation</span><span class="font5"> to Matthew chapter 24 and read a few verses: then make appropriate comment. What does it all mean? Weil, these three books help you to gain an understanding of the situation. Remarks can be made on the three books and their various features and subject matter, showing how they aid in understanding the Scriptures. Urge their obtaining three on a contribution of $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We placed literature in many homes last year and, with these persons and others, we will discuss interesting and enjoyable truths found in God’s Word. Now, since in most instances we cannot return for studies, our object should be to obtain subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Legal Notice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The federal court of appeals at Denver held on June 2G, 1953, that Jehovah's witnesses are conscientious objectors. The court said it is improper for draft boards to give one of Jehovah’s witnesses Class I-A. Any brother who filed a conscientious objector form and was classified I-A by either his local or appeal board may obtain a copy of the court’s opinion by writing to Hayden C. Covington, General Counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> In this way the magazines will regularly visit homes we cannot reach. Our approach in getting such persons to subscribe might be something like this: “These truths we have been discussing are very absorbing, aren’t they? Just like a well of cool sparkling water that satisfies a thirsty person, so the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines are filled with truth that is refreshing, enlightening and healthful. I personally never miss an issue. Why not have these two magazines come to your home just as they are coming to many hundreds of thousands of other satisfied readers in 3S different languages? They are only $1 a year for each,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps you will find many persons who received literature last year and who are quite interested in the truth. Encourage them to take part in spreading the good news to their neighbors, relatives and others. Suggest it this way: “No doubt you have wanted to tell a friend, neighbor or someone else about the wonderful hope you have gained, how the truth has thrilled you and how precious it has become to you. Well, you can do it very nicely with these little tracts. Just look at the different subjects they cover, giving a short and effective sermon on each topic. I’ll leave some of them with you if you would like to pass them out as you have opportunity. Should you want more, you may obtain a supply of 200 for 25c by writing to the Watchtower Society.” Then, in a month or two why not write that person a brief note of encouragement with the offer to supply additional tracts?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Request</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Special Memorandum</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Brothers classified 1-0 by local board and then I-A by appeal board should write to Hayden C. Covington, General Counsel for Jehovah's witnesses, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, for special memorandum covering procedure in such cases. Those not given 1-0 by local board need not request such memorandum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also brothers classified 1-0 by appeal board and thereafter I-A by the president should supply Brother Covington complete information concerning the matter.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The first demonstration below is a refresher on the assembly and how the good things received there might be used in our service, particularly with persons of good will. The second demonstration below will present talking points on the three-book offer.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Benefits</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (5 min.) What good did the convention do you? Will it help you bear good fruit in Kingdom service? Let us look at the Bible’s description of an assembly of old, with its results. (2 Chron. 30 24-31: 1) This scene may be a father speaking with his family, or a speaker may give a talk, reviewing briefly some of the blessings of the New World Society Assembly at New York, and showing the great impetus given to the advance of Jehovah’s worship by an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II </span><span class="font3">(5 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">min.) </span><span class="font3">Let us watch how two different publishers are affected. One makes a back-call. Conducting a Bible study, he ends it and the good-will person asks him how he fared on his New York trip. He then mentions how many were there, that there were some very good speeches and that it was a wonderful trip. Then he tells a little about New York sights. He promises to bring a printed report later. No real, specific truths or encouraging facts are brought out. It was just another convention to him as far as the good-will person can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To another publisher it was a real milestone of theocratic activity. He is anxious to close his study and tell about the convention. With his notes he gives some outstanding high lights —statements made, new truths, things the good-will person can understand and apply. He describes the harmony and the orderly operation of the various departments, the great advertising done. He shows some of the new releases. The good-will person is much encouraged and now desires to attend the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (10 min.) </span><span class="font3">In order to help publishers, brothers can be used to comment on things they got out of assembly that were striking and that can be used to get good-will or immature persons to act, to help them to start associating with a congregation and to engage in service. Brothers may comment from floor, or selected ones may give brief comments from platform. All may be encouraged to bring assembly features to those who were unable to attend as vividly as possible. Assembly can be topic of all gatherings and all conversations of Jehovah’s witnesses for months, whether at congregational meetings or other times of association and fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Present Three Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (2 min.) </span><span class="font3">Conductor sets the theme, gives the facts and figures on the local congregation’s progress with the three-book offer thus far, and emphasizes all-out effort in August, last month of 1953 service year, of everyone to be a publisher. New World Society Assembly spirit should now reflect itself in the field service. Points out most sets are placed in house-to-house work. To obtain best results all must get out in the field regularly and give the three books the opportunity to speak for themselves. No, it is not impossible to hear and see the books speak. He directs congregation’s attention to next scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (12 min.) Three publishers on the platform representing any three of the late books. Following one another in prearranged sequence each publisher representing a book utilizes four minutes of time. Each publisher orally outlines the main features and attractions of publication he represents. Also, each keeps in mind that he is an integral part of the three-book combination and, along with the two other books, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">comprises a</span><span class="font3"> power- ■ ful spiritual fighting force against this world’s darkness. Definite advantages must be shown in having each book, as well as the entire set of three, in the homes of persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An outline can be adapted for each book. Example: “My name is ‘Let God Be True’. Do you know that over 11% million copies of my two editions are in the homes of people of good will? This may be due to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are very familiar with my contents and use me extensively, and also that I try to present in a very practical and logical way Scriptural truth on doctrinal teachings. I am designed for both personal and group study, trying at all times to keep the mind centered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on specific</span><span class="font3"> material arranged in topical order. I’m printed in 30 different languages, have 26 chapters and over 300 pages of pure Bible truth, verified by quotations from 10 popular Bible translations. I endeavor to present the truth logically and plainly. People who are interested in knowing the Bible’s viewpoint on subjects such as ‘What Is Man?’ ‘Why Evolution Cannot Be True,’ ‘The Kingdom of God,’ ‘Resurrection,’ as well as 22 other basic doctrinal truths will find my contents to be comprehensive and accurate. To get the most out of me, I suggest that all who study me use the questions at the bottom of my pages and verify the Scriptural references made in their personal copy of the Bible. I must admit that I W’ork most efficiently alongside my two companions. Use us together and you will find us spiritually helpful and will learn to cherish us among your prized possessions.” Next book, represented by publisher, should present its points of appeal, and then the third. Tie in the three books working as one unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (1 min.) Conductor gives concluding comments. Help people who have righteous hearts to have truth at their fingertips. Aid them by knowing the value of the books’ contents and presenting them enthusiastically.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>New Year—New Quota</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">September starts the 1954 service year, and the new quota should be placed on the congregation chart. When the August report has been posted, ascertain the average number of publishers each month for the past year and add 10 per cent to this to determine the new quota. Remember, too, that our goal is to reach this 10 per cent average increase by the end of December, and then strive for a 20 per cent peak by the end of April. We did very well this service year. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, let us do as well or better next year.</span></p>

Among the vacation pioneers are many who will not be going back to school and who have no Scriptural obligations to keep them from engaging in fulltime work. Looking forward to increased privileges of service as pioneers many of these will want to be recipients of Jehovah’s favor as they seek to increase their service by staying on the list, thus bearing much fruit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> How about you </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> Are you one of the vacation pioneers this year? Are you one of many who received an application at the New World Society Assembly? If so, what have you done about it? Have you turned it in as yet? Have you taken the time to count the cost of pioneering? And also the cost of not pioneering (that is, if you can Serlpturally do so) ? Why not do something about the matter right now? Do not put it off. Send in your application; or, if you did not get one at the assembly, write for full Information on regular or vacation pioneer service. Specify which.</span></p></li>

Although nations of peoples have sweat, fought, bled and died in order to secure freedom for themselves, yet they have never achieved real freedom, but all are still slaves of corruption.

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Avoiding the “Sunday school” Idea of training children in true worship, Jehovah's theocratic organization places almost wholly upon the parents the responsibility to bring up their children “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” (Eph. 6:4) However, the congregation plays an important role in assisting the young publishers associated, just as it does the older, more mature publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> When service arrangements are made, children should not be neglected, but properly considered. Arrangements should be made for them to learn effective ways of preaching the good news from house to house as they grow to maturity, physically and spiritually. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> (1/15/52) stated: “In apprenticing the child in the ministry the secret is to give it some part in the actual work of preaching.” Parents are responsible for training their children in field service, but occasionally other mature ministers can assist in this regard. Likewise, for variety, sometimes two young publishers who are making progress in the ministry may work together. As they grow older, actual experience coupled with spiritual maturity will aid the young publishers to preach regularly without too much direct assistance.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Young publishers should be made to feel they are an integral part of the congregation and its activities. In a proper manner they should be encouraged and corrected from time to time, so that they will continue to advance to maturity in the ministry. Having a part in congregation activities, such as appearing in demonstrations occasionally and learning to comment at meetings in their own words, will help them much in feeling they are a part of the congregation. Boys should enroll in the ministry school when old enough to profit from this course so that helpful training and counsel can be afforded them in becoming effective ministers of the good news.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Servants should co-operate with parents in training their children while having a share in congregation activity. At the meetings, attendants can assist parents with children in many ways, such as in getting seated, maintaining order and helping them when it is required that they leave during the meetings. Likewise, while in the service children can be given supplementary training by servants in effective field work. “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depari</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Happy indeed is the man who dwells in the light of God’s love. Remaining in such love with zeal and integrity testifies to one's unity w’ith his Creator. Love, therefore, is made perfect by freeness of speech. (1 John 4:16,17, ATP) If we have freeness of speech, fear has been defeated by a righteous desire to serve Jehovah. How? By freely proclaiming new-world blessings offered by a loving God. Freeness of speech will permit all of God’s servants to let their light shine. Many of the other sheep, tossed to and fro on the turbulent sea of old-world propaganda, will thus have created within them a thirst for quiet waters of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Shiloah, which go softly.—Isa. 8: 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Granting the stranger his rights, publishers will show love during May by offering booklets packed full of refreshing truths, capable of bringing real hope and starting a good-will person on a steady course toward new-world living. Where possible, work with and stress ten booklets for 15c, thus distributing the greatest variety of booklets. If you do not have ten. then work with a combination of five booklets for 10c. Attractive wrappers have been supplied for these combinations. Where five different booklets are not available, place two for 5c; and bear in mind that you want to place at least one booklet in every home. However, publishers will find it easy to place a five- or ten-booklet combination, including some of the older booklets in each combination.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Train New Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> With such gi;and increases taking place, much training is needed by new publishers. This booklet offer lends itself well to field work by these new brothers. Therefore, organize group service through congregation book studies and let everyone share in door-to-door activity during May. Evening witnessing can be arranged. Do not hesitate to invite new ones to come along in booklet work. Train them to stand on their own feet and express true love toward others. Bring them into the conversation and invite comments from them as they accompany you from house to house. Let them get used to hearing their own voice and talking to strangers. Let them make a presentation from time to time, with you standing by to assist if</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">needed. As they grow in freeness of speech, share equally with them the grand privilege of witnessing by permitting them to talk at every other door. Be patient and considerate, and always counsel constructively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone a Preacher</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> All publishers, young and old, newly associated and those mature, have a splendid opportunity to demonstrate God’s loving way to others during this booklet campaign. Servants, let each study conductor know at the beginning of the month who need assistance; and on the 15th of the month make another check and render further aid to those needing it. Make it possible for all to get the benefit of God's loving organization. With this most attractive offer and with increasingly greater numbers of publishers, there is little doubt that this will be the greatest booklet campaign in the history of God's people. Do not let this campaign pass without doing your part. Remember, our love for Jehovah shows us to be in union with him, and this union is proved by our unity of action with his organization. (Congregations that run short of booklets may, if possible, arrange cash transfers of booklets from nearby congregations.)</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>World Assembly Rooming Work Under Way</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> On the evening of April 25 thousands of Kingdom publishers from the 41 units in New York city, along with 21 other congregations, will joyfully assemble together. Ten months have sped by since we were advised that the world assembly will be held in New York, July 19 to 26 Now it is time to start obtaining rooming accommodations. Suggestions and instructions will be given and the next morning, Sunday, everyone will be out looking for rooms. From now until world assembly time publishers will be going from door to door in New York city, happy indeed to be privileged to find rooms for their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Householders in 1950 were very favorably impressed with the commendable conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses and a good response</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">can be expected now. Why, some have already been heard to comment : “What, Jehovah’s witnesses coming again I That’s fine. Yes, I have a room”; or, “Oh, I’d like to have some of Jehovah’s witnesses stay with me again.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> More rooms will be required this year than in 1950, but do not fear that there will be no room for you. The greatest search for rooms that New York has ever seen will be under way, with all publishers applying themselves with diligence to this labor of love. Hotels are cooperating well, and we are confident that everyone will be adequately cared for in the matter of accommodations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">You Can Help</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Would you like to help in this big job? You can by filling out your Room Request Form carefully and completely, and then mailing it at once to Watchtower Convention, 557 West 157 Street, New York 32, N. Y. This will enable the convention to know how many accommodations will be needed so that the rooming work can be directed accordingly. (Do not forget to fill out the Application for Volunteer Service and give it to the congregation servant for mailing.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah's Witnesses </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Young and Old Can Preach</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jt was predicted that Jehovah’s spirit would move many to praise his name in the last days, including young persons and those old in years. (Joel 2*28; Acts 2:16-18, NW) In Poland we find this fulfilled, even under difficult conditions, as shown by the “Yearbook” report, in publishers as old as 100 and as young as 16 years. (249) Are you too old to imitate a 74-year-old pioneer in the Bahamas who devotes 90 to 130 hours to preaching each month? (103) Think of the 75-year-old publisher in North Borneo who conducts a regular home Bible study. (257) Do you sometimes feel that people to whom you witness are too old to get the truth and rejoice in it? Examine the report from Venezuela and ask yourself whether goodwill persons with whom you study are older than the woman mentioned. (284)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what about youth? Well, persons take notice that the organization abounds in young people today, as evidenced in the report from the British Isles. (117) Also, young folks in the truth are more than listeners; they are workers. Consider the young publisher who combines witnessing with her school activities in Guadeloupe (77) Even a 13-year-old house-to-house publisher is not abashed at meeting persons with strong but misguided feelings against Jehovah’s people. Have you ever been confronted with a situation like this young publisher in Finland? (158) Young ministers are ready to give an effective witness no matter what the occasion, as demonstrated by the 16-year-old publisher in Fiji who spoke to 40 people. (96)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All persons, the very young and those very old, can have part in preaching the good news regularly, if they wish to show love for others as Jehovah has shown love for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Incidental Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While everyone should take part in house-to-house preaching, publishers can often supplement their regular activity by taking advantage of opportunities for incidental witnessing. Often excellent results follow. Consider the “Yearbook” report on the brother in Brazil who took opportunity to witness while delivering coal. He started a study. Soon, because of the attendance, it was made a congregation study; and, finally, it reached a climax with 100 persons in attendance (110, 111) Incidental witnessing to one person will often open up the way to talk to many other persons, as shown by the report from Ecuador. (148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did you ever consider handing a tract to your storekeeper? See what happened in El Salvador when a sister did this, incidental to making a purchase. (156) Brothers who have secular occupations that keep them on the move from place to place can also find opportunities to preach. (183, 184) Sometimes a publisher’s occupation brings him in contact with people only too glad to have something to read, as reported from the Netherlands West Indies. (217) Incidental witnessing to employers, coupled with faithful service to them, can produce good results, too, as shown in Southern Rhodesia. (268)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bear in mind that there will be many opportunities for incidental witnessing while traveling to and from the world assembly in July. Will you be prepared to seize opportunities that present themselves? Be sure to report time spent in incidental preaching.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Every Kingdom publisher, new ones and those for a long time in the service, will want to have part in the May booklet campaign. It will be a pleasant change, furnishing an opportunity for publishers to distribute a great many booklets Attractive wrappers have been supplied, and the information on the wrap-tier can be used in your presentation of the booklets. You might say something like this:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> “I am calling to aid people of good will to come to a more accurate understanding of God's purposes as contained in the Bible. Perhaps you have tried reading the Bible and have become discouraged or lost interest because all the scriptures on one subject did not appear in one place In the Bible. To help you, I am presenting this miniature Bible library of ten pocket-size, easy-to-read booklets on a contribution of 15c. Each booklet has assembled the scriptures on the- subject under consideration, and these booklets include answers to many of our everyday questions concerning the Bible and present world conditions. Thus busy people may obtain the good news contained in the Bible in a short time. I am sure that, regardless of your religion, no matter what your position, whether you are rich or poor, you will find this Bible library very helpful.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> If the first and last booklets are turned so the titles can be seen, you might use them as specific examples of the type of information presented in the booklets. You could say this</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>British Edition of No. 10 Bible</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Brothers have inquired about availability of the British edition of our No. 10 King James Version Bible. This edition, which has been in use for several years now, is the same as the No. 10 Bible printed in Brooklyn, except that it is somewhat thinner and has a softer cover. It is available in black, blue, maroon and brown, at $2 per copy. Where possible, we prefer to receive orders for lots of five or more, which will be mailed direct from the British Isles, five Bibles to a package. If you order more than five, expect the packages at short intervals. Orders for the British edition should be sent to the Society in Brooklyn. to the householder: ‘‘I am a volunteer worker in this community, calling at the homes of the people to stimulate a study of the Bible. In these busy days of strife, turmoil and confusion there is not much good news available. But the Bible contains much helpful information about everlasting life in a new-world of righteousness, and to aid you in obtaining this good news these ten booklets have been prepared and are being distributed on a contribution of 15c. As you can see, this first one asks the question, Can you live forever in happiness on earth? and it presents the answer the Bible gives. The last booklet illustrates how this miniature library will appeal to all members of the family, for its title is Evolution versus The New World. This booklet is for the scientific mind that w'ants logically proved facts on this subject and reasonable proof of the reliability of the Bible. Other booklets in this set are equally informative and educational. I am sure you will enjoy reading this worth-while information.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> This is an offer that even the most inexperienced publisher can present, so be sure to get all newly interested persons out in the booklet work. Strive to place a full set of ten or five booklets. If you cannot do that, drop to two booklets for 5c. Endeavor to leave one booklet at every home on any contribution. We can put Kingdom literature in hundreds of thousands of homes during May. Will you go forth and enjoy this activity? You will be glad you did!</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers should manifest a positive, optimistic attitude relative to at* tending the world assembly, realizing its importance and encouraging one another and good-will persons to attend, as shown in the first demonstration below. The second demonstration emphasizes carefulness to details in applying for rooms and the proper thoughtful attitude toward the householder with whom you will stay in New York.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (3 min.) Publisher calling on good-will person encourages attendance at world assembly. He shows 1950 convention report and demonstrates enthusiasm for forthcoming assembly in New York. Good-will person, interested, asks about rooms, transportation. Publisher helps by showing Room Request form, then offers a place in his car for trip to and from New York, stating the cost for traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (3 min.) At congregation meeting good-will person talks to publisher about possibility of attending the assembly, but this publisher has negative attitude. “What!” says Negative, “travel all the way to New York when a little later on you will get the same things right here at home? I was there last time and once is enough for me. That city is too big and too crowded, and I just simply can’t find my way around by traveling in the subways like a mole! No, sir, not for me this time’” Good-will person is taken aback by negative talk. Congregation servant learns of incident and decides to give talk at next service meeting for benefit of the few who lack full appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (S min.) Servant, in talk at service meeting, shows purpose of assemblies and how necessary it is to hear Jehovah’s call to assemble. He recalls Israelite nation, with God’s commands to attend assemblies, not once but regularly. They made advance preparation and put money aside to attend. (Deut. 14: 22-26) They had farms and cattle to leave in the care of someone, but arrangements were made so they could go to Jerusalem. Children were taken along, even thougji primitive travel methods meant long, hard journeys. (2 Chron. 30: 5-11) But all of Jehovah’s people arranged to attend and marvelous blessings resulted. (2 Chron. 30:21-27; 31:1) Think, too, how happy the 3,000 were who were present at the assembly at Pentecost. What it they had missed? —Acts 2: 41, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE IV (4 min.) Publisher talks to good-will person as they ride home from meeting. He briefly refutes objections that negative publisher brought up and outlines proper viewpoint toward the world assembly. He points out that one must plan to get greatest spiritual benefit while at convention by attending all sessions. It is illogical to make long trip to New York and then not attend the sessions of the assembly. If he wishes to see other sights, he can do this before or after the convention. Good-will person agrees that vacation time and money will certainly be spent best by attending world assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (10 min.) Brothers Jones and Brown meet at the Kingdom Hall Brown has just received his room assignment card and is quite elated. He says, “We are all ready for the assembly now, because we have received our room assignment. I hope this one turns out as well as the one in 1950.” He tells of the good time had talking to householder every evening after sessions and how impressed she was on. being taken to public meeting. “You know we corresponded quite a long time after the 1950 assembly. In one letter she told of someone calling on her. A study was started and now she is attending meetings. So you can see why I’m so anxious to meet the people I shall stay with. At my earliest convenience I’m going to write and let them know we received this assignment in their home for the eight days, and that we plan to arrive on Saturday afternoon, July 18, and are looking forward to meeting them. The telephone number is on this card, too, so I plan to call her when I arrive in New York. Say, Joe, what Is the matter with you? You look sort of glum about something.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Joe answers, “Well, I got a card too, but not that kind. Mine is a card marked ‘INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION’. Apparently I did not take enough time to fill out my Room Request form, because this card shows I failed to give the date I expect to arrive in New York, and I did not check the price I desire to pay for a room.” Brother Brown looks at the card and says, “You will have to write to the rooming office right away and give them the necessary information. Did you see this notation too? It says to enclose this card with your letter.” Joe, discouraged, says, “I guess it will take two weeks or more now before I get my room assignment. Oh my, and we wanted to be together too, but no doubt this will mean we’ll have to be separated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Brown assures him not to worry about that part, because it probably will be necessary to use the subway anyway to get to and from the stadium. “I remember three years ago the Society suggested we use the subway because of the extremely limited parking space around the stadium. You know, when I got on one of those things I had no idea where I &quot;was going. Everyone seemed to be racing somewhere, and no one paid any attention to me. I finally asked a man how to get to the stadium. He stopped and very pleasantly gave me the directions. So, no matter where we stay, we can just arrange to meet at some location in the stadium. You remember that we both volunteered to work in the salad-making department of the cafeteria, so we will see each other there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (4 min.) Shows publishers arriving in convention city on July 18 (in the afternoon). They both call their householders and are directed to their respective homes, one to the Bronx and the other to Brooklyn. Publishers meet householders with very pleasant and friendly greetings and briefly discuss arrangements for coming and going each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (4 min.) The brothers report at salad-making department in kitchen and while working relate their experiences. Brother Brown has pleasant room, and householder has agreed to come to public meeting. Jones is similarly pleased even though located some distance from Brown. Brother Brown called householder he stayed with in 1950 and learned she is now a publisher with Upper Bronx unit. Arrangements were made to meet at the stadium one day of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Report Slip for Congregation Publishers </span><span class="font5">With this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> you will find several specimen copies of a new report slip to be used by congregation publishers in reporting their field service. This slip is designed to show the publisher’s activity for an entire week, running from Monday morning to Sunday evening. Entries can be made daily, and then the slip can be totaled by the publisher and turned in Sunday evening. Activity for each month will be kept separate, however. For example: June ends on Tuesday the 30th. A slip will be made out for Monday and Tuesday, June 29 and 30. But a separate slip will be made out for Wednesday to Sunday, July 1 to 5, so that activity for July will not be Included in the June report of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers are encouraged to report field service once a week as far as possible, for this will make it much more convenient to total the congregation report. Of course, a publisher may turn in a report for one day’s service at the end of that day if he wishes to do so, using this new slip. It is suited for daily reporting as well as weekly, but weekly reporting is encouraged. However, it is always better to get one report than none at all; therefore, do not be dogmatic in insisting that publishers use it weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inasmuch as there are quantities of the old field service report slip (S-4) on hand in the congregations these should, to avoid waste, be used up before the new slip is put to use. The Society will continue to send out supplies of the old slip now on hand until these are gone. Advance notice is given now of the new S-4 slip so that publishers will know how to use it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> As a part of happy living, everyone desires to be blessed with prosperity. However, many selfishly seek only material prosperity and thus fail to attain real happiness that comes with the spiritual prosperity of God. Jehovah’s servants display wisdom by centering their affections on the blessings of spiritual prosperity that Jehovah now showers upon his constantly increasing organization. With unmatched zeal they now invite other lovers of righteousness to share in the prosperity of God's people at this critical time.—I’s. 106: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font5"> 5, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Again it is the privilege of God’s servants during the next three months, June, July and August, to call on persons living in unassigned territory. The offer will consist of any three bound books with three</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This book is out of stock at Brooklyn. We do not know when we shall have time to reprint it. If any of the congregations have extra copies in stock it would be good to get them into the hands of brothers who need them in other congregations. If nearby congregations do not need your extra stock, please write to Brooklyn and let the Society know how many copies you would like to ship to someone else.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Talks on Bible Characters</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The ministry school talks on Bible characters should be developed in harmony with the principles of Lesson 4 in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font5"> Since there have not been specific articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on some of the characters, it will be necessary for the student to do research in various issues to obtain ample information to give rounded-out talks. This means searching the indexes (subject and scripture) of December 15 issues to ascertain where this information can be found in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">For example, information on the Bible character Achan can be found in the March 1, 1!)52, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The various issues discussing the Memorial and its celebration give information on Judas Iscariot and his betrayal of Jesus. booklets, on a contribution of 51.50. Plan to use tracts extensively during this period, leaving one or more at every home. They will contribute toward ‘scattering seed’, which may later bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Preliminary arrangements should now be made for all who can do so to engage in the unassigned territory work. There can be a full month of this activity before the convention in July. All publishers will want to participate in regular</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> In order that the needs of each congregation might be cared for orderly and efficiently, Jehovah has through his organization appointed the more mature ones in each congregation as servants to their brothers. They are set in various positions, “some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” (Eph. 4:11,12, 2VW) This gift </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to direct </span><span class="font5">and oversee the activities and welfare of a congregation is thus from God and must be cultivated in order to be used in the proper manner. “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as the right kind of stewards.”—1 Pet. 4: 10, A’II’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Some may feel, because of lack of education or due to natural incapability, that they are not very well qualified to lead in Jehovah’s service. They may feel they do not have the ability. But did Moses, Noah, David and other faithful men allow a feeling of incapability to prevail? No; they accepted their assignment with faith, and Jehovah backed them up. Jehovah knows a person’s limitations. When he sees </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fit to</span><span class="font5"> appoint one to serve through his organization, the individual should accept the assignment as from Jehovah and move forward with faith. Being charged with responsibility causes the appointed servant to get busy and learn all there is to know about his job so as to properly shepherd the Hock of God. It requires his being out front in theocratic activity and really leading the brothers in organized service. The congregation servant takes the lead In planning service activity. Where some are unable to go into unassigned territory, they can concentrate on working the scattered or little-covered sections in their regular congregation territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Unassigned territory work last year resulted in many rich experiences and blessings for Jehovah’s servants. The organization has prospered spiritually, for many isolated persons have taken up the preaching work and are now sharing in the prosperity of God’s, people. Let us invite still others to have a share in this heart-satisfying prosperity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">and supervising activities, while assistant servants contribute their parts. With all working together no feature of service will suffer and the best over-all results will be obtained.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Paul mentions that it is proper for one to ‘reach out for an office of overseer, since he is desirous of a right kind of work’. But with the position comes the responsibility to continually measure up to the qualifications of an overseer. It is not just a position of honor. He is, among other things, required to be irreprehcnsible, moderate in habits, orderly, qualified to teaeh, reasonable, not a lover of money, not a drunken brawler, and one having favorable testimony from people on the outside.—1 Tim. 3: 1-13, A W.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Where a servant is married, he must preside over his own household in a right manner and have his children in subjection with all seriousness. For, “if indeed any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God's congregation?” One who does not lead his children consistently in ways of righteousness, which include attending meetings regularly and participating in field service to the extent possible, would hardly be competent to lead the flock of God in these same requirements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Servant leadership is, therefore, required in all fields. His personal affairs must be arranged to give greatest possible attention to Kingdom interests. He contributes to meetings by preparing his parts well and commenting at studies. He is an. example by being regular in field service and he strives to aid others to share in and improve their ministry. He is a real loving shepherd of the congregation of God. Do you as a servant seek to meet these requirements?</span></p></li></ul>

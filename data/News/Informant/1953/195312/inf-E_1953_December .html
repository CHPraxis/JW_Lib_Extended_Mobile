<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> It is right that all men should worship Jehovah. None can escape or evade this fact, for he is the Fountain of life. To receive everlasting life from his hands one must drink the water of truth to learn his will and then be motivated to use the truth in rendering acceptable worship. It means conforming with 1 Chronicles 16: 29 (AS), where we are commanded: “Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him; worship Jehovah in holy array.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Members of the New World society will join in the worship of Jehovah during December by publishing and ascribing glory to his name. Everyone a publisher during December is our goal: so the 10 per cent increase in publishers will be met or exceeded. Jehovah has provided us with wonderful instruments to use: the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Creek Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> and a book, on a contribution of $2. This offer is most appropriate, for people will be celebrating what they feel to be the birth of Jesus. They will be interested in reading of the things he said and did. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> provides a very clear and accurate account of his life. If you have a supply of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation, of the Hebrew Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. I, you may use that too. However, the Brooklyn factory will not have Volume I in stock again until about December 15, 1953, so please do not order until then.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Tactful Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In going from house to house with the offer, we do not need to take issue with people about the date of Christ's birth or bring up controversial points. Our commission is to comfort those who mourn by tactfully presenting the truth. Use the occasion to point out the real purpose of Jesus’ coming to earth as a man and how his king dom will usher in the blessing for which man has so long looked and prayed. These points may be very effectively used in giving three- to eight-minute sermons at the door. Be sure to call back on all placements, having in mind the starting of Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Field Service Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In addition to regular witnessing opportunities, the holiday month of December offers extra time to worship Jehovah in holiness. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses win have a few days off from their secular jobs and school children will have a week or two free, all of which can be wisely spent in theocratic activity. Each one should ask himself this question: “How am 1 going to use my time during this period?” Surely not according to the way of the old world. Members of the New World society will make December an outstanding month by ascribing more than usual praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to Be Considered</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Among Jehovah's gracious provisions at the New World Society Assembly was the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth&quot;.</span><span class="font5"> The grand crowd of 134,333 assembled when it was released rejoiced to hear the speaker say it would be studied next at the congregation book study. By this time most congregations have begun a study of it. Those who have may well say, “This is just what we have needed.” And rightly so, for Jehovah knows what his people have need of, and he has provided in the new book essential knowledge for new-world living under the present reigning new heavens. What a grand study book from start to finish!</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A New Peak of Publishers in December?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> That is our goal! When all reports are received and tallied, a new peak of more than 153,962 publishers, our 10 per cent increase, will be anticipated. To make it a reality requires only that each congregation meet or exceed its 10 per cent average increase in publishers. Let all publishers and congregations do the following:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Each publisher is encouraged to engage in and report field service by the 14th of December. Ones assigned to train less experienced publishers will want to do field work with them before that date. Any publishers who do not report by December 14 should be given special assistance by servants and mature publishers, who will make definite arrangements to do field work with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Besides helping those who have already published, newly associated ones and those with whom we conduct Bible studies who are ready for service should be given an invitation to begin making public declaration for salvation. With special service</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued, on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Are you regularly attending the congregation book study and encouraging others to attend? It is a pleasure to report that congregation book study attendance has steadily increased, until in the United States it is now up to 60 per cent of the number of publishers. May more and more publishers come to realize the benefits of this study. Regular attendance at the congregation book study should be the desire of all publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> This study also proves to be a source of blessing for people of good will. Basic truths are learned and many frequently enjoy their first association with the New World society through this study arrangement From attending the study to using the information learned in the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Overcoming Obstacles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 127 different lands Jehovah’s witnesses encountered and overcame all kinds of obstacles in order to be able to preach to men of good will. Rather than stop or slow down when confronted with problems, they obey his command: ‘Do with your might what your hands find to do.’ Blessings result, as shown in the 1953 “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to work unassigned territory in Norway publishers had transportation and other obstacles to overcome. By careful planning these were worked out, only to find additional and unexpected ones on arriving in unassigned territory. These, too, were surmounted with grand results. (233, 234) Many new congregations are in the process of being formed because Kingdom publishers overcame obstacles to successfully preach. (164, 165)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneering is the ultimate goal of all appreciative servants of Jehovah on this side of Armageddon. In order to enjoy the full-time service, often obstacles in this materialistic world must be overcome. A publisher in Burma removed obstacles and now enjoys greater happiness in New World society activity. (125) Have you tried doing so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On obtaining a subscription we have been counseled to call back with issues of the magazine until the subscriber’s copy starts coming through the mail. How would you like to deliver all 24 copies to each subscriber? In Belgium a ban prohibits the delivery of magazines by mail. This obstacle was overcome with good results by publishers’ personally delivering all subscription copies. (105)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under favorable and unfavorable conditions Jehovah’s witnesses take advantage of all opportunities to preach the Kingdom message. Adverse conditions do not stop them, though at times they do result in their being brought before local police authorities, into court and before rulers. To comfort all that mourn God’s ministers press on “defending and legally establishing” their God-given right to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are you acquainted with the Society’s boqklet “Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News”? Could you use it if called upon to do so? Its effectiveness in defending our right to preach is shown on page 65.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For years much time, effort and expense have been directed toward establishing our right to preach from house to house with literature in the Province of Quebec. How good it is to know that the 800 court cases that have been pending may be put aside because in October, 1953, Jehovah gave his servants the victory in the case In the Supreme Court of Canada! (128) Now literature can be used in house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Switzerland police officials are no longer able to charge Jehovah’s witnesses as peddlers or disturbers of Sunday peace. The courts of that land have ruled: “The peddling law has no application to the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses.” (274) Italian courts, too, have given favorable decisions. (198)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When called before governors and rulers Jesus and his apostles established their God-given right to preach. Modern witnesses follow Jesus’ example (287) and have Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>From House to House During December</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> December is a religious month for so-called Christians. During the month much emphasis is placed on the Christmas celebration. Over and over the story of the birth of Jesus is told and many persons become more receptive to reading the Bible than at any other time. During this period it will be our privilege to present the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New 'World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </span><span class="font5">and a book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In presenting the Bible at the door, using a three- to eight-minute sermon, you might call attention to the importance of understanding the reasons for Christ’s coming to earth. One could say: “During this season of the year much is said about the birth of Jesus and our attention is drawn to the Biblical account found in Luke and Matthew. Have you taken note of what the angel Gabriel said to Mary about the child she was to bear? It’s found at Luke 1: 32, 33.” (Read it to them from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> or let them read it.) Then continue: “We hear much about the virgin birth and the tiny babe, but note here that the babe was to become king of a kingdom that would have no end. At Luke 2:14 the angels sang [read it] : ‘Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of good-will.’ Why? Because they knew the part he was to have in establishing God’s kingdom. This kingdom is the same one you pray for in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Worshiping Jehovah . . . </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">Special field service arrangements for the holiday week end should be made and definite plans to train and assist every publisher to participate in field work during December. It will result in each congregation’s reaching the 10 per cent average increase in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> There is only one group of people on earth today who can “ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name.” You who are reading this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> are of that group. Wisely obey Jehovah’s command to worship him in holiness by ascribing to him the glory due his name. the Lord's prayer. (Matt. 6:9, 10, AW) A study of the Bible will give you complete information about that kingdom and its blessing. To help you get that understanding, I’m glad to be able to offer this modern translation of the Greek Scriptures and this Bible study aid book to you on a contribution of only $2.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Another presentation might be: “Probably you have heard that Jesus said in the sermon on the mount: ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.’ I would like you to read that verse in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font5"> [Read Matthew 5:3.] See how much clearer the thought is? It is not just a matter of those who have a weak or poor spirit learning about and living under the reign of the King, but it is those who have become conscious of the need for spiritual instruction who will become happy ones. Further, here at John 17: 3, Jesus tells us that everlasting life is gained only when we take in knowledge of the only true God and the one he has sent forth. [Read it.] That is why we encourage you to study the Bible and bring you this translation in modern English. It is easier to read and the thought is so much clearer that studying it is a real pleasure. To further assist you, this book with many chapters highlighting not only the birth of Jesus but also the blessings of his reign as King will help you in satisfying your spiritual need. Together they are yours on a contribution of only $2.”</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> With keen anticipation all members of the New World society are looking forward to December’s report. Will it show a new peak of publishers, our first 10 per cent gain over last year’s average? It will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—if each publisher does his share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The Society will be glad to see your note on the bottom of your report card saying, “We made it.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first demonstration should be put on early in December. It emphasizes the practicalness of the monthly offer. The second demonstration deals with the training work being carried out in all congregations.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (2 min.) Publisher is in theocratic court for failing<sup>-</sup> to engage in house-to-house work with Bible and book offer. Attorney presents charges against publisher, emphasizing the dangerous position the publisher is putting himself in by withholding lifegiving truth from others. (Acts 5: 42, NW) Lovingly the publisher has been brought into court so as to receive theocratic correction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (3 min.) Publisher Is called to the stand and questioned by attorney, who establishes from publisher that house-to-house work has not been done in September and November, and doubts if it will be done in December. Why? Because publisher feels the “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures’’ is for witnesses, and, besides, $2.00 is more than most people have for the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">III</span><span class="font3"> (4 min.) &quot;NW” takes stand and on being questioned by attorney testifies it is not for witnesses only. Its clear understandable language can be a blessing to all lovers of truth and is what the people need. Armageddon is impending! The Kingdom is established! People must understand the trend of events if they are to live. &quot;NW” is glad it clears up doctrines, magnifies Jehovah’s name and can assist people of good will. As for being expensive, &quot;NW” says it contains knowledge necessary for people to find pearl of great price. &quot;NW” urges it be used in house-to-house work along with book, on contribution of $2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE IV (4 min.) Book takes stand and testifies to questions of attorney that it goes well with &quot;NW” and aids in systematic study. Material </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font3"> various subjects is gathered within its pages for convenient study. Bible and book have helped most persons in theocratic court to understand more of Jehovah’s purposes, and the tw<sup>r</sup>o will help many persons of good will —if publishers place them from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE V (4 min.) Householder next takes stand. Attorney uses points &quot;NW” and book made in asking householder if he needs them. Householder replies that they sound to be just what he lacks in understanding more about God, for he wants to have peace of mind in this troubled world. Attorney questions him on $2 contribution for Bible and book, pointing out the need for spiritual food that the combination fills. (Matt. 4: 4, NW) Householder agrees that spiritual diet must not be neglected and asks if he can obtain the offer now. Attorney then asks if others in his neighborhood might be interested Householder relates discussion he had with neighbor who did not understand events of the day and expresses the hope that publisher will go from house to house calling upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE VI (3 min.) Judge calls publisher to the stand and summarizes points made by Bible, book and householder. Then he asks publisher if his error in reasoning is seen. Publisher says &quot;Yes” and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wants to correct</span><span class="font3"> matters. Judge sentences publisher to comply with 1 Timothy 4: 15, 16 (NW), and concludes with exhortation for all to join in worship of Jehovah in holiness by sharing in house-to-house work regularly with Bible and book offer during December.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The Proper Mental Attitude</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (5 min.) Study conductor is talking to publisher New View, who is qualified to teach and train others in house-to-house work. New View is assigned to assist Old View w’ho has not been doing house-to-house work for some time. New View is hesitant and asks how he can approach Old View, who has been in the truth much longer. Conductor emphasizes instructions received at the New World Society Assembly and how mature publishers should tactfully encourage publishers not doing house-to-house work to join in this feature of Jehovah’s strange work. Whether young or old in the truth all publishers should do house-to-house preaching as set forth in the Bible. New View agrees the new arrangement is a loving provision, and will gladly do his part by making definite arrangements to assist Old View.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (5 min.) New View calls on Old View and tactfully,and in a loving manner discusses the encouragement all of Jehovah’s witnesses received at the New World Society Assembly. Also, the need for all to do house-to-house work is continually stressed in the &quot;Informant.” New View relates the joy that one has finding other sheep in house-to-house activity, and comments on Jehovah’s wisdom in having the witness work done from house to house. He has a territory that has not been worked with current offer, and asks Old View to come along with him Sunday. Old View replies he would like to, but his son and family are coming over Sunday. He just couldn’t make it. New View understandingly acknowledges Old View’s position and says he will call again so definite arrangements can be made in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (5 min.) Talking to himself Old View ponders over his discussion with New View. He used to go out in house-to-house work, but hasn’t for years. It is true, as New View said, at the convention the necessity of engaging in house-to-house work was emphasized, and the &quot;Informant” continually highlights it. Old View admits he should do the work and really wants to. Why, then, did he turn down New View’s kind invitation? Was it his pride that made him say what he did when he knew right well his guests were not coming until the afternoon? Brother New View was right. The other sheep are found mostly in house-to-house work, and what joy there is to find one interested in the Kingdom. Why should he keep on depriving himself of the happiness of giving? And, too, Acts 20: 20 outlines the need to preach from house to house. God is not partial; it means me as well as others. It is about time I get back into the good habit of going from house to house. If everyone else can do it, so can I. When New View comes and invites me to go with him next time, I’m surely going to accept the opportunity to get started in the house-to-house preaching work, and, undoubtedly, before long I’ll be in position to help someone else. I’m surely glad Jehovah has instituted this new arrangement and that his servants are willing to help i persons like me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Attend Study &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">field and becoming a part of the congregation is a short step. Do not hesitate to invite interested persons to attend the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Study </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> For a lively, interesting meeting to result, advance preparation on the part of the conductor and those attending is necessary. When all are prepared each one can comment, and thus contribute to the meeting. On opening the study it is good to briefly review material considered the preceding week. This gathers the thoughts of all in attendance to the material to be dealt with. Long chapters need not be covered in one evening. It has been generally found that six to ten pages can be profitably covered. Study conductors should oversee the coverage of material so all attending understand and grasp the points being made. Knowing the approximate number of pages his group will cover, the conductor can encourage advance study for the next week’s lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> While one qualified reader is to sum up all paragraphs during an evening (if no qualified brother except the study conductor is available, a sister may read), all in attendance should look up scriptures cited but not quoted. This will help all to become acquainted with Bible book locations and to handle the Scriptures effectively. Different ones may be called upon to read the scriptures and give appropriate comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Before closing the study and making field service announcements, study books may be closed while the conductor asks a few brief questions covering high lights of the evening. By having the lesson well studied, conductors will lead an enthusiastic, helpful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The congregation book study has a definite place in theocratic arrangements. Regularly attend it, and invite persons of good will as well as publishers not now attending to take advantage of Jehovah’s provision to learn more about the “new heavens and a new earth” at your weekly congregation book study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As we near the closing of the report, the Brooklyn factory has thus far received subscriptions from all parts of the world for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A wake!</span><span class="font5"> campaign to the total amount of 161,800.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By diligent work and Jehovah’s blessing upon our labor of love these new subscriptions were obtained in the one-month </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aivake! </span><span class="font5">campaign. By manifesting the same vigor, relying upon the same blessing and engaging in a well-organized four-month house-to-house campaign with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> January through April, what grand total of new subscriptions will result? Let us work and see 1</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark23"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Following the</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Circuit Servant’s Visit</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The benefits of the circuit servant’s visit to a congregation are realized not only during the week he is with the congregation. During the week of his visit publishers are taught and instructed in the best ways of performing the ministry. The weeks that follow his visit should see the things learned put into practice and should result in more effective witnessing. This emphasizes the importance of being alert during his visit and sharing in all the activities arranged, in order that we might ‘not be forgetful hearers but doers of the work.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> At the present time the circuit servant is spending much of his visit training publishers to do effective house-to-house preaching. He concentrates his attention on training and working with the more mature publishers so they in turn will be able to teach and train others in the congregation in the months to follow. Mature publishers assigned to work with less effective and irregular publishers should take the assignment seriously. The goal should be to eliminate irregularity in the service and have all become mature ministers. The training program established during his visit should be kept well organized under the congregation servant’s supervision. Each publisher should cooperate fully. Already the Society is receiving very encouraging reports as to the outstanding results achieved by this training program’s being used and by all publishers’ endeavoring to give three- to eightminute sermons at the doors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In addition to the training given</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font5">and think positively as you and the one you may be training offer the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The holiday week end, which begins Friday. January 1, starts the campaign. Many publishers, including those of school age, will have several days free. Why not make wise use of this time by devoting many hours to field service? Show those desiring life how to start the new year right. Obtain their subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and then follow through by personally helping them to choose the destiny of eternal life.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark28"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">in house-to-house preaching, the circuit servant gives good admonition from the platform. His talks encourage and edify the congregation and at the same time bring to the attention of all publishers the weaknesses that should be overcome, along with counsel for doing so. Servants should pay particular attention to these weaknesses and the counsel for overcoming them. However, the admonition is for all publishers. Everyone should make it his responsibility to do his part in improving the activity of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> At the end of his visit the circuit servant prepares a report on the condition of the congregation and sends it to the Society. A copy of it is left with the servants for future reference in working to overcome weaknesses that manifest themselves in the congregation. All servants should read the report and apply the counsel. Parts of the report might be used from time to time in developing parts on the service meeting as well as assisting in general congregation organization. On receiving the circuit servant’s report the .Society writes a personal letter of acknowledgment to the congregation and gives pertinent admonition and counsel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> By utilizing all the counsel received during the circuit servant’s visit and in the Society’s letter, the congregation is sure to improve and progress in its ministry. This is the desire of all members of the New World society, and we are thankful to Jehovah for so many provisions, such as the circuit servant’s visit, to keep us growing to maturity and preaching the good news more effectively^</span></p></li></ul>

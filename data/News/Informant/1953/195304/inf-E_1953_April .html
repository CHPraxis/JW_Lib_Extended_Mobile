<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Evidence of</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Maturity by the Spirit</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup>Love! Joy! Faith! These are fruits of the spirit, reflected in an efiicient, devoted and mature ministry with a constant increase of preachers of good news. Jehovah’s servants are ever alert to the necessity of working in harmony with his spirit, which means using his Word and following its righteous principles, directions and examples. Jehovah’s spirit is directing his people today. To conscientiously strive to Improve one’s personal ministry and advance in knowledge of the truth is to seek maturity by the spirit.—Heb. 6:1-3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> What a joy it is to see another new all-time peak of publishers in February! This second peak for 1953, coming in a short month, shows that publishers are striving for maturity. Can we go beyond 150,000 in April? A recent check of circuit assembly reports for the last six months in the United States indicates that there are more than 150,000 publishers associated with the companies. If all get out in April, we will easily go beyond our 20 per cent goal. Let each person who reads this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> ask himself whether he is mature enough to put forth some effort to publicly praise Jehovah during April. If he loves Jehovah, rejoices in the truth and has faith, what can stop him from manifesting these fruits by communicating his happiness to others? Nothing can stop him from preaching the good news!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> April has often been a peak month, and it is hoped that April 1953 will see a grand new peak of 150,000 or more publishers. It can be done, but much depends on the mature activity of each and every dedicated servant. You will rejoice to know that a total of 179,942 subscriptions were obtained in January and February. Did you share in this wonderful activity? You still have April left to take part in the 1953 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign. It simply means making up your mind to get out and witness from house to house. April can also be an alltime high subscription month if all servants demonstrate their maturity by publicly giving God praise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> We made an increase of 12.9 per cent in February. Will the April report show that we made the remaining 7.1 per cent? Do not forget to mark your company report card, “We made it!” if you reach the 20 per cent peak in April.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Where will I stay in New York?” is a question of major concern to each publisher. The matter can be cared for now by planning your requirements and returning the Room Request Form accompanying this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font5"> Fill out the form </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">completely</span><span class="font5"> after carefully considering the instructions attached to the form. These instructions should be reviewed at an early service meeting, as though they were part of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> so that all will be familiar with what is essential. It is far better to fill out and return the Room Request Form designating accommodation needs than to write a letter. Letter writing hinders assignments rather than facilitating them. Mail your room request to Watchtower Convention, 557 W. 157th Street, New York 32, N.Y.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The New York brothers will obtain thousands of rooms in private homes at moderate prices, &amp;s noted on the request form. When you write for a room in a private home, let it not be just as a safety measure in case you cannot find a place for yourself. When an assignment is received, be certain to stay in that home, for the householder is expecting you. In 1950 most brothers accepted assignments willingly and had rich blessings in witnessing April? Engage in house-to-house preaching; present the subscription offer enthusiastically; seek out every remaining avenue for helping others, Including those on whom we make back-calls and with whom we conduct Bible studies, by having them receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> during the coming year; encourage newly interested persons and publishers needing assistance to join with you in public praise; co-operate with the company organization to the full. Thus you will demonstrate a mature appreciation of Jehovah’s provisions and a desire to submit to the direction of his spirit in this time of the end.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">to persons of good will. Many who were householders in 1950 are now publishers as a result of the good impressions you made while staying in their homes. If you fail to show up for your room, the householder may regard all Jehovah’s witnesses as inconsiderate and irresponsible. Householders frequently go to considerable trouble furnishing rooms, postponing vacations, obtaining new linens, cleaning and painting to make your stay pleasant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> If you cannot possibly arrive on the day designated, be sure to notify the householder direct as to when you will arrive, even if it is the very next day. Bear in mind that it is primarily in the homes where a witness will be given and where so much good can be accomplished, so be considerate and thoughtful. If you prefer to look for your own accommodations when you get to New York, you may do so; but if the Watchtower Convention obtains a room at your request, please take it. Each request will be given individual attention in an endeavor to take the best care of your requirements.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The rooming department has quite a number of good hotel accommodations listed, although none are within walking distance of Yankee</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Increasing and Yielding Fruit’ </span><span class="font4">Increase of true worship is inevitable! Therefore we properly look for this increase and work for it. (Mark *:8; 2 Cor. 9:10, NW; Hab. 2:14) How do you view the 10 and 20 per cent goals? With faith and determination to do your part toward pushing the advance of true worship? It takes diligent work, as demonstrated </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">by the </span><span class="font4">“Yearbook” report from Haiti, where a 41 per cent increase was made in 1952. (178, 179, 180) Do you have the same zeal? Despite difficult conditions, Colombia made a 29 per cent increase in 1952. (133, 134)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Korea is making its contribution toward the expanding of true worship with tremendous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">increases in</span><span class="font4"> publishers, but it takes diligent work. (81) Has your company yet experienced the joy of expanding, as have the congregations in Bermuda and Hong Kong? (73, 186) Expansion must come for all healthy companies! Egypt has seen an increase of nearly 400 per cent in the last five years, but it took work. (150) What has been your increase over the last five years? Eastern Germany achieved a 33 per cent increase last year despite persecution. (170)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An increase in publishers does not necessarily result in a drop in service averages if maturity and regularity are properly stressed. The Gold Coast report illustrates this point. (32, 170, 171) Compare the United States’ report for January (11.7 per cent increase) with the December report and note the increase in averages too. Increase depends to a great extent on maturity of the brothers and active servant leadership in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Attending Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you decided to attend the world assembly? Are you weighing the matter carefully? When you consider the cost, do not forget the blessings! The brothers in British Honduras attend assemblies at great effort and expense. (115) Will you have to walk 440 miles to attend the assembly, as brothers in Northern Rhodesia are willing to do? (227, 228) Do you feel that financial circumstances simply will not permit you to attend? The brothers in Italy are very poor, too, but they put forth the effort to attend assemblies. (196) Perhaps you should </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reconsider and plan more</span><span class="font4"> carefully, though it may mean a sacrifice in other directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much depends on your appreciation for assemblies. Review the “Yearbook” account in the report from Tanganyika and ask yourself whether you appreciate assemblies as much as those brothers do. (231) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> work in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Northern</span><span class="font4"> Rhodesia is growing by leaps and bounds. Undoubtedly it is due, at least in part, to the great appreciation for, and support of, assemblies. (227)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not underestimate the effect of assemblies, both upon those who attend and upon those who observe, hear or read about such gatherings. The report from Nigeria illustrates the point. (224) Encourage good-will interest to attend. In St Helena a boy and his father attended an assembly, their first meeting of any kind, and the boy said, “It was not as if we were on St. Helena, but in another world.” Good results followed. (265)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In faraway Chile the brothers immediately determined to be represented at the world assembly. (130) Will your efforts match those of the Canadian brothers? (128) Will you be there?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>By Expanding Magazine Distribution</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Since Magazine Day was introduced in March 1949 magazines have been gradually replacing booklets. Companies were Instructed: “One day a week will be devoted to the distribution of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> on the streets, from house to house, store to store and in other ways.” Pioneers and company publishers supported Magazine Day activity. What has resulted? The English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> printing has Increased from 584,000 copies each issue to over 1,000,000 today: and the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">from 545,000 to over 800,000. Has Magazine Day been successful in carrying the good news to many thousands? Most assuredly. Splendid work is being done, Kingdom publishers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> However, there can be further expanding of magazine distribution, and all companies and individuals are invited to have a full share in this activity. Most companies are using Saturday for Magazine Day, with house-to-house or store-to-store work in the morning and street work in the afternoon and evening. If Saturday is not convenient, another day may be selected. Remember, too, store-to-store and house-to-house work, the main features of Magazine Day, may be done one day and street work another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers find that results of street work on Saturday afternoons are rather limited. Have you tried house-to-house distribution on Saturday afternoon? Might it not be that you will place more magazines at the homes than on the streets? Why not try it and compare results? Our object is to place magazines most effectively, and in your area working at the homes may be the way to do it Saturday afternoon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers, because it is not possible to get back to homes or stores every week, might find it advantageous to offer both </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> on a contribution of 10c. The two are readily placed on giving a short witness. Others have been successful in establishing routes with regular weekly visits, and these brothers may continue with such. However, when engaging in street work, feature only the latest copy of either magazine for 5c. (Both magazines may be carried, in the event they are needed.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Most companies have much house-to-house territory that is not frequently covered. Have you tried working some of this territory on Magazine Day with two magazines for 10c? Territory can be covered quickly and many magazines placed. The quick working of this territory with magazines can be co-ordinated and interchanged with the regular witnessing at other times so that no confusion results. Repeating on the same territory, perhaps in several months, offering two magazines again will result in placing many magazines. Rather than covering the same store area every week or two, why not branch out and include house-to-house territory? When completely covered with magazines it will be counted as a territory worked and should be marked as having been done with magazines. Territory and advertising servants can co-operate in arranging for working territory in this manner. Such magazine coverage should not interfere with the regular literature offer on Sunday and at other times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> It is suggested that company book study groups use magazines in house-to-house work before the study, offering a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for 10c. Why not let magazine work from house to house before the study be a regular part of the company book study arrangement? Many who cannot participate in Magazine Day activity will be able to share in magazine distribution through this arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Whether young in the truth or a seasoned publisher, Magazine Day activity is very enjoyable and an easy avenue of service. Regularly join in offering </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> from house to house and store to store. It will increase the flow of good news to millions of potential “other sheep”.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">The first demonstration below should be used as early as possible in April, possibly at the first service meeting. It supports striving for the 20 per cent peak. The second demonstration may be considered in connection with the notice on “1953 Vacation Pioneers’' on page four.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Worship in Holy Array’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (4 min.) Company servant talks about recent Memorial celebration. Attendance figures are compared with number of publishers. It is evident many who attended Memorial are in need of closer association with Jehovah’s organization to join in “holy array” worship. He covers what has been done, or can be done, since Memorial night to help these new ones. This calls for love on the part of mature servants, a desire to assist men of good will to right worship. (2 Ki. 10: 15-28) April will be a busy month, because all companies are working for the 20 per cent peak. It can be reached if all servants, publishers and pioneers encourage and help one another, as well as new persons. Survey is made of company’s potential to reach the 20 per cent peak. Cards are compared with number of publishers for January, February and March. How many were irregular, did not report each month? What can be done to assist them? That is the matter for the company to work out. It requires cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE 11 (7 min.) Assistant company servant raises his hand and is invited to come forward to tell what he is going to do during April. First, early in April, he will give each company book study conductor a list of publishers who did not get out in March. Then later on in April, between the 15th and 20th, another list will show all who have not turned in a report thus far for April. This will provide study conductors information with which to work. A company book study conductor then raises his hand and comes up to tell what he is going to do. On receiving the lists he will plan activity for his group, for he wants to do his part. He will be at contact point to take the lead and will call on and assist as many as he can. In fact, he makes clear this is to be done not only during April but every month, for it is his desire that all associated with his study become regular publishers. Regularity is important. (Heb. 13:15, NW) A mature publisher next puts his hand up and asks, “Brother, what can I do to assist?” He, too, is invited up and company book study conductor discusses with him how the two can work together and assist many. (Work in pioneers too, if you have them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE Hl (5 min.) Is this arrangement practical? Company servant interviews publishers who have been assisted in this manner. Those who have become strong relate how they now arrange time each month to be regular publishers and, having been assisted, desire to assist others.—Acts 20: 35; Rom. 15: 1, 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE IV (4 min.) Company servant admonishes all publishers to make extra effort during April and months to follow to help newly associated ones, Memorial attenders and those being studied with, to come into closer fellowship and join regularly in worshiping Jehovah in holy array. More than a report is desired, as pointed out in the March “Informant”. ‘Ministers for the issue' is our goal. Join in “holy array” worship during April and assist others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Vacation Pioneering</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (6 min.) Opens with publisher who has been assigned to prepare talk on vacation pioneering. He is talking out loud as he looks over and reviews material he has selected and prepared thus far. Before him are April 1, 1950, “Watchtower” and April 1951 “Informant”, etc. Quoting excerpts from “More and More Pioneers of Good News”, he proceeds to review briefly points covered in article dealing with urgency of times, reasons Society issues call for more pioneers. He remembers example set by Christ Jesus; recalls others. Then he relates conditions and requirements for entry, just who is urged to take up pioneer work and what must be considered before taking up pioneer work. Also discusses how divine support is forthcoming, how Jehovah provides and delivers. Next comes the matter of youthful publishers who can and will be pioneers, how they can be assisted and the benefits that come from doing this most favored work. Increases are noted in number of vacation pioneers: 1950, 858; 1951, 1,256; 1952, 1,807. What will it be in 1953? How many will come from our com-€any? To help them, perhaps it would e well to have an interview of some who were successful vacation pioneers or are prospective vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE It (4 mtn.) Same person is seen talking to ones selected for interview and is rehearsing with them. (Here companies that have not had any vacation pioneers may interview any who contemplate taking it up this year, or, if none, interview regular pioneers.) A series of short questions may be propounded which will permit material in Scene I to be highlighted by answers given in person’s own words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (5 min.) In closing, brother will ask vacation pioneers to relate experiences demonstrating blessings that come from this field of service. (If none locally, use “Yearbook”, pages 67, 96, 158, 234.) In conclusion he points out that such experiences can be the lot of those who can put in more time as pioneers. Then in summary he outlines who can enter this work: young and old, boys and girls, men and women, yes, housewives too. All are encouraged to try vacation pioneering. Vacation pioneer requirements: 1. Must be immersed, 2. Publisher for six months (before or after immersion), 3. Devote at least two months. How can this be done with a world assembly coming up in July? By planning now, starting early, striving for maximum of hours from very beginning. Many schools close in the last part of May, thus giving all of June, July and August. It can be done, and it is worth the effort. Will we have more vacation pioneers in 1953? The answer lies with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The servants of Jehovah God enjoy a special relationship to him. (1 John 4:16, ATI<sup>7</sup>) From the perfect example set by Jehovah himself we learn how to manifest our love to others, by making known his way. All devoted servants may demonstrate that they appreciate God’s loving way by taking part in the activity arranged for May.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> A booklet campaign will be carried on by all companies and pioneers, and effort will be made to place the oldest booklets first. Combinations may be made up with any booklets in stock: ten booklets for 15 cents; five for 10 cents; or two for 5 cents. Appropriate wrappers for five- or ten-booklet combinations are being sent with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font5">Five wrappers may be given to each company publisher who will use them, and the remaining ones should be divided equally among the pioneers working with the company. In most instances this will give pioneers quite a few more than five.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">Last year there were more than 1,800 vacation pioneers enrolled. Many are wondering about the arrangement this year, in view of the world assembly. The Society encourages all persons who can do so to enter the ranks of vacation pioneers this summer. Doubtless some can start as early as June 15, or perhaps June 1. If you can start early, so much the better. If you can start July 1 and pioneer for July and August, we invite you to send for a pioneer application blank. In other words, all those who wish to pioneer this summer are welcome to do so, even though the world as-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(Part 1)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Leadership initiates with Jehovah and his King-Son, Christ Jesus. To servants in the congregations the charge Is given, “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God.” (Acts 20:28, AW) Overseers are thus charged with leadership and, because so much depends upon their diligence, enthusiasm and example, they cannot neglect to perform their duties without its resulting in hurt to the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> To the extent that servants in a congregation work together, organize for the ministry in harmony with the Society’s instructions, and take the lead in preaching activity, to this same extent will Jehovah bless the activity of the congregation. Progress and theocratic increase will result. Making field service arrangements and preparing constructive and educational meetings are important, but are really only part of a servant’s leadership. When it is time to engage in the preaching work, he should be at the Kingdom Hall or home meeting place on time. After the text is discussed and prayer offered, servants (including study conductors) should execute well-planned arrangements for giving assistance to those needing help. Territory lined up ahead of time will be entered promptly and all publishers will be encouraged to stay in the field at least two hours for house-to-house witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The servant rendering assistance to the congregation does so with Christian love and sincere concern. He knows that ‘all that has breath must praise Jehovah’ to have his favor and everlasting life. Mere-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">sembly comes in July. You will still be able to devote much time to field service and a great deal can be accomplished. Send for your application now, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">stating that yon wish to enroll as a vacation pioneer.</span><span class="font5"> Fill it out completely, sign it and then return it immediately with a letter of recommendation giving your service activity for the past six months. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Act now to avoid delay.</span><span class="font5">__</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Guard Against Pretenders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Reports persist that persons pretending to be in the truth visit companies to borrow money and pass bad checks. This notice is published so that brothers may be on guard against such persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ly coming to meetings, though necessary, is not all that is required. So he wants all to be regular in expressing their faith and devotion by preaching in the field. Hence, definite arrangements are made for all to share. The assistant company servant should check his records twice a month, about the 1st and the 15th, to find out who did not publish during the previous month and who have not been out during the present month, and who otherwise need help because of low service activity. A list of these should be made and furnished to appointed study conductors so they and other mature brothers can give needed assistance to irregular publishers in house-to-house activity and otherwise. This way you will help irregular publishers early in the month and again later. Thus we see that conducting the study is only part of a company book study conductor’s responsibility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> This help is not to be rendered in a cold, unfriendly way, nor in a manner that will embarrass brothers. Efficient leadership in organization does not mean this at all. Rather, in a loving and considerate way each one’s particular problems and obstacles can be given attention. Sometimes they may be more fancied, than real, but the servant can help each one to overcome these by regular encouragement and by pointing out the responsibilities resting upon all Jehovah’s people to publish the good news regularly. Prove yourself to be a real servant of your brothers, for “you must assist those who are weak and must bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’ ”—Acts 20: 35, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p></li></ul>

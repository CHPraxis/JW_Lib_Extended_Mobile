<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">All Arrangements Should Be in Final Form</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Wear Badges En Route</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup>By now all congregations and individuals should know exactly what they are going to do relative to attendance at the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Attention and interest are being focused on New York. Arrangements at the convention city are being carefully and diligently completed so that you will be able to enjoy all the assembly. Are you carefully planning your personal matters to take full advantage of the assembly? Make notes now of the little things that will be necessary for full and comfortable participation in the assembly, so that you do not forget them at the last minute.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Have you decided on appropriate clothing for warm weather? and work clothes for your volunteer service assignment? Are you prepared to witness en route to and from the convention? Take literature, especially magazines and tracts, for this purpose. Do not forget to wear your convention badge from the time you leave home, for these will prompt questions en route and furnish opportunities to witness to others. Badges should not be worn in New York city until one week before the convention. Will your car sign be firmly fixed in a conspicuous place? Will you have your room assignment card? Yes, make notes now of the things to be done just before you leave. Also, bear in mind the points set out below.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The rooming work is progressing well in New York and there will be plenty of private home accommodations for everyone, at reasonable rates. If you do not receive your room assignment before you leave home, do not let it worry you. You can pick it up at the Rooming Department at convention headquarters, 557 West 157th Street, up to and including July 17 and from the 18th on at the Rooming Department under the bleacher section of the stadium, 161st Street and River Avenue. If you have not forwarded</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">a Room Request form, do so now. We can still take care of your needs, though you may have to obtain your assignment in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Many of the brothers are sending in their volunteer service applications, and in this way are aiding the convention to organize the work. Why not plan to join them in this labor of love by sending in your volunteer service application now. When you receive notice of your assignment to definite duty, stick to it and be dependable, rendering service as to Jehovah.</span></p></li>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembling with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">New World Society</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be a Publisher in July</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people never tire of assembling together. In accord with Jehovah’s command at Hebrews 10: 25, members of the New World society assemble at the Kingdom Hall for instruction and counsel several times each week, and periodically they gather for circuit and district assemblies. But this month, in addition to these regular meetings, all members of the New World society who can possibly do so will assemble at Yankee Stadium in New York for the greatest of modern Christian gatherings. Distance, age, station in life, color, language —none of these things will interfere with the personal attendance by all who can arrange to travel to New York.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> With assembly dates being July 19 to 26, most publishers will leave their home territory between the 10th and 18th to arrive in New York at the proper time. Therefore each one will have at least the first ten days of July at home before leaving for the assembly. Proper planning will enable all within the congregation to have part in field service, so that every publisher can turn in a report before leaving home. day, July 26, will be tremendous. The greater the number of helpers, the lighter the task. Why not plan to stay Sunday night and Monday after the assembly and aid in this v. ork? Be sure to have appropriate clothing with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> In addition to witnessing en route, each associate of the New World society will be sure to include field service in his schedule in New York. Let us all add to the witness given to New Yorkers by continuing to be regular house-to-house preachers at the assembly. The current offer of three books and three booklets, on a contribution of $1.50, will be used at the assembly. A good supply of literature will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font5"> 2, coZ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Three books with three booklets, on a $1.50 contribution, will continue to be the offer. Did you place one set during June? Make that your goal again this month. Time in the field will result in placements, which, in turn, will lay a foundation for giving assistance to people who may later join in assembly with Jehovah’s people and walk in the way that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Circumstances may not permit some associated with the New World society to assemble at Yankee Stadium. If that is your lot, bear in mind that Jehovah knows your heart’s desire to be with his people. Your brothers at the assembly will endeavor to keep you posted of convention high lights. Regular meetings and field work, arranged by the congregation servant in accord with local conditions, will be supported by those remaining home. This will enable them to keep busy In Kingdom activity and will be a source of blessing to those at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> En route to and from New York, as well as during the assembly, a mighty witness will be given as publishers utilize all opportunities to preach. Take literature with you for incidental witnessing en route. Do </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font5"> j, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">available at the stadium, as well as at the other contact points at Kingdom Halls throughout the city. For further Information about field service and location of the contact point nearest you, see the June </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Traffic and Parking</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Many thousands of persons will use every means of transportation to assemble with the New World society at Yankee Stadium. Room requests show 70 per cent will be coming by automobile. It is much better to allow plenty of time to travel than to wait until the last minute and depend on breakneck speeds to arrive on time. Slow down I Drive carefully!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Upon arriving In New York city, watch traffic and parking signs. Parking regulations are strictly enforced. There are many one-way streets, and these should especially be watched. If you need directions in addition to those given you at the Society’s information booths (see June </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> for locations), it is best to ask a policeman. They are always courteous and helpful. The police department has suggested that, to avoid theft, cars should be locked at all times and valuables should never be left visible inside.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> There is very limited parking space near Yankee Stadium. That which is available is run by commercial garages and parking lots. These are quite expensive, generally $1 a day. If you patronize these garages or lots, check to see If the price covers twenty-four hours or If there is an extra charge after a certain time limit. Prices and time periods are posted, and these signs should be noted carefully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Most hotels and private home accommodations are easily accessible to Yankee Stadium by subway. With a ten-cent fare, you will appreciate that it is by far the cheapest, and it will generally be the fastest method of transportation. In harmony with this point, many will wish to park their car for the eight days of the assembly and ride the subway. For those who wish to park their car off the street during the assembly, arrangements are being made with a large open-air parking lot about three miles from the stadium. The cost will be approximately $3 for the eight or ten days, representing quite a saving over parking near the stadium. Parking tickets can be obtained at the Parking Department of the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Buses</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Arrangements have been made with the police department for parking buses on the street during the assembly. The location for bus parking is Baychester Avenue between Glvan</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;"><img src="inf-E_1953_July _files/inf-E_1953_July -1.png" alt="" style="width:288pt;height:49pt;">

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>En Route to</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>and from the Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">i By automobile, by bus, by plane, by train, by ship—yes, by all modes of travel, Jehovah’s witnesses in July will be converging upon New York city from all directions. Time will be consumed in travel, both to and from the convention, but will there not be opportunities to witness on the way? Yes, by all means!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2 Traveling by auto there will be stops at service stations, motels, restaurants, etc. Perhaps you could begin your conversation to the manager of a motel this way: “We’re on our way to Yankee Stadium, New York city, to attend the world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. Over 100,000 pebple will be coming from all parts of the world and will assemble for eight days to receive instruction from the Scriptures and enjoy the fellowship of one another. All are looking forward to the time when God’s new world will be established and there will be peace and prosperity in the earth. Here are three books that Jehovah’s witnesses are presenting to help others to learn of this new world and its blessings. By studying them carefully, you will learn that the hope of living in a new world of God’s making is not some utopian dream, but belief in the true promise of God. [Demonstrate the features of each and show their helpfulness<sup>-</sup> in understanding God’s purposes.] The three, including these three booklets, can be had for a contribution of $1.50.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3 Then there will be the times you will stop for meals or other needed items. Without seeming to impose upon them, speak to attendants, managers and waiters at appropriate times. You might begin this way: “I know you are busy and I do not wish to take up your time, but here is a tract which I am sure you will enjoy reading very much. It discusses our need of the Bible in these difficult times. Read it over carefully and I’m sure it will deepen your appreciation for the good things contained in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and Gun Hill Road. After unloading on 161st Street near River Avenue at the stadium, buses should proceed as follows: From Yankee Stadium turn left (north) on RiverAvenue to 167th Street. Turn right (east) on 167th Street to Webster Avenue. At Webster Avenue turn left (north) and proceed to Fordham Road. Turn right (east) on Fordham Road to Boston Road, then left (north) on Boston Road to Baychester Avenue. Then turn right (east) on Baychester Avenue to the parking location between Givan and Gun Hill Road.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Definite arrangements for bus departure after the assembly are important to all in the group. Each bus will have a brother acting as captain of the group, and every group will have decided where to meet for departure after the assem-</span><span class="font3">Scriptures.” (After these few words, you will be able to observe whether it would be fitting to extend your witness. If interest is shown and the person is not busy at the moment, you can continue your brief discussion.) Latest copies of the magazines can also be used in this manner. Be sure to take along a supply.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">4 While traveling by public transportation facilities, there will be times you can talk to fellow passengers. Almost everyone w<sup>T</sup>ill agree we are living in serious times; why not use this as an opening? To the person sitting next to you, who has just finished reading of calamity and w’oe in the newspaper, you might say: “It certainly seems that times are getting worse and worse, doesn’t it? If a person does not have hope that God will take a hand in matters and soon restore sanity to the world, he has every reason to expect only a very bleak future. But, you know, Jehovah God has not purposed that these conditions should continue forever, nor is he responsible for them. In fact the very worsening of world affairs is an indication that we have reached the time for ushering in his new world of righteousness. How about reading over this little tract on God's new world and let me know what you think about it?” Later you will be able to take up various points raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5 One opportunity for witnessing that definitely should not be neglected is the time we will be able to talk to the householders where we are staying in New York. This should be done in addition to regular field witnessing. In the evenings after coming home from the stadium or in the mornings before leaving, there will be much to talk about and many questions to answer. Bring them to the stadium during the week. Whet their appetites for the grand climax to come on the closing day, when the public talk will be delivered. Invite them; yes, help them to attend and enjoy some of the blessings of the New World society. Be sure to report the time spent witnessing to your home congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">bly. In view of the program schedule, it would be appropriate to arrange for your departure sometime after 9 p.m. Sunday evening. The proper place to load for departure will be 161st Street near River Avenue. Patience will be required, as all cannot load and depart simultaneously. If care is taken to arrange your departure details ahead of time, no difficulty will be encountered. Those in each group should realize that their brothers are waiting for them, and they should be on time at the designated location. The Society is writing a letter of instructions to each congregation that submitted a Chartered Bus questionnaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Taxicabs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The first demonstration below emphasizes showing appreciation and kind consideration of others at the world assembly, so that no disturbance interferes with enjoyment of the assembly. The second demonstration deals with parental responsibility toward children in connection with the assembly. Consider both demonstrations before leaving for New York.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE 1 (3 min.) At Yankee Stadium two publishers are sitting side by side listening to lecture. Daisy nudges Mabel, saying, “Mabel, Mabel! There's Jane sitting over there. You know, we have not seen her in three years. Det’s go over and say hello right now, because if we wait we will lose her in the crowd.” Mabel: “Sh-sh-sh-sh.” She tries to quiet Daisy and at the same time continue her own interest in the lecture. But Daisy says, “Well, if you are not going, I am anyway.” This scene is accompanied by waving and gesticulating by Daisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE li (5 min.) Conductor points out commotion that was caused by Daisy and Mabel, disturbing those nearby. Finally Daisy reaches the section where Jane is sitting and goes through the same upsetting procedure of making people stand while she squeezes past to reach Jane. Then they carry on quite a conversation about not having seen one another for three years and what has been happening in each other’s life. Having lost the entire theme of the lecture by this time, and feeling it is about over anyway, Jane suggests they get up and head for the cafeteria. If they do not there will be such a crowd they will miss out on their meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An attendant sitting nearby and observing the entire disturbing commotion reminds them of the Society’s suggestion that publishers remain in their seats, quietly paying attention until the program is finished, rather than be in a big hurry to get to the cafeteria. He reminds them there will be plenty for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jane begins to understand and show’s remorse about the entire episode and the fact that she caused so much disturbance. From now on she is determined to be mindful of not only her own comfort and desires, but also those of persons near her. In the meantime the meeting is dismissed and Daisy says, “You know, I think it is a good idea to remain in our seats for ten or fifteen minutes until the big rush is over. We can be comfortable and this will give us an opportunity to finish our little visit.” Time goes by quickly, and a half hour has elapsed. They are now ready to leave ana enjoy their meal at the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (7 min.) Conductor summarizes by bringing out the points in July 1, 1953, “Watchtower” article “Showing Appreciation at Assemblies”. Mabel, Daisy, Jane and everybody in their vicinity would have profited by applying these suggestions. There would be no running around during sessions, no leaving before sessions are ended. Rather, there would be careful attention by all, making the assembly enjoyable and profitable to the full. (In summary, do not go beyond the subheading “Supervising Conduct of Children” in the “Watchtower” article, as this applies to the next demonstration.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (3 min.) Conductor gives brief talk about trip to convention, showing need for planning in every way. Condition of the family car, routes to be taken, economy, clothes, literature—all these things must be considered. But trip offers wonderful educational opportunities too. Children must get the most out of the trip in every way, en route and at the convention. Scenic and historic spots along the way will contribute toward education, but attention must be given to children at the assembly itself. They must be well-mannered and attentive to what is going on; and it is up to the parents to make this assembly a lasting impression on the child’s mind and to look after him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (8 min.) Father, mother and two children sit at table with maps, notebook and copy of July 1, 1953, “Watchtower.” They discuss routes to be taken and points of interest to be seen; what must be done to the car: what clothes they will take, etc. Children speak up and say what a good time they are going to have running around underneath the stadium stands, and around the cafeteria tents. They can even play games by running from one side of the stadium to the other in the stands. But father says “No !” There Is something more important for them to do, which is the reason for going all the way to New York. The way children act at -an .assembly is the way the parents let the children behave in their own Kingdom Hall. Bad children bring a reflection on the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He takes out July 1 “Watchtower” and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">turns to article “Showing</span><span class="font3"> Appreciation at Assemblies”, the subheading “Supervising Conduct of Children”. A discussion ensues between father and mother, and with children, bringing out various points in “Watchtower” article. Some parts are read. The children are shown the reasonableness of the points made; how it will help them to become better servants of Jehovah; and how their conforming to the conduct outlined will help everyone else enjoy the convention. Parents must instruct children and then back up that instruction with firm supervision of their conduct. There will be plenty to see and hear anywhere in the stadium. Here is where the really lasting impressions must be made on the child’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (4 min.) Father and mother, toward the latter part of the convention, are discussing success they have had in properly caring for their children They took them along wherever they went; had them sitting quietly during meetings; did not permit them to disturb others by running around or continually going in and out. They make mention of how busy this kept them, but the fruits of their labors have been well rewarded by noticing the benefits the children have received by paying close attention to lectures. Father remarks, “I never before realized the importance of keeping a close check on our children rather than permitting them to run at random.” He recalls the advice of “The Watchtower” that “the greatest heritage one can leave his children is the desire to become an active minister to Jehovah”. To this end, these faithful parents appreciate the importance of seeing that their children get all they can out of the convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On and after September 6, 1953, circuit servants will speak on the subject “Happiness in a World of Gloom”. At the same time district servants will start giving the talk entitled “What Is Your Destiny?” Please order handbills accordingly.</span></p>

There is no charge for ordinary suitcases that you take in the cab with you; however, there is an extra charge of 50 cents for each trunk. If the driver puts baggage in the cab trunk, or on the back carrier provided for that purpose, a tip is expected. Do not ride with the driver with the understanding that he is to take you to your destination for a flat rate, not using the meter, as this is illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Registration</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Meal tickets will be provided for pioneers who were on the list before January 1, 1953, and they may obtain such tickets at convention headquarters (557 West 157th Street) up to and Including July 17. From the 18th on they will be available under the bleacher section of the stadium, near the Rooming Department. If you lose your meal ticket, no other will be issued. Meal tickets should be considered just as though they were money, and treated as such. The meal ticket will also serve as identification for obtaining literature at pioneer rates. Those who entered pioneer service on or after January 1, 1953, must have their pioneer territory assignment card or pioneer appointment letter (in the case of vacation pioneers) in order to obtain campaign literature at pioneer rates at the convention. They will not receive a meal ticket, however.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Programs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> While there will be a good supply of programs, please do not ask for a new program every day of the assembly. Keep your program with you at all times for reference to sessions and as a guide around the stadium. It will be a permanent souvenir of the assembly too. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Do not lose your program!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">First Aid</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Do not forget that this department is set up </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only for first aid or emergency eases.</span><span class="font5"> No chronic cases will be treated by the doctors present.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Some make a habit of leaving their seats before the session is over, to avoid the crowd. This greatly interferes with those who desire to obtain all the spiritual food presented. Regardless of the motive for doing so, such as to be first in line at the cafeteria or to get to the subway before the crowd, it certainly does not justify the inconvenience and lack of consideration shown others. There will be few compelling reasons for leaving in the evening before a concluding prayer of thanks to Jehovah. If you come to obtain the greatest amount of benefit from the assembly. you will not be found milling around the passageways and outside the stadium during sessions. To facilitate smooth, orderly operation of the assembly, please follow directions of the attendants.

<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Spiritually stimulated as a result of the New World Society Assembly, all publishers will be anxious to go to work. As August will end the 1953 service year, let us make it a very good month. Everyone should be alert and alive with the spirit of the assembly. The New World society is moving forward! Its King rules! There is much work to be done! Servants, take the lead in giving, with love for all. Regular and vacation pioneers, determine to exceed your service quota in August. With cooperation on the part of all, August could be the best month of our service year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Did you enjoy working toward the 10 and 20 per cent increases in 1953? Of course you did. Do you want to have further share in giving to others? We are certain you-do. Then move ahead with Jehovah’s organization during August and continue to experience the greater happiness of giving.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> You will be interested in knowing that the factory at 117 Adams Street and the Bethel home at 124 Columbia Heights, in Brooklyn, will be open for visitors from Monday through Wednesday following the assembly, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You are invited to visit Gilead, also WBBR's transmitter site on Staten Island, before or after the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah's servants worship him “in holy array” in this great day of his vindication. Such worship marks them apart from any other people on the face of the earth, a people for his praise. As a part of the New World society, let your convention activity and decorum contribute to the great praise that will reflect upon Jehovah's name because of this assembly. (Take this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant to New</span><span class="font5"> York with you.)</span></p>

And do not forget, if you will not return home before the end of July, to be sure to send your complete field service report to your congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Do you have in mind caring for all details before you leave for the world assembly? You will care for your home and see that gas, water and electricity are turned off; that doors and windows are locked, and plants, pets and livestock left behind are properly provided for. Are you going to give the same thought to theocratic interests left behind?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Servants, will you provide for publishers and people of good will who cannot get to the assembly? Will you arrange for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, service meeting and ministry school where they are required and can be operated, even if in modified form? Will someone take oversight of field activity and receive service reports, so that everyone will be a publisher in July? Field service should continue on the part of those who remain at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Remember that congregation correspondence, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> and magazines will continue to arrive while you are gone. Arrange for someone to take care of these matters so that material will not be returned to the Society. Magazines should be distributed to those who can use them. It might be well to mention to your postman that you will be gone a short while and that you have arranged to have your mail cared for. If you are expecting a literature shipment from the Society, leave definite instructions showing how this should be handled so that costly storage charges will not be incurred.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Check carefully on all details and see that everything is in order before you depart for New York.</span></p></li></ul>

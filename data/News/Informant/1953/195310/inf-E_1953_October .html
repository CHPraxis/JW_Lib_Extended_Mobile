<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Asleep In the deep night of the old world are many millions of persons who have no knowledge of God’s Word of truth. And the same is true of the vast majority of mankind today when it comes to knowing the facts behind what goes on in the world. These persons need the truth, which will act as an alarm clock to awaken and alert them to world conditions and the cause and remedy for universal distress. It is the privilege of New World society members to actively serve in awakening the sleepers from their slumber. Everlasting sleep awaits them if they are not aroused now and helped to favorable new-world activity.—Eph. 5:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> During October, to make the offer of a one-year subscription on a contribution of $1 even more attractive, three booklets will be given free. Publishers will remit 90 cents for each new subscription. With such an excellent and varied magazine as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! to offer, it should </span><span class="font5">not be very difficult for each congregation publisher to obtain at least one subscription, and pioneers, four. In the campaign last year United States publishers, 132,640 of them, obtained 107,394 subscriptions. Now, with approximately 150,000 publishers, how many subscriptions do you think will be taken? Shall we be able to make it an all-time peak? Last year, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we increased our hours in the field and rose well above the previous peak of 78,888 subscriptions set in October of 1950. Over 28,500 more! Will we do better this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Start Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> We can and will if each publisher will get off to a good start this year. Yes, hit it hard right from October 1, right from the very first door we call on, and keep stressing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> down to the last day of the month. Engage in house-to-house ministry every Sunday, and offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> at every door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Be familiar with the magazine’s contents and thus use the awakening message most effectively. In this way more and more people will become acquainted with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and be alerted by its enlightening and eye-opening features. Use the material found in its pages, which you enjoy so much, to arouse the interest of the person to whom you are presenting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Phrase the points found in it in your own words and see the effect as you enthusiastically and convincingly present it. Remember, you will have two issues to work with this month, designed to appeal to all persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Do we not feel and know that the old world needs to have an alarm sounded? Are not world conditions such that they practically shout aloud the sadly neglected condition of the people? Why not obey the command to “awaken the sleepers” by helping them to meet, see, obtain and read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and appreciate its full value. Offer it to everyone and at every opportunity. Help them to awaken and see the light of the new-world day that leads to life. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is a valuable stimulant for a drowsy world. Use it to best advantage during October.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Keeping the Goal in View</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">This is October, the second month of the new service year. Remember that our goal each year is to achieve a 10 per cent average increase by the end of December, and a 20 per cent peak by the end of April. This increase is to be based upon the previous year’s average number of publishers. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we reached this goal last year. It will require effort and planning on the part of all servants and publishers if we are going to do so this year. Keep the goal in view! Let everyone be a house-to-house preacher!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Circuit Assemblies Resume</span></h2>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Everyone to Attend and Support</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> With memories of the New World Society Assembly still fresh in mind, Jehovah’s people look forward to another progressive year of theocratic activity. Yes, the long-looked-for and prayed-for world assembly has come and gone, but the blessings imparted there will reach over many years to strengthen and enlighten those who love and serve Jehovah. Assembling together is indeed a provision from Jehovah and we appreciate his loving care in this regard. We were thankful to learn that circuit assemblies throughout the country would resume shortly after the world assembly. Assembly blessings will therefore continue to be enjoyed regularly by Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Last February the circuits in the United States were revamped to keep pace with the expansion of true worship. This will mean, in most cases, getting acquainted with publishers in congregations that were formerly a part of other circuits ; but we are all one happy family, and it does not take Jehovah’s witnesses long to get acquainted when assembling and working together in holy array. So, when the circuit assembly for your circuit is announced, make definite plans to attend and share in the many blessings. Remember, it is your assembly. Participate to the full and make it a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Engage in Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Likewise, in attending the assembly, do not forget that field service is an integral part of each circuit assembly. During each assembly, immediately put to good use the practical instruction you receive from the platform on house-to-house witnessing. You do not have to wait until you return home to make practical application of the information that you receive. There will be house-to-house and store-to-store witnessing as well as advertising to be done. You will receive much more from the assembly if you share in the field service. Sunday morn-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, coil. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">•with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Clean Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear.” (2 Cor. 7: 1, NW) Members of the New World society are careful to conform to the high standards, both moral and spiritual, that Jehovah sets forth in his Word. (102)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Yearbook” report from Costa Rica shows that there is real pleasure and blessing in bringing one’s course of living into harmony with Jehovah’s requirements. (136) There must be firmness on the part of the organization in aiding newly associated persons to see and meet these requirements, so that the spiritual health of the congregations is not impaired by contamination with old-world standards. (155) And yet there should be a kindly spirit of helpfulness in dealing with persons who are just learning of the new world and who need assistance in these matters. (179)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If anyone feels that his problems are too great to be straightened out, refer to the report from Nicaragua and see how Jehovah blessed the action taken by individual brothers in that land. (222)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We should never conclude that holding to the Bible standards will in any way retard the growth of the organization. Rather, just the opposite will be true, as shown by the report from Mexico. (211, 213) In Chile the determination to hold close to Jehovah’s standards did not hinder progress at all last year. (129) Jehovah blesses those individuals and congregations that practice clean worship. It is the only worship that has his approval. —Also see comments on pages 121, 200, 235 and 246.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Suffering for Righteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“For if someone because of conscience toward God bears up under afflictions and suffers unjustly, this is a thing agreeable with God.” (1 Pet. 2: 19-25, NW) This means following the example and course of Christ Jesus, which is the way of gaining Jehovah’s approval. Consider the report from Cyprus and see how our brothers there continue undaunted by violent persecution. (142, 143)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When one appreciates the great issue now before all creation and he understands that reproach from the Devil’s old world is to be expected, then he is not dismayed and discouraged by such experiences. He realizes that, in the long run, such works beneficially to himself and others of good will who observe his stand for what is right.—See the report from Dominican Republic, pages 146 and 147.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even in violent, false-religious strongholds persecution of Jehovah's servants brings the great issue to the fore and causes many honest ones to make a right choice. It is certainly so in Greece today, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding. (175) It must be borne in mind that opposition in modern times does not always mean “goat,” as it did not mean so in the case of Saul of Tarsus. (220, 221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is true, as in the days of the early church, that heated opposition that scatters our brothers often means a wider witness is given. And the courageous attitude of God’s servants in standing firm against satanic villainy sometimes moves to theocratic action those who have long stood on the sidelines and watched. (249)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> To obtain subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> one must be able to convince open-minded people that this journal is what they need and want. Familiarity with the contents and enthusiastic presentations are therefore very essential. For example, a publisher might introduce himself as engaged in a world-wide Bible educational program, and then continue to this effect:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> &quot;As you know, there are hundreds of magazines and periodicals covering the newsstands that deal with fiction or are filled with the opinions and philosophies of men. Such material does nothing to improve the lot of the people in a way that really counts. But </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is constructive and forward-looking, and it deals with facts that are not only interesting but also vital to new-world living. It is a journal for serious-thinking persons, yet it is not lacking in human interest. Above all, it will acquaint you with the most important truth you could possibly learn, concerning the establishment of God’s kingdom for the blessing of persons who desire and look forward to a world much better than the present one in which we live. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> will show you how the happenings of these times were foretold in the Bible and why they presage a new world now at hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is interested in keeping you alert and alive to the vital issues of the day. A subscription for one year is only $1, and these three booklets are given free.” Then the publisher</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Assemblies Resume </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font5">ing has been reserved for house-to-house activity on the part of all, so that all publishers can begin immediately to apply the good points on house-to-house ministry presented at the Saturday night activity meeting. Bring sufficient magazines and literature with you and have a full share in house-to-house and other witnessing activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Since circuit assembly locations are usually not too far from each congregation in the circuit, why not make it a special point to take persons of good will with you to the assembly? Have them attend the baptismal discourse Saturday afternoon to get acquainted with dedimight select the article </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Is Thirty-four” (10/8 issue) or another good article and discuss it briefly, at the same time demonstrating the journal’s features.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Do not forget renewals on subscriptions taken last year. The Bible study servant will transfer to slips the names and addresses of last year’s subscribers (from S-10 sheets) and give these to congregation book study conductors for the publishers. Following is a suggested way of approach to encourage subscribers to renew.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> “Last year we were happy to include your name with hundreds of thousands of other subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine. I hope you have enjoyed the articles presented in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> The valuable information in just a few issues is worth the small cost of the subscription. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">subscribers are usually anxious to renew their subscriptions so as not to miss an issue, although sometimes the rush and bustle of daily life causes persons to overlook the renewal notice in the magazine. Our records show that your subscription is about to expire [or has expired] and I would like to assist you in extending it for another year. The subscription rate is still the same, only $1 for 24 issues. I can take your renewal right now and save you the trouble of writing.” If a renewal is obtained, there may be sufficient interest to have in mind a later return visit and a home Bible study. Do not overlook this possibility.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">cation responsibilities, and perhaps they will symbolize their dedication to do Jehovah's will. Of course, Sunday’s activity will be of particular interest to good-will persons, and arrangements should be made well in advance to help them attend on this day, if they are unable to take advantage of the entire assembly. By your attending every day of the assembly and assisting others to attend, the benefits of the circuit assembly will reach even more persons. Utilize its practical and timely instruction to the full as you worship Jehovah in holy array.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The first demonstration below features the presentation of “Awake!” The second demonstration illustrates the use of “Make Sure of All Things” in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">house-to*house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (4 min.) </span><span class="font2">Chairman discusses “Awake!” campaign, using issues of “Informant” of past few years to show what was accomplished. He stresses point that dignity of message requires clean, neat dress and thorough preparation of presentation. Lasting impressions are made by first contact of witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (4 min.) Neat, clean, friendly-looking publisher is seen approaching door. Businesslike, his presentation in mind, he prepares to meet householder. Rings bell, waits patiently and then cheerfully greets householder as door opens: “Good morning. I’m Mr. ---, and I’m calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">on the people who are interested in improving their understanding of world conditions and seeing more peaceful times on earth. As an honest-hearted person, I am sure you would like to see a righteous world, wouldn’t you?” Householder responds favorably. Publisher continues: “I have found a magazine that gives much information along such lines and I would like you to see it. ‘Awake’’ is the name and it costs only $1 a year.” He produces latest copy and begins to point out how “Awake!” constantly supplies important information concerning world conditions and directs people to God’s Word for hope. To housewives it appeals with articles on food, sewing and fashions; for students, articles on science, medicine, geography and history; for everyone, stories on the wonderful things of nature and interesting customs of other peoples “But we have so many magazines we will not be able to read, it,” householder objects. Publisher tactfully shows that “Awake!” takes little time to read, yet, unlike the great majority of other magazines, offers real hope. Householder subscribes. After publisher leaves she is heard remarking on courtesy, neatness and intelligent presentation of witness. She will look forward to receiving “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (4 min.) Publisher is shown just concluding his weekly study with a family group. Speaking to head of the home, he asks, “Did you read the article on ‘Hypnotism’ in the last copy of ‘Awake!’ I left you?” Whlen a negative answer is received, publisher quickly brings out his copy and points out that hypnotism through conditioning can be used to induce persons to commit crimes; that confessions have been gained by the Communists through hypnotism and that it can otherwise serve the schemes of evil men. Husband and wife quickly recognize value of knowing this. Wife then mentions that she appreciated information on ineffectiveness of chlorophyll products in same issue. Schoolboy son mentions he likes “Watching the World,” ‘because it makes it easy to gather news for the current events part of his history class.’ Publisher then brings out other copies to display articles on science, nature study, etc., that would help him in school. He says, “Everyone in the family can enjoy ‘Awake!’ because it’s written for young and old alike, and it costs only a dollar to get 24 copies delivered to your home each year. It costs so little, and gives you so much; you can’t afford to be without it.” Family discuss its value and then the father subscribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CONCLUSION (2 min.) Summary by chairman. Emphasize making subscription presentation at every door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE 1 (3 min.) Publisher working from house to house with “Awake!” subscription offer is confronted by householder who, although having read several copies of the magazine, objects to it because it speaks against other religions. He feels that there is some good in all religions, that all are merely traveling different roads to the same happy end, and that it would be much better for all religions to work together and try to exert a good influence on people who do not go to church. He claims that “Awake!” serves to divide rather than to unite people for a good cause. Publisher states that if householder wants to believe there is good in all religions, that is his right, but the Bible shows differently. “Where?” inquires householder. “Well, I don’t know exactly, but I know there are many scriptures that show God does not approve all religions, but only the true worship,” answers publisher. But the publisher is just not prepared to give a convincing witness, and nothing worth while is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (6 min.) </span><span class="font2">Second publisher, who is equipped with his copy of “Make Sure of All Things”, calls at a home and receives substantially the same argument from householder. He expresses himself as glad that householder has taken time to read several issues of “Awake!” and also says that he is pleased to have householder’s honest opinion of the magazine. Then he takes out his copy of “Make Sure of All Things” and turns to “Interfaith,” starting with page 187. He points out to householder that there are only two roads to travel, a right and a wrong, and inquires if householder has read these particular scriptures on the subject. He goes on to show (p. 186) that merely taking the name of God is not sufficient to get to the “same happy end.” In fact, the “many roads, one destiny” idea is a misleading principle that can keep one from true worship and is really only another way to describe the broad road that leads to destruction. (P. 186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus would not recognize religious leaders as “brothers,” nor did he overlook differences as “petty” and refrain from pointing out the shortcomings of professed servants of God. (P. 185) It is impossible to compromise by “straddling the fence,” because this would not please God. (P. 184) That is why “Awake!” must honestly state the truth regarding other religions, as well as adhere to true worship. But note that the magazine always compares religious teachings or pronouncements with the Bible, to show people the inconsistency and let them judge for themselves. A full discussion of facts never hurts those following the truth. Thus householder’s objections are answered and publisher goes on to make presentation of “Awake!” subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Conductor emphasizes need to be familiar with contents of “Make Sure of All Things” and have it with you in field so that it can help in overcoming obstacles and in giving a successful witness where you might otherwise not do so. It is valuable in many kinds of situations, but you have to know what is in it to use it to best advantage.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Pioneers Increasing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Since the world assembly more and more pioneers are being added to the list every day. Have you written for your pioneer application yet? Have you reviewed your position to see whether you can arrange to devote 100 hours a month to field activity? If so, then you should be on the pioneer list. Why not plan to start November 1 by requesting a pioneer application now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a pioneer moves from one country to another and intends to be gone for a period of six months or less, he should send his reports back to the Society’s branch office in his home country. If he is going to be gone for more than six months, he should immediately request the Society to transfer his pioneer records to the branch office in the country to which he is going. Additionally, he will write a letter to the Society in that country upon arrival, advising of his plans; and then he will send his monthly reports to that office. Missionaries, of course, always proceed as directed by the president’s office.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Convention Photographs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In response to many requests, the Society has made photographs of the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses. A set of six, size 8&quot; x 10&quot;, showing fourteen different scenes of the convention, may be obtained on a contribution of $1. There is also available an 8&quot; x 24&quot; photograph giving a panoramic view of the stadium during the public lecture on Sunday. This one is especially suitable for framing and should be hung in every Kingdom Hall. It may be had for $2. Orders for these photographs may be placed immediately, accompanied by remittance. All brothers wanting these photographs should please order through the congregation servant now.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Magazine Bound Volumes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Congregations and individual brothers who wish to have bound copies of the 1954 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> should place their orders now to ensure delivery. These must be ordered a year in advance so the Society will know how many additional copies of each issue to print throughout the year. Individuals should order through congregations where possible so that they may be shipped with congregation literature. This will save time and money. The cost is $2 a volume.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Loyalty and service are inseparable. A heart in harmony with God’s Word and organization, backed up by faithful, dependable performance of duty, shows loyalty. Aware of the need for further training in love and allegiance, Jehovah’s servants diligently strive to please him by adhering to the loyal principles of the Bible and the counsel set forth by his theocratic organization. This means continuous service in compliance with Jehovah’s will.—Josh. 23:8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mo.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It is the Word of God that accurately defines true loyalty. Righteous-hearted persons must learn of this! Therefore it is our responsibility to act upon the command to “feed my little sheep” by aiding and</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>A Note of Thanks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Many thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses were housed by New York city householders during the convention. Their hospitality was appreciated by us. Some went to considerable trouble preparing rooms, purchasing bed linen, etc., to care for us. With their kindness in mind, the Society believes it would be well for each group who stayed with a householder to write a short note of thanks immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers in New York city are now in the midst of calling on householders who opened their homes to conventioners, and your note of thanks may help. Fine results are being realized, with many Bible studies started. They appreciated having Jehovah’s witnesses and were blessed by their presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many publishers made their own arrangements to stay with New York householders. If any would like a New York publisher to call on the householder, the person’s name, address and other particulars may be sent to 117 Adams Street.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Approximately every six months each congregation is served by a circuit servant. To enable all publishers to know well in advance the exact dates, the circuit servant communicates with a congregation about two months before his visit. Upon receiving the advance notice, the congregation servant should announce the dates to the congregation, order handbills for the circuit servant’s public talk and in general start directing congregation matters so all will be in readiness for his visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> As the date of the visit draws near, a letter prepared by the Society, outlining basic activities for the entire week, is forwarded to the congregation by the circuit servant. In addition to reading this letter to the congregation upon receipt, time should be used on the service meeting a week or two before the visit to consider what is scheduled during his visit. Publishers should be assisted to understand the purpose of the circuit servant’s visit and be encouraged to enthusiastically support all activities scheduled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The congregation servant will check with each servant to see that his records are up to date and will be available for the circuit servant to go over Tuesday afternoon. Territory to be worked during the week will be selected, and, where the congregation book study arrangement is In effect, a tentative schedule for visiting them will be worked out for the circuit servant to consider upon arriving.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4 The congregation servant will plan and take oversight of the service meeting. Well in advance the program should be worked up and of the sowing work, Jehovah’s servants will water the seed that they plant by calling back faithfully on all placements made, providing further nourishment with effective back-calls. The Bible and book combination makes the obtainer an excellent prospect for a home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Loyalty is known only when it is demonstrated. All of Jehovah’s servants are determined to seek approval by their course of loyal service, and thus also influence many more to the side of true worship..</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark34"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">parts prepared by those assigned to serve on the service meeting. The school servant will give out assignments and assist any who might need help to prepare. Model meetings should result so all in attendance will be edified.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The visit of the circuit servant is a very special week for a congregation. Not only should all publishers support his visit, but persons of good will in the area should be given a special invitation to attend all meetings that week. Make arrangements to bring them to the meetings, if necessary, and let them know they are welcome to share in the various activities of the week. If personal contact cannot be made, a card or letter may be sent to persons of good will. Let them know that this is something special.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> All servants and mature publishers are encouraged to arrange to spend one or two days with the circuit servant in field work. This will enable him to train and offer counsel to those who will teach others in effective house-to-house ministry after he leaves. Usually publishers can arrange to get off from secular work a day or two for service with him. Additionally, the congregation servant will make definite appointments for the circuit servant to aid publishers in afternoon back-call and Bible study activity where possible, having in mind that he will be working with book study groups in large congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Circuit servants look forward to and prepare under the Society’s direction for being with a congregation. In turn, congregations and publishers who prepare for the circuit servant’s visit put themselves in position to reap the benefits intended for them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(To he continued]</span></p></li></ul>

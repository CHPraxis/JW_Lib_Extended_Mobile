<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 678 Tell the World How </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Feel</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah reigns ! Yes. the time so long looked for by faithful men of old, from Abel to John the Baptist, has come! The Kingdom is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">here; </span><span class="font3">for Jehovah, by his King Christ Jesus, has begun his reign. The prayer uttered by the followers of Christ Jesus for nineteen hundred years, “Thy kingdom come,” is in course of fulfillment. Not only has it come, but, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> so well puts it, “The Theocracy is here to stay !&quot; I&gt;'t all the willing and unwitting tools and dupes of Satan build their postwar structure ever so strong. Let them praise and exalt the work of their hands ever so highly. Let their false prophets paint it ever so white with whitewash and daub it with untenipered mortar. Before the Onward march of The Theocracy, their “abomination of desolation” is doomed to come to a most ignominious end. And as they bite the dust, they too will be made to know that the Kingdom is here, that Jehovah reigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A mighty chorus in heaven announced the beginning of that reign. (Rev. 11:17,18) Then Zion was told, “Thy God reigneth!” And now the time has come for the remaining members of Zion on earth and their good-will companions to herald forth this most important message far and wide. Host fitting therefore is our text for October: “Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: . . . Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.&quot;—I’s. 1)6: 1,10, A.S.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How shall we herald this gladsome message far and wide? First of all, by increasing the public meeting campaign to an intensity beyond anything attempted heretofore. Let all the servants in the companies bestir themselves to make sure that they do not overlook any opportunity to put on a public meeting series and that they perform their parts in connection with them with diligence and to the best of their ability. Let each and every company publisher get behind those arrangements and give them the support that they deserve, all they have. October is an ideal month for this, both for street advertising of the meetings and for holding them in open places, parks, vacant lots, pavilions, etc. Make the most of the equable weather. And wherever only the first four lectures were put on, what could be more appropriate than to now put on the remaining four, beginning with the lecture “ ‘Thy Kingdom Come’ When?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October a Banner Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are ever so many reasons why October should be a banner month. Not only is the weather favorable, but many who have relaxed on vacations are now again in the harness and have renewed energy to bear their part of the burden. The conflict between the two ‘kings’ of Satan's organization has subsided. No more feverish overtime work to that end, thus giving many an opportunity to listen, to read, to come to the lectures, and to have studies in their homes; and, for that matter, also giving many of the servants of Jehovah, who permitted themselves to be overreached by antitypical Egypt in this regard, the opportunity to reorient themselves and give the Kingdom proclamation tlie place in their lives that it deserves. Likewise, time spent in waiting in line and shopping around for the necessities of life is now made available for Kingdom service. And with the end of gasoline rationing, the problem of transportation has been greatly eased, thus not only saving time but also permitting the calling for new interest, both to take them to the public and other meetings and to have them join with us in the Kingdom announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And with gasoline available and good weather at hand, what an opportunity for all companies holding rural territory to give those living therein the opportunity to hear tlie message! And tlie offer for this month is especially attractive: two bound books and two booklets on a contribution of fifty cents. Make up for the opportunities lost in the rurals by placing the latest books you have on hand at every farmhouse. And when witnessing in the rurals, adjust your car group to the type of territory you are working, and do not have four or five publishers waiting at each farmhouse while one witnesses, but, where the homes are near enougii to each other, drop off those who are required to cover the available houses till the car is empty and then go back and pick them up. Thus you will have a witness given simultaneously at a number of homes instead of only one. The same applies to group back-call work. As soon as contact is made, let the rest proceed to the next call, and then later pick them up. Thus shall we be making the best use of our time and means and energy and help further to make October a banner month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special &quot;Consolation” Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nor is that all. A distinct privilege of service is being accorded to all servants of Jehovah in tlie distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> No. 678, containing the article “Jehovah's witnesses Triumph over Concentration Camps”. While many of the Lord’s people in this country were spared physical suffering at the hands of the enemy, yet all suffered by being the “companions of them that were so used”. And during the many years that our brethren have thus suffered at the hands of the demonized agents of Satan, we have not been ashamed of their bonds, but have gloried in their integrity-keeping course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, at their release, what greater testimony could we give to the world as to the sustaining power of Jehovah's active force, and as to our being “one” with them, than by a wide distribution of the true record of the triumph of our brethren in Germany? The larger companies (to which the Society has already written) are being given a special privilege in this connection in that they are to see to it that all federal and state officials in their territory are supplied with a copy. In large cities the company and unit servants should come together and plan the campaign. Beginning immediately, all companies, large or small, throughout the United States will have the privilege of making distribution of this magazine to local newspapers and magazine publishers, all local officials, the mayors, the councilmen, chiefs of police, judges, and others who hold prominent local offices. Other men in your community to whom you believe it would be well to distribute this issue should also be given copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Along with this personal distribution to prominent officials will go the distribution of this magazine to persons of good-will. Use your regular supply and order more. We want to see that all of our back-calls are served with a copy, especially those with whom we are conducting book studies. The magazine work for the distribution of this issue should be given extraordinary attention. Special evenings, as well as your usual time, should be set aside for street work and house-to-house distribution of this magazine. Let the good-will have a share in this work by seeing to it that they receive not only a copy for themselves but also additional copies for their neighbors, friends, and relatives, as well as for any regular service work they may do. All of the brethren likewise should see to it that their acquaintances, relatives, and business associates are supplied with a copy. Pioneers in isolated territory should arrange to carry on in the same manner. We are ‘companions of those so used’, and we are not ashamed to manifest it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any company, whether it has a magazine account or not, and that orders ten or more copies of tliis issue at one time, will be supplied them at the rate of 2Jc a copy. If a full remittance accompanies each order It will expedite and speed up the shipment. All companies should do their part and immediately order as many as they require, marking envelope “Attention </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">Desk”. Every company publisher in the country should try to put out at least ten copies of this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> and special and general pioneers in proportion. Order with this in mind. In the case of companies or pioneers in isolated territory who do not have a magazine account, a remittance must accompany the order, as there is no account to which to charge them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, Jehovah reigns! Tell ei’ery-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> about it! Do so by increased activity in the public meeting campaign, in the special distribution of</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Beneficial Use of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book in Service Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The abundant benefits of the use of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font3"> as a textbook in the Theocratic ministry course have been clearly apparent to all. Jehovah's servants, by its use, are increasingly being equipped as more able ministers and their efficiency in gospel-preaching is becoming more and more apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fullest use of this gracious provision, however, is realized when its benefits are extended beyond the course, to the service meetings, where every publisher in the company can receive instruction that will in time equip him to have a full share in every feature of Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Practical Benefits Gained</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From time to time, then, it is well to take various lessons from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid</span><span class="font3"> textbook as the basis for instructive and valuable demonstrations and other features of the service meeting. For instance, Lesson 48, “Theocratic Tactfulness,” can be used in the following manner as a valuable example of the use of tact in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To provide a setting, let a brother present before the company the meaning of tact, and outline the Scriptural illustrations given in the first four paragraphs of the lesson. Then, in order to illustrate the right and the wrong manner of deportment. have a publisher take the part of a tactless individual and abruptly tell another publisher, representing a householder, that he or she should no longer go to church, and that it is run by the Devil, etc. As shown In the book, this illustrates how many wrong impressions are conveyed and abiding prejudices built up by improper conduct. Then, by having another publisher approach the householder and use the tactful and proper method, demonstrate the way to create good-will and gain favorable results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Follow the lesson on through, letting others illustrate the right and the wrong approach to Catholics, Jews, and others, and the entire performance will result in much profit to the whole company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">His Active Force upon Kingdom Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Jehovah’s Way of Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has been pleased during recent years to reveal to his people more clearly than ever before the vital importance of his active force or holy spirit and that his purpose can be accomplished only through its enlightenment and strength. All publishers, regardless of position, must apply for and submit themselves to the active force of the Lord if they are going to do His work properly. The prophecy (Isa. 61:1-3) applied primarily to Jesus, and also applies to the members of his body, and the principle it outlines applies to every consecrated creature that participates in the Lord’s service. The opening statements of the prophecy direct our attention to the active force of Jehovah as the basic essential requisite of the service about to be accomplished, by saying: ‘The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because he has anointed me...’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is only after we as Kingdom publishers realize this great fundamental fact that we can properly submit ourselves to the purposes of the Lord and become real witnesses. James evidently had this point in mind when speaking to the Kingdom servants of his day. He said, “The body without the spirit is dead.” Also the prophet Zechariah, in the calendar text for the month of November, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts,” and Jesus, in his statement in John 6:63, “It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh prof-iteth nothing,” make it very clear that the active force of Jehovah is indispensable to the Kingdom publisher today and that without it It is impossible for him to do Jehovah’s service properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The experiences of our brethren in Germany and other totalitarian countries during the past ten years is the greatest possible demonstration of what the active force of Jehovah can do for his servants, preserving, quickening and strengthening for every ordeal, and energizing them to go forward in the service on every opportunity. It is this active force that reveals to us the Kingdom in all its surpassing power and glory, and enables us to enter into or come under its control and understand what type of service is to be rendered in order to be acceptable to Jehovah, the King of Eternity. His active force has also revealed to us that the Lord has come in power and great glory, that he has established the New World Government, and has brought forth his “faithful and wise servant” and given him rulership ‘over all his goods and his household’. The same active force reveals to us that that “faithful and wise servant” is the consecrated spirit-begotten servants of the Lord organized into unity and functioning as Jehovah's witnesses under the direction of the present “Commander to the peoples”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Active Force In November Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It enables us to see that the instrument used by that &quot;servant” in distributing things new and old and directing how they shall be used is the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. Looking to this agency for directions for our November service activity, we find the Lord ever true to his arrangement, directing his people to go forth and proclaim “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”, by means of the distribution of the Kingdom message contained in books and booklets (any two of each on a contribution of 50e), and particularly that before winter sets in we call upon the people in the small towns and rural communities who have been isolated for the past four</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">years because of war restrictions. Just as the active power of Jehovah led Jesus into the wilderness, so it impels the Lord's people today to feed these hungry ones, make back-calls, conduct studies, and otherwise assist and comfort them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We should never lose sight of the fact that we received the holy spirit of the Lord upon conditions, which were based upon our consecration previously made to do the Lord’s will. That will is now clear. For the publisher to withhold or refrain from preaching this gospel of the Kingdom would amount to obtaining the active force of Jehovah under false pretense and receiving the grace of God in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, every publisher impelled by the active force to give testimony of Jehovah will follow through making back-calls and arranging for book studies with the people who manifest interest, and thus carry out his active commission. In addition to the house-to-house work, public meetings can be arranged for and magazine work done in these small towns and rural communities. Store-to-store work on Saturday afternoon will reach large numbers of farmers who can be invited to the public talk, which may be put on either on Saturday evening or on Sunday. The willing servant quickened by the active force of Jehovah will joyfully embrace all of these opportunities to do the will of Jehovah and aid the people of goodwill to appreciate their need of the Kingdom, assist them in coming to the meetings, and help them to understand their Kingdom privileges at and after the meetings, by calling back upon them and assisting them with their studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is much of this type of service to be done before the severe winter months set in. The servants are to plan and take the lead in this and all branches of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies that have no rural territories, and publishers who are unable to go into the rurals and small towns, will work in their regular urban territory and busy themselves in all branches of the service. Each consecrated servant of the Lord should ever keep in mind the fact of Isaiah 61:1: “The spirit of the Lord Goo is upon me.” The Lord’s holy spirit is not limited to the anointed, but is also upon the Jona-dabs, who are within the organization of the Lord. Therefore, they, too, should be ever conscious of their privileges and obligations in this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With the forms for reports for the year 1946, the Society forwarded to all companies and pioneers a letter outlining in detail the procedure of proper reporting. All companies, and particularly the company servants, should study this letter carefully, so that all may co-operate in unity with proper understanding of what is required of them.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“The Stranger Must Be Fed”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">World leaders are noticeably perturbed, in this day, by the plight of millions of unfortunates starving for want of physical food. But of much more serious concern is the fact that there are living today multitudes on the verge of perishing for want of spiritual food, found in God’s Word. Among these are countless numbers of “strangers” of good-will, whose state of spiritual malnutrition causes them to cry out with earnest desire for something better than the husks that they have been fed via religion's starvation diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What consecrated servant of Jehovah lives who would refuse to lift a finger to help such, or decline to share his “food” with another? The “stranger” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font3"> be fed; for Jehovah has decreed it. But how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witnessing from house to house is the first step; but only the first. Placing abundant literature does not constitute ‘feeding the stranger’, within the full meaning of the term. Of prime importance is calling back, to ascertain what progress, if any, is being made, and to show the ‘stranger’ how to study the literature and to increase the “stranger's” desire to learn. Some say, “But I have called back, and the person simply does not take hold.” Maybe so; but can we expect outstanding results on the first call or two? Few come into the truth overnight; rather, it requires patient feeding, over a period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What are some of the reasons why back-calls may prove unsuccessful? In answer, consider a back-call of this nature that you made recently and ask yourself these questions concerning it: “Before approaching the person, did I fully prepare, having in mind something definite to present (Scripturally), so as not to ‘beat the air’ ? Was I untactful in any way? Did I stay too long? Did I make the call because of my ardent desire to aid the ‘stranger’, putting full confidence in the Lord to bless my efforts, and lead me to His sheep, or simply to be making a back-call?” Thus you analyze your presentation and, knowing wherein you may have fallen short, are in position to improve on future visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With a successful back-call established, the feeding process has begun. Next conies development into a book study. How? One method is the use of the Study Questions booklet, to get the book study started. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Show</span><span class="font3"> the stranger the value of the book and the booklet. Show him how to study, perhaps by selecting beforehand a pertinent question or two, asking the question, and suggesting that he get his book and Bible, as you want to point out how he can use the question booklet in connection therewith. Help the interested one find the scripture cited, ask him to read it and the paragraph, then summarize by pointing out the valuable information gained, in just a few minutes of such study. Tactfully arrange to call back, and begin your study. Follow </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid</span><span class="font3"> suggestions, and the results will surely be forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the back-call book study the “stranger&quot; should be encouraged to attend the company book study, a live, instructive meeting well supported by the publishers. Simultaneously he should be invited to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> study and service meeting, where, in assembly regularly with the Lord’s people, the “stranger” will soon see his privilege of actively responding to the invitation at Revelation 22: 17 : “Let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “stranger” must be fed. Upon us rests this serious responsibility, which cannot be shirked. If we make the effort to this end, Jehovah will add the increase.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Arrange Interesting Service Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lively, enthusiastic service meetings are a vital necessity to a healthy, active company. Regardless, though, of how good a service meeting might be, the effect is lost to some unless all publishers are there to benefit by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To aid the companies arrange for better and more interesting service meetings, we are submitting a suggested outline for each service meeting in October. Five minutes before the meeting starts a song may be sung. First open the meeting with prayer, then briefly welcome the strangers, outline the program for the evening, and discuss the daily text. We shall assume this meeting is held on Thursday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October 4, 1945</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5 minutes: Prayer; welcome, program, daily text, by company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">25 minutes : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> article “Jehovah Reigns”. (Give short introduction, ask questions and have audience answer, and have each paragraph read by a good reader.)</span></p>

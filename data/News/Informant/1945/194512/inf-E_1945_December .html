<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Walk Daily in the Courts of Your Father</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The most precious treasure that can be enjoyed now by any creature on this earth, and which accumulates dividends for future benefit, is engaging in the Creator’s service. Very few people value such treasure, nor do they seek after it. Contrariwise, millions of people struggle frantically for material gains and profits which can give, at the most, only temporary comfort. They do not realize that their existence depends upon service to their Creator. Many of these, however, are willing to learn about the real treasures offered freely by Jehovah God to all who wish to accept his “free gift of life”. This blessed privilege of teaching others concerning these treasures Jehovah has bestowed upon human creatures. How much better could our work be done by the angels I But no, His name is magnified and vindicated amid human weaknesses. “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”-—2 Cor. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This treasure is not merely the knowledge that we have obtained from careful and diligent study of the Lord's Word. It is the ministry of that knowledge unto others. Moth, rust and thieves cannot damage or destroy such treasure as long as we faithfully perform the service to which we have been commissioned. The only treasure that will survive the fiery battle of Armageddon and continue unsinged and unconsumed into the New World is “this treasure of service”. His power will never fail us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Protect Your Treasure In December</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Treasure of Service” Testimony Period in December will offer a splendid opportunity to all seekers of the true treasure of life to gain this treasure in the active proclamation of the Kingdom message in the field service. The offer during December will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples”,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of 25c. Undoubtedly your rural territory has been covered during the summer and fall months with this offer, so now arrangements should be made to cover your urban territory. Concentrate on your city and town territory this month and make plans to see that every home is visited with the Kingdom message. By working city territory you will meet more people and be able to make more back-calls and conduct more studies, with less traveling, than when working the rurals. Thus the Kingdom witness will reach more people during the next month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the effective means of aiding the people to come in line for their share of heavenly treasures is through the public meetings. Therefore, as ambassadors of the Lord and ministers of his ‘riches’ let us keep this channel of truth open to them by holding public meetings reg</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">ularly, and inviting everyone to attend. Do not become disheartened if few attend the meeting. If only one person of good-will attends, the meeting is well worth the time and effort spent in putting it on. Our responsibility is to ‘let the light shine’ by making provision for others to receive of these heavenly treasures. If the people who are invited do not wish to attend, then the responsibility rests upon them. Nevertheless, we must continue to keep the way open to receive them by putting on and widely advertising the public meetings and making them feel welcome when they do attend. We must make back-calls upon them, and conduct studies with them, and invite them to participate with us in our other meetings and in the service of the Lord as soon as they are able to join with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Value Your Treasure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Do you appreciate the fact that your privilege of regularly engaging in the service of your Creator is of far greater value to you than all the gold and silver in the whole world? The Kingdom publisher should tenaciously cling to his treasure of serving his Creator far more than to anything else that could be imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The value of our “treasure of service” does not depart from us even though we may lose our lives. It will still have merit and worth and enable us to be resurrected again to life. Truly there is no treasure that can be compared to it. How foolish it is for one who is blessed with such heavenly treasures and opportunities of service to ignore their value and belittle their excellence by treating them with indifference and nonchalance ! December is a month for action. Even if the weather is unfavorable there is no good reason why every publisher for the Kingdom cannot share during this month in the spreading of the treasuresome news of the Kingdom's establishment and operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people of the world do not have such treasures, nor do they appreciate their value. Whatever a person values most, there will his attentions and energies be directed. As stated, “Where your treasure is,</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">there will your heart be also.” The Christian will not be found in places of public entertainment, enjoying the pleasures of this life and the things offered by this old world, but will be found in the ‘house of his Father’ actively expending his efforts to further the Kingdom interests. Just as Jesus stated to his mother when he was but twelve years old. when they found him in the temple, “Did you not know that I must be in the courts of my Father?” so, likewise, the Christian today will be found only in the ‘courts of his Father’, which is serving the Creator in His organization, taking the message to the people of good-will in their homes. Keep active in the courts of your Father during December. Hold high the priceless value of your “treasure of service” to your Creator.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Postal Notes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren are now making remittances to the Society by means of the new United States postal notes. This is to remind all who use these postal notes that they must make certain at the time the notes are purchased that the post office has stamped thereon the name of the city and the date. Also, if these have a value of any amount other than even dollars, they must have stamps affixed for the value of the cents. If either the postal note stamps or the rubber stamp of the issuing office is lacking, the postal note is of no value to us. Also, they are good for j only two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">No Shortage of Cartons </span><span class="font3">! The shortage of new shipping cartons no longer exists. Companies and pioneers need no longer ship used cartons to the Society. Your cooperation in sending in cartons during the emergency is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Organization Instructions” and the “Informant</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Earnestly Study and Apply These Valuable Instructions for Continual Improvement as Theocratic Servants</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The definite objective of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> is the enlightenment of Jehovah’s servants for unified, efficient, and zealous activity in Kingdom service. All who are consecrated to serve the Lord might see the necessity of gospel preaching and undertake individual activity in that direction, but without a centralized source of instruction and direction the effort would lack co-ordination and would fail to bring about the oneness of action required of Jehovah’s unified servant body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This shows the need of every publisher’s attending regularly the service meetings to receive instruction as to the very best methods of carrying forward the Kingdom service activity. By regular, diligent study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font3"> not only at the service meeting, but privately as well, every publisher will be instructed on all vital matters of field activity and understand such points as: What is the best method of approaching the people in their homes and teaching</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Immersion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren are inquiring regarding immersion, whether it is proper for the local company organization to make preparation for such a service. It is proper and right, in companies and units where brethren want to be immersed, for the company servant or unit servant to take the necessary steps and see that arrangements are made for immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where a number of small companies in one vicinity desire to arrange for immersion, it is quite proper for the brethren in all these companies to come together for such a service. In the larger cities it isprop-er for the company servant to make arrangements to have one immersion for all the units.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Yearbook and Calendar</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The 1946 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font3"> with its report of activity in 1945, is faith-inspiring and enlightening. The work of Jehovah accomplished by and through his organization during the year is something that deserves the prayerful and grateful consideration of each consecrated servant of the Lord and every person of good-will. No one can afford to miss it. Each one in the company and every back-call should be given an opportunity to obtain this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also, the 1946 Calendar, with its theme, “Be glad, ye nations, with his people,” is available. This calendar is prepared to keep before the mind of those who are interested in the Kingdom the Theocratic activities of the Lord’s people during the year, and the Scriptural basis for such service work. There should be at least one in every home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The orders are coming in fast, and we hope to have all orders filled by early December. Shipment from here has already begun. Those who have not yet ordered their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font3"> or Calendars should order immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">them God’s Word? What is the most effective way to engage in street activity? How are public lectures arranged for and properly handled? How may a company organization operate smoothly and effectively in advancing the Kingdom interests? Thus the need of careful and earnest study of these instructions which go into every feature of Kingdom service becomes very apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> booklet should now be studied weekly in the service meeting (about 15 minutes of each service meeting) until completed, all taking an active part in the study and carefully reading the scriptures cited in support of the points outlined. In considering the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> let the one assigned to this part of the meeting carefully prepare in advance material that will emphasize the points under discussion, and let all the others eagerly share in it, so that, being fully enlightened, zealous application of the instructions may be made to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>January Begins Eighth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscription</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">“I have set the Loud always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.” (Fs. 16:8) How well those words describe the stand taken by our Commander when on earth ! Never once did he waver, never once did he follow the lines of least resistance, never once did he yield to religion, to creature worship. His was the greatest of all examples of immovability for right worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But he lived more than nineteen hundred years ago. What about today? Is there a bold and faithful champion of the true worship at the present time? Yes, the “faithful and wise servant”. Jehovah’s visible Theocratic organization, since the cleansing of the temple, has been and is giving an outstanding example of immovability for right worship. It has fostered and spread that right worship to the four corners of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How has it done this? Primarily, by its official channel of communication, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> By means of this instrument thousands upon thousands have been helped to take their stand for right worship and to remain immovable therein. In totalitarian countries men risked their lives to keep in touch with that channel of communication, and through the Theocratic underground and with the help of Jehovah they succeeded even though in prisons and in concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Banned for years from one of the so-called “democratic” lands “down under”, yet the servants of Jehovah there were able to report regarding </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> “Never once did we have to go without its regular visits.” True, in those lands under or influenced by totalitarianism it did not always appear in the same garb, nor under the same title; how could it, often being copied by hand, mimeographed by the underground, and printed in concentration camps? But the message was there, and its inspiring revelation of truths and its bold and unequivocal stand for right worship gave courage and strength to those so sorely tried while upholding right worship. Its Immovability galvanized their spirits to be likewise immovable for right worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How fitting, then, that the month of January with its Theocratic theme “Immovability for Right Worship” should begin the eighth annual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription campaign ! For four months, from January through April, every Kingdom publisher will do his utmost to demonstrate his own immovability for right worship by obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> There is a great multitude of persons who are ‘seeking after God, if haply they might find him’, and who would gladly embrace the right worship if they only knew about it. They need </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to reveal it to them. Do we appreciate the help that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> gives in such articles as “Immovable for the Right Worship”, “Defense Through Knowledge,” “Remembering the New &quot;World's Creator,” to mention just a few? Such information is absolutely indispensable to all who desire to do that which is right. And then the doctrinal points it clears up, such as that of baptism, the sabbath, the Ten Commandments, etc. What Scriptural and reasonable foundation for faith! what help for all who sincerely desire to know the truth and be pleasing to God! Our brethren who felt the fury of the totalitarian monstrosity fully appreciated its in-dispensabllity, and to the extent that we likewise appreciate its value, to that extent we will be diligent to get its message into the hands of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Quotas</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year there will be a separate quota for each country, the quota for the United States being 150,000 subscriptions. The individual quota for company publishers will be one subscription per month, while full-time publishers will strive for a minimum of seven subscriptions each month. These quotas should not be hard to attain in view of the many opportunities for obtaining subscriptions. Talk subscriptions at every door in the house-to-house work, at back-calls and book studies, in the street magazine work (always carrying subscription blanks and a bound book and booklet with you), with business acquaintances and fleshly relatives, etc. With the subscription, of course, go the bound book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Commander to the Peoples&quot;, </span><span class="font3">all on a contribution of one dollar. Other books and booklets may be used if the one subscribing has already obtained these latest publications. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> may be offered if </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has already been subscribed for or its presentation fails to strike a responsive chord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Importance of Planning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To get this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign off with a bang, start making arrangements at once. Increase your distributors’ copies so that there will be enough sample copies on hand for all company publishers and pioneers. In doing so, be sure to use the special order blank provided for this purpose. Do not use the regular literature order blank. All subscriptions should be carefully checked by the accounts servant (those living in the larger cities being particularly careful to check the zone numbers) before sending them into the Society’s office. With each new English subscription 75c is to be sent, the balance being kept by the company publisher obtaining the subscription to defray the cost of the bound book and booklet given free with the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Territory also needs to be lined up, taking particular care to reach such as were neglected during previous campaigns, those living in the rurals and in outlying sections of our territory now being accessible due to the end of gasoline rationing. See to it that by the time the campaign is over the residents of every home in your assigned territory have had at least one opportunity to avail themselves of the valuable information contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While we are to feature </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in the English language, we must not overlook the fact that it is also published in a number of other languages, particularly the Spanish edition, which comes in the Identical form as the English and as frequently. Diligent activity with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> offer among the Spanish-speaking people both in this country and in the lands to the south of us should give added impetus to the already rapidly expanding witness work among them. In addition to Spanish, other languages for which subscriptions may be taken are French. German, Greek, Italian, Bolish, Russian, Slovak, and Ukrainian. With tlie exception of the French and German editions, which are $1.50 a year, all these are the same as for the English, which subscription rates apply to the United States only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Publicly and at Your Houses”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font3"> subscription campaign, however, is not the only organized effort to be pushed during January. With this month the public meeting campaign enters its second year. The recent developments, such | as the strained relations between tlie Allies, the outbreak of war and rev-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Full Support and Co-operation Bring Results </span><span class="font3">“And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.” (Acts 15:36) Unquestionably, the servant to the brethren visit, 1900 years ago, was an occasion of delight and gladness. Not only did all responding enjoy the blessedness of Christian companionship with one another and their brother from ‘headquarters’, but they were thoroughly instructed in applying organization instructions, as Issued by the governing body at Jerusalem. These visits must have had an exhilarating, unifying, strengthening effect upon all assembled, for the scripture records that ‘the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today the visit of the servant to the brethren is also of importance, for it is now that the “new song” must be sung, harmoniously, by all devoted servants. How can companies and publishers derive the most benefit from such visit? Presented herewith are a few suggestions to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Immediately after being notified of the visit, the company should begin preparing for it. The Company Information forms, with all entries thereon made in ink or with typewriter, should be carefully filled out by the committee, as soon as all figures for the month just preceding the visit are complete. Do not wait until the last minute to do this, for inaccuracy may result. To the servants’ meeting all should come prepared to take notes, so as not to ‘let slip’ any pertinent counsel offered. The servants’ meeting, incidentally, is to be attended only by servants and study conductors. The servant to the brethren may note points for improvement on the Company Information form; this will necessitate the company servant’s checking this form at least once a month, and keeping the company posted as to progress made in</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">olution in various parts of the earth, the general unrest at home as indicated by strikes, etc., all give new force to the subjects listed, and, by the speakers’ keeping their talks up to the minute, these will be ever new and timely. All will therefore continue to diligently support these public meetings, covering the territory again and again, even as the Israelites kept on marching around the ancient city of Jericho.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Persist also in the home educational feature of the work. During the cold winter evenings people like to stay at home and enjoy its comforts and the coziness of the fireside. If we will but brave the cold (taking proper precautions) we shall find ourselves richly rewarded, for we shall most likely find them at home and glad to spend an evening with us in discussing the truth. And remember, every placement of literature, be it only a booklet, is reason for calling back. At back-calls and book studies we accomplish the most as regards establishing the right worship, bring the most good to those loving righteousness, and receive the greatest blessing ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Obtaining </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions in the house-to-house activity, in the street work, etc., giving full support to the public meeting campaign, making back-calls and conducting book studies, and doing all this with diligence and joy, and in spite of what the weather may be, that is the way to demonstrate “immovability for right worship” during । January.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">carrying out recommendations. In event changes in records or files are suggested, in order to bring them in line with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions, </span><span class="font3">accept such unmurmuringly. Beginning January 1, 11)46. all letters sent to the servant to the brethren will be addressed in care of the company servant, who will guard against misplacing any mail, and hand it to the servant to the brethren as soon as possible after he receives it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It would be well for every publisher to try to set aside, temporarily, other pursuits, in order to share in full measure the blessings in store. Make an effort to personally engage in some feature of field activity with the servant to the brethren. Discuss service matters with him ; for he will delight to assist you in any way possible. He is with the company solely to sebve his brethren. Additionally, Invite all persons of good-will to meet with the company during this assembly, to hear the timely, instructive talks given, to meet the servant to the brethren, and to become acquainted with other publishers, i Make arrangements to bring newly । interested ones; for it has been noted that many good-will persons have gotten their first taste of joyful field service as a result of diligent publisher-action in getting them to associate during the visit. Pioneers, general and special, will also profit measurably by this visit, in attending all meetings, absorbing the vital counsel imparted, and using such, in joint service with company publishers, to thereafter magnify Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Keep in mind that the servant to the brethren is simply another one of Jehovah’s witnesses, with increased privileges delegated to him. In his own strength and ability he can accomplish nothing in the company. But the spirit of the Ixird acting through him can, does, and will accomplish much in organizing the brethren for more efficient service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Full benefit of the servant to the brethren visit may be assured through application of one meaningful word, co-operation, complete, unselfish, wholehearted co-operation by every member of the company, the company servant, assistant servants, all company publishers, pioneers and special pioneers, working as one, attending all meetings, and accompanying the servant to the brethren in the field. Thus doing, the servant to the brethren visit will prove to be an occasion of gladness and thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Bank Accounts</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On June 20, 1944, the Society sent a letter to the companies of average size or larger asking for information concerning the companies’ bank accounts, and providing a form for the company servants and accounts servants to fill out and return to the Secretary’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since then, there have been some changes in check signers, bank used, and other changes affecting this information, and also additional companies have opened up bank accounts. Therefore, any company that has had a change in the Information previously given regarding the bank account and has not filled out a new form for the Secretary’s Office, and all companies that have since opened up bank accounts and have not supplied this information, should now do so. In each case the company servant should write to the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Inc., Secretary's Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y., stating that there has been a change in the company bank account, or that a bank account has been opened, and request the bank account cards to till out and return.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Time Now for</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Co-ordinated Activity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The expression “United Announcers&quot; brings to the Lord's people the thrilling recollection of the wonderful assembly of that name held during the year 1944. This assembly was undoubtedly the greatest exhibition of unity and co-ordinated activity of the Lord's people up to that time. And as they recall that, they cannot help but recall the thrilling announcements “The Kingdom of God is Nigh”, and “The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand”, which visualized the grand disci-pling work done by Jesus, Jehovah’s greatest witness of all time, and who left us the proper example for discipling all nations. All of these inspiring recollections constitute the background for the “United Kingdom Announcers” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same uniting spirit and coordinated efforts in evidence at Buffalo and the other assembly points throughout the earth will undoubtedly be in evidence throughout the month of April as the Lord's people everywhere participate in this testimony period, and which will, without a question, make April a month worthy of the title &quot;United Kingdom Announcers” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The complete unification of the public meeting campaign, tlie goal of a new peak of publishers in all branches of the Kingdom service, and the celebration of the Memorial, just past, are the outstanding events that go to make April the month of months for the year 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nourishment and Protection Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ll'a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tch towcr</span><span class="font4"> Campaign has hit a new high. Six weeks before tlie campaign ends, we have 93,009 new subscriptions already put through, and there are other thousands going through and in the mail. And, with over one-third of the campaign still to go, there is very little doubt that we shall have well over 150.000 new subscribers drinking in the life-giving Kingdom message every fifteen days as a result of these subscriptions placed. However, that allows only for one person reading each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> as the ease may be, whereas in many cases a number </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font4">persons will undoubtedly read these publications, thus swelling the total number of people being witnessed to as a result of this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the sowing of the seed is not all that is required here. Further unity and co-ordination are necessary in order to accomplish the ultimate purpose. Tlie seed must be nourished and protected from the elements and other destructive agencies. It must be watered and the people helped and protected from the enemies of the Lord and His people. Therefore, let no one leave this splendid job only partly finished. Let each one assume the obligation before the Lord to finish the job by thoroughly nourishing and protecting this interest by making regular back-calls upon the people, inquiring how they are getting along in the study of the magazine. Help them to see and appreciate the marvelous prophecies now being fulfilled and revealed through these magazines. Conduct studies with them, and invite and assist them to attend the public meetings and the other company studies. This is all a part of the co-ordinated efforts that go to make the “United Kingdom Announcers” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Faith in the Lord’s Power Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">United with this is the public meeting campaign, which has advanced with such phenomenal success everywhere that the brethren have gone forward in faith and zeal and put on the series as outlined. The evident blessing of the Lord upon the progress of the campaign leaves no doubt about its being the Lord's will to have such a campaign now and that he is directing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some brethren lacked faith to start out right away on the series. They were conscious of their own limitations and permitted these frailties to assume larger proportions in their mind than the power of the Lord's holy spirit. As a result they did not get started immediately, and to that extent missed a great blessing, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ns well</span><span class="font4"> as, for a period, withholding from the &quot;stranger” the message of the Kingdom, which the Lord now has indicated shall be brought to all people of good-will by means of the public meeting campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any brother who has conscientiously applied himself to the Theocratic Ministry Course and can read, write and speak the English language understandingly should be able to prepare and deliver one or more of these talks with the aid of the outline and the help of the holyspirit of the Lord which quickens even his mortal body .-Rom. 8:11.12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The many demonstrations which ' we have had during this campaign | of what the Lord has done with brethren who have really applied themselves with faith and zeal are beyond recounting. This is true of young brothers and old brothers, and those brethren in between. All that is required is faith in the Lord to do his work through you, wholehearted submission to the spirit of the Lord, and diligent application to the task before you. This means hard work. However, it is the greatest possible privilege: and blessing that any creature could have now, to stand forth as the mouthpiece of the Lord God. It is a; blessing worth striving for even if you have to wrestle all night for it as did Jacob of old, by studying, preparing and practicing these talks. Let each one who has been doubtful now go forward in faith, never doubting. You have the Lord's assurance that you can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Combine Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where two or even three small companies exist close to one another they may unite in arranging for the advertising and putting on the public meeting campaign by supplying speakers for one another, and where the company is very small the publishers of both companies may unite and put on the series in one company territory and then in the other, alternating after each complete series until a number of series are put on in each company territory. In such cases, however, the present interest in each company territory should not be neglected. Keep up your back-calls and studies and local witnessing as much as possible between times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Memorial this year was on March 28. Every consecrated servant of the Lord and each person of good-will attended that service and heard the mighty works of our God recounted, and visualized his own place in His great arrangements. These are now anxious to go forward joyfully to meet the requirements necessary for the Lord's approval. All should continue to have some part in the Lord’s Kingdom service and continually experience that peace and joy that comes from a consciousness of a Kingdom service faithfully rendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An all-time peak of publishers should be registered during the month of April and continue to manifest itself throughout the coming months. United co-ordination of Kingdom announcers is now a privilege and obligation resting upon all consecrated servants of the Most High God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Pioneer Letter for April</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Again the call goes out from Jehovah’s organization for more pioneer servants. Another letter dealing with the present-day opportunities of becoming full-time proclaim-ers of the Kingdom evangel has been sent to all companies with the April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> It sots forth the example of Christ Jesus and the early apostles in forsaking all. so that they could be completely filled with God's holy spirit and energized thereby to spend all their time and substance in proclamation of the kingdom of heaven. Furthermore, it shows the way is now open for all who can to leave all and serve as full-time ministers of the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As this letter is considered and discussed in the company meetings, do not let the present unsettled and distressing conditions in the earth deter you from taking up full-time service; do not let the hatred of God’s enemies hold you hack, either. Take courage from the knowledge that Jehovah will not permit his</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Public Meeting Campaign</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As the public meeting campaign increases and expands, it is good to consider various points which, put in practice, will bring about improvement in this vast evangelistic effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Effective participation in this great evangel requires much training and preparation, and as this activity is not limited to those who actually do the public speaking, everyone finds it necessary to become fully equipped as an able minister so that each part may be performed faithfully. In this connection, all who diligently study will become apt to teach and instruct others, by means of the company studies and Theocratic Ministry Course. These studies are the provision of the Lord to prepare his servants to bear the gospel of the Kingdom, and many a brother who now does not feel able to give a public lecture can train himself by the Lord’s help and faithful application of the truths learned in these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speaking ability comes as a result of much study, preparation and practice; and if some are at first unable to speak fluently, let them constantly seek to improve their ability. In time the effort will bear fruitage, and they will be able to present a talk with clearness, coherence and conviction. The same principles apply to all in the company. In order to be able ministers all must study and make progress in ability to teach others. Therefore, when the speakers do their part well and all the company publishers ably support the effort, the people of good-will who attend the public lectures will be enlightened and fed, and the Lord's blessing manifested on the combined activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-operation of Speaker and Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Complete co-ordination between the speaker and publishers assigned to support and attend the meeting is needed for its success. The speaker, presentable in apjfearance, will be introduced by the chairman, also clean and neatly attired. A few introductory remarks will suffice to present the speaker, who will then do his best to develop a clear and convincing argument in support of his topic. At the close of the meeting the chairman will advise the audience of future company meetings and of the free booklet being offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 3) </span><span class="font4">true worship to disappear from the earth, but. on the contrary, will extend it to the ends of the earth, thus opening up the way for thousands of his zealous servants to become pioneers. Carefully weigh the facts presented in the letter, and, if possible, put aside all restraining influences so that God’s holy spirit may energize you to faithful fulltime pioneer activity. (This letter will be read at the first </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">study and first service meeting after being received, and carefully studied at the second service meeting after receipt.)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Thorough Witness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>To the Ends of the Earth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Expansion of the Public Meeting Campaign </span><span class="font4">“And ye shall be my witnesses . . . unto the uttermost part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8, A.S.F.) What striking fulfillment these words- are having in this year of 1945! Not only do we see the witnesses of Jehovah regaining more and more ground, as, due to the blessing of the Lord upon their relentless efforts, bans are being lifted in one country after another (England being the latest to do so), and the work blossoming forth with renewed vigor as the forces of totalitarianism are being driven from one land after another, but we also see special publishers (with Gilead training) ever widening their sphere of activity as they carry the witness to more and more Centra] and South American countries, and to the isles of the sea. Yes, there Is a great work being done by the Lord and it is definitely heading for the ends of the earth. However, this increasing of the work is not to be considered merely as applying to the spread of the work in foreign lands. There is much work ahead for each one of us; for &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot; indicates not only a widespread witness, but also a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thorough</span><span class="font4"> one. And that is where our activity for the month of May conies in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without a doubt, by the time May rolls around all witnesses will agree that the first four months of this year were the busiest and best yet. The greatest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign to date will by then be a matter of history, all indications at the present time pointing to its exceeding anything done in the past, and the public meeting campaign will be in full swing, ever increasing as the weather becomes more favorable, and the announcers, one and all, become more proficient in this new work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, while doing so we have more or less limited our efforts to witness publicly and from house to house to the cities and the home towns. Now the time has come to make it a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thorough</span><span class="font4"> witness, by each company carrying it to the ‘uttermost parts’ of its own territory. Now is the time to arrange for the intensified witness by means of the public meeting campaign in other sections of the territory and in the small outlying towns, and to invite the people in the rurals and suburbs to hear these lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor need we limit our public meeting series to Sundays. In some country sections it may be found advantageous to have these meetings on a Saturday or other “shopping&quot; night, when the town is full of farmers and others who are doing their trading. Also, such companies as are unable to put on a series, due to lack of qualified brothers, should take advantage of the visit of the servant to the brethren to put on at least one public meeting during his stay regardless of the time of the week that may be. Spend all day advertising the meeting, chiefly on the streets, but also by the personal invitation method from house to house. Elicit the cooperation of rural schoolteachers to obtain permission to give announcements to the children to take home, and use any and all other means available to carry the advertising to the widely scattered rural community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the reports at hand it is very gratifying to note that the public meeting campaign has been a decisive factor in increasing both the number of publishers and the average hours spent by them in Kingdom service. However, in spite of these increases, in some companies there has actually been a decrease as regards the back-call and book-study features of the work. This should not be. In fact, just the opposite should be the case. All those responding to the public-meeting advertising should be called on, as well as keeping up our regular back-calls and book studies. If this were done there would be an increase in these features of the work also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where book studies have been held on Saturdays and Sundays, and such now tend to interfere with the advertising of the public meetings, instead of dropping them, efforts should be made to make the back-calls and conduct these book studies during the week. In our efforts to find more interest we should not neglect that which we have already found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, there are five evenings in the week in addition to our weekends, all of which should be devoted to Theocratic interests. After individual study and the service meeting are accounted for we should still have two or three evenings for the making of back-calls and the conducting of book studies. Every company should have a back-call night which should be well supported by all the publishers. During May, particularly, this back-call night can be well spent by following up the interest manifested by all subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> endeavoring to interest them in a book study, and inviting them to the nearest company-established book study and the Kingdom Hall studies and meetings. In fact, all the names on the back-call files should be called upon and invited to the public meeting. The back-call servant should see that this is done, for he has on file the names of all such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Offers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the month of May, in addition to supporting the public meeting campaign and keeping up our interest at back-calls and book studies, all Theocratic servants will also witness to the uttermost parts of their territories by engaging in the regular house-to-house activity, offering the bound book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The, Kingdom Is at Hand’’</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">One World. One, Government.</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of 25c. Where the bound book cannot be placed a diligent effort should be made to leave the booklet. When covering the same territory week after week in connection with the public meeting campaign, other offers may be used, such as three booklets on a l()c contribution, and two bound books and two booklets on a contribution of fifty cents, etc. The goal for which each Kingdom witness should strive is that of a well-balanced service schedule: Hack-calls and book studies (preferably during the week), street magazine and leaflet distribution, and the regular house-to-house work, using all to support the public meeting campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The eleven apostles to whom Jesus gave the commission to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth, and who then saw him ascend into heaven, carried out that commission in a miniature way. And though only a handful, and the whole world arrayed against them, they did not become weak in faith nor weary in well-doing, but diligently and boldly, with the help of the holy spirit, spread the gospel far and wide.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The remarks by the chairman, while only few in number, should be very carefully thought out and prepared. He is not to review the talk that has already been covered by the speaker, but he is to call attention to the fact that our object is to aid persons of good-will who are striving to understand the purposes of the Lord. To this end Scriptural questions will be entertained and answered by competent ministers, and the chairman will indicate where these ministers are located. Announce future meetings. If the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study follows, invite the public to stay for it. Invite them to the service meeting and the company book-study meetings, and explain the nature of these meetings. Announce the following public talk, and invite the interested ones to return next week and bring their friends. Prepare these announcements as carefully as the speaker prepares his talk, and deliver them just as clearly and coherently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The company publishers will do their share by thoroughly advertising the meeting, and then arriving on time so as not to disturb the proceedings. Fill the front seats first, and support the speaker’s efforts by giving rapt attention to the message as it is delivered. Children can be supervised and kept orderly by their parents, and everyone be on the alert to welcome and set at ease the strangers. Make them fee) glad they came, extend a welcome hand to them, and be at all times really to answer their questions. The Lord’s blessings are clearly manifest upon this feature of Kingdom service. All reports from all parts of the country testify to its expansion and increase. Let everyone fully share in gospel-preaching and rejoice in the Lord’s favor so clearly shown upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every company holding public meetings will report the results on the lower left-hand corner of the company monthly report card. Just show two items: Number of public meetings held and the total attendance. For instance, if a company conducts two series of four lectures during the month, with an attendance of 100 at each meeting, it would be reported thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Total public meetings 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Total attendance 800</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Rush” handbill orders, sent in to be filled at the last minute, work quite a strain on the factory staff and equipment, and, in addition, are very expensive to ship.

When blank handbills are needed, please tell us the date of the meetings for which they will be used, so that they can be shipped to you in time to have the additional information inserted. So that companies will have sufficient order blanks on hand for other handbill orders, beginning April 1 the Society will include a supply of order blanks with the printed handbills.

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>In Regard</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>to Service Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">All attenders of the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly centering at Buffalo, N. Y., last August will well remember the model service meeting conducted there. As you recall it, remember how all were there on time, that no one came in late? Promptly, at the scheduled time, after a song was sung, the meeting was opened with prayer to Jehovah. Following that, the day’s text from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> was read and the comments thereon. The company servant in his opening remarks then tied in with the theme of the day’s text a welcome to the “stranger&quot; in attendance. The outline of the service meeting program was then given. Each one assigned followed In his order, properly presented his article because he had prepared fully in advance, took the assigned amount of time, no more, no less. Each assignee tied in his consideration with that of the one preceding him. making the meeting as a whole coherent. Then the closing announcements, next week’s service meeting program, the coming week’s Theocratic activity and arrangements for service, were made, after which a song followed and the meeting was closed with prayer. &quot;Examine yourselves,” and see if your company is conforming to the model set at the Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In connection with service meetings, it would be well for all publishers, particularly the servants, to read again the articles dealing with service meetings that appear in the January and the February, 1944, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">In formant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That their service duties may be properly cared for, the appointed servants and their assistants should make it a point to be on hand at company headquarters with their records at least fifteen minutes prior to each service and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">meeting, and earlier if possible. It is not possible to handle one's assignment properly if appearance is put in just prior to the beginning of the meeting and such one leaves immediately thereafter. For a servant, then, being &quot;on time” would mean being there at least fifteen minutes early and staying until his duties are properly cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a service meeting in April a capable brother should be assigned the article in the 1945 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font4">&quot;The Field,” pages 50-52. This should be considered in accord with the instructions appearing in the January, 1945, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keep always in mind that the service meeting is the point where you learn how to put into practical application your commission to ‘go and disciple all the nations’. It is there where instructions on the new public meeting campaign are given, and for you to properly handle your assignment requires your presence at such meeting. Make it your business to be on time, participate in the meeting, pay close attention, take notes, and thus make it your own. Also, make it your business to ‘welcome the stranger’ to the service meetings and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">studies the same as you do at the public meetings.</span></p>

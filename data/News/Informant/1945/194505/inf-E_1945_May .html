<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnesses to the End of the Earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Going to Be One in May?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Holy Spirit Moves His Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to Faithful Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What an inspiring picture is presented in the text selected to guide us for the month of May I What glorious prospects arise in contemplation of the increase and prosperity that shall come to Jehovah’s organization through the energizing power of his holy spirit! 'With the old world lined up in opposition and the majority of men determined to preserve and perpetuate the present evil way, Jehovah's zealous servants are assured that through the holy spirit’s power they shall be used as his witnesses to the uttermost parts of the earth.—Acts 1: 8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font5"> 8. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This clearly proves that regardless of the attempts of men to settle the issue of world domination there is another class who will boldly stand up for Jehovah’s side of the issue. Let these now rejoice in the knowledge that their activity shall flourish and prosper. Jehovah’s true worship shall be extended to the remotest ends of the earth. Let those who now love the Lord rise up in their zeal for his cause. Energized by the power of the holy spirit, break through the enemy’s ranks, beat down their opposition. Lift high the standard of Jehovah, and during the month of May take part in every feature of Kingdom activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Pace with the Expansion of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">All </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Features</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Slay will mark the introduction of a bound book and booklet offer. Present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand” </span><span class="font5">and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span><span class="font5"> on a 25c contribution; other combinations may be offered also, as outlined in the April </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font5"> Entered into with the same zeal that marked the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign. May's field service prospects look very bright indeed. It is hoped, of course, that many more publishers will share in this month's opportunities, and perhaps some figures on what was done during the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign will inspire everyone to further zealous action. In this country alone, at the time of writing this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> over 1311,000 new subscriptions have been entered, with thousands more in the mail and going through the office. In addition, Jehovah has broken the bands that formerly restrained the activity of his people in many countries, and now thousands of new subscriptions are beginning to pour in from all parts of the English-and Spanish-speaking world. Other lands, too, will open up in his due time, until all the earth shall be involved in the all-important issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All those new subscribers are prospects for back-calls and home Bible studies. So are the people of good-will now coming to the public lectures. Therefore, instead of decreasing, the back-call and bookstudy work should and must now increase. In order for these “other sheep” to take the right side of the issue, they must be thoroughly instructed and taught the truth. There is only one people on earth today commissioned of the Lord to do this instructing, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses. During the month of May, if every publisher will hold at least one book study a week, and all the pioneers increase their book studies proportionately, it will mark a wonderful increase in this vital educational activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone Can Have an Abundant Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Squarely in line with the privilege of lifting up Jehovah's standard is the public meeting campaign. There is no able-bodied witness in any place where these meetings are being held that need deprive himself of an abundant share in this joyful line of activity. The way is now thrown wide open for everybody who claims to love the Lord to at least advertise these meetings, and attend them fully determined to be of assistance to those of good-will who attend. Everyone so doing may count the time thus spent, and this alone should account for a great increase in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Combine the distribution of handbills with magazine street work. Offer the magazines and handbills to the people; let them know that you are standing up in support of Jehovah's side of the issue, and invite them to do likewise. Some new publishers may commence their field activity by merely distributing handbills to the people; but they will soon learn how to carry literature along also, and how to present this to the people. Gradually they will learn how to recognize goodwill interest and make back-calls. Eventually they will be able to conduct book studies and thus experience the joy of being a fully rounded-out minister, apt to teach, used by the Lord to aid others. During this month of May, every regular publisher, all who have previously been irregular, and even the formerly inactive ones, have every reason to express their appreciation for the joy and blessings received at the company meetings on April 27-29, by uniting in a faithful manifestation to men everywhere that as Jehovah’s witnesses they will uphold his side of the issue. What a fine opportunity for all the regular publishers and the servants of every company to render assistance to the new ones I Extend to such a helping hand, show them how to become active publishers, let the w’eak grow strong, and the strong become stronger, and all together press ahead as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the old world set forth its claims; let them build up to high heaven, if they wish, and desperately strive to perpetuate their evil rule. Almighty God will break them in pieces and bring into full sway his rule above their ruins. The barriers that would prevent active proclamation of this fact must be pushed </span><span class="font4">aside. Not in our own strength or</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Be a Summer Vacation Pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt the goal of all youthful witnesses of Jehovah is to be a full-time, year-round minister of the gospel when they become older. What better training could these have than that of spending from two to three months each year in the full-time service until such time as they would be free and able to devote all their time and energy to the service of the King and his kingdom? The summer vacation pioneer arrangement provides this opportunity. Last year there were 392 who took advantage of this arrangement. How many will there be this year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You have youth and you have health. You have agreed to do Jehovah’s will and have symbolized that consecration by water immersion. You have dedicated your all to God’s service, and that includes primarily your time and your strength. To the extent that you appreciate the great privilege of bringing honor to his name and comfort to men of goodwill, to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that extent</span><span class="font5"> you will seriously consider the call to use your all in full-time service this summer. Enroll in June and continue until September in joyous full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In becoming a summer vacation pioneer you will not have to leave your home, but you can continue to witness in the very territory in which you now live. Thus after school begins you can continue to feed the &quot;sheep” you have found, thereby helping to increase your Kingdom interests throughout the year. Your literature you will obtain from a near-by pioneer. Write now for your vacation pioneer application blank. (For further and detailed information on the summer vacation pioneer arrangement, please see June 1944 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Full-Time Kingdom Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is the most desirable treasure for which any consecrated servant of the Most High God can strive. It brings that joy and peace that comes from the conviction that we are using our faculties, whether they be great or small, in accordance with the divine will and in the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> there is enclosed a letter to all companies regarding the desirability of participating in the pioneer service. This letter should be read at the first service meeting and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font5">study after it is received and then be studied and discussed at the following service meeting. A competent brother, either servant or experienced pioneer, should be assigned to that portion of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">power, but through the power of His holy spirit or energizing force, everyone can gladly serve throughout the month of May. Attaining a peak of publishers is not so important. What is essential, though, is that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> claiming to love Jehovah will do his will. Publishers, witnesses of Jehovah everywhere, arise </span><span class="font4">and take His side of the issue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distributors’ Order Blanks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new order blank, complete with all necessary instructions, has now been provided for all companies and pioneers to simplify the ordering of magazine distributors’ copies and extra copies. (Samples enclosed) This form has many advantages over the former order blank, as it contains at least five distinct improvements that will greatly expedite magazine ordering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should always be used when ordering magazines. Different sections are provided in which to indicate what you require. Clearly print the name of the company or pioneer in the space provided at the top of the form, and then set out the complete name and address of the person who is to receive the magazines. After this, select that section dealing with your particular kind of order and show plainly therein what you require. So doing, there should be very little difficulty experienced in obtaining what you order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each section of the order blank is self-explanatory, and complete instructions are given on these different features to insure exactness in ordering. First comes the provision for making a change of address. If you want an increase or decrease in the number of magazines formerly received, you use the next section. If the order is an entirely new one, show that fact by entering the quantity in the place provided on the right-hand side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next two sections are for foreign-language or special issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">As there is room for but one foreign-language or special issue to be shown on each form, it will be necessary to list additional kinds on separate forms. However, when many varieties are needed, list them on a suitable sheet of paper and attach it to the order blank. In addition, i read the printed instructions on the । reverse side. Please make all orders neat and plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have Your 1945 Calendar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every Kingdom Hall, each individual publisher, and each person of good-will should have a 1945 Service Calendar in use. Placed in a prominent place, not only is the calendar an advertisement of the Kingdom but it keeps before those around it the text for the year, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,” as well as showing the monthly slogans and texts and the Testimony periods as they come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you have not obtained your copy of the Calendar, and/or if you know of any of good-will desiring one or more, you are urged to place your order witli the stock servant immediately, so that the company can include the order with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> current company order for literature. In lots of less than five, the calendars are placed at 25c each. Lots of five or more to the same address are </span><span class="font4">placed </span><span class="font5">at 20c each. The Society has on hand an adequate supply. Therefore, we can fill your order just as soon as </span><span class="font4">received, as long as our supply lasts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah's impelling, stimulating, active force moves his organization of devoted servants on in the fulfillment of tlieir commission, and that commission is set forth clearly in the text for June:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“This gospel</span><span class="font5"> of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24 : 14, A. A&gt;'. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V.,</span><span class="font5"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">June, 1945, marks the sixth month of the ever-increasing public meeting campaign announcing that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. It will also witness the beginning of the greatest summer campaign of public preaching, from house-to-house, in the &quot;marketplaces&quot;, making back-calls, conducting book studies, and from the public platform, that the servants of Jehovah God have seen and been privileged to be used in to date. By this time eoni-you will be able to give an effective testimony to the meek hearer.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">organized for the public meeting work and will be able to proceed without waste of motion in arranging for tlie increase of the public witness tills summer. As soon as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> is received, if you have not already done so, definite plans should be made and followed through to tlie end that June will be the greatest month of Kingdom work to date, and that an all-time high in hours may be reached. Just think, it has been five years ago । tliis month (June) that tlie previous peak in hours was reached, namely, June, 1940, the peak being 20.31 I That was the month that organized mob-action broke out against the servants ot God and conditions were not nearly so favorable as they are now. Through support of the. public meetings on week-ends and the back-calls made during the week and studies conducted, publishers should be able to average at least 30 hours. By your having part in the advertising of tlie meeting and aiding new ones present, tlie Lord has arranged for you to count the hour spent attending the lecture, and that alone is four hours per month. Travel time of a maximum of one hour per day (if that much time is consumed traveling) can be counted also. By careful planning on the part of tlie servants in tlie company and by- personal assistance of tlie publishers and newly associated on the part of the study conductors, and by tlie individual publishers’ support of the arrangements made to publish, not only can an all-time peak in hours be reached in June but also a peak of publishers will be reporting as well.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many thousands of meek people of good-will who are seeking after the Ixird Jehovah, if</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">imply they’ might find Him. The Lord. aware fully, has provided another instrument that they may certainly find him. and that is the new booklet released at tlie April special company meetings, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth.’</span><span class="font5"> From cover through contents this publication strikes the mind of the meek because of its logical presentation of facts and the promises of God to the 'meek of the earth'. You heard tlie lecture at the special company-meetings and have now read and studied the booklet carefully. Having tlie information clearly in mind,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The cover picture well Illustrates the certain hope set out for the person of good-will seeking righteousness. Well does it picture the sure condition of the meek survivors of Armageddon in the cleansed earth of peace and righteousness. The contents of the booklet, the theme of which is the words of Jesus in his sermon on tlie mount, “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth,” show that despite the plans of men to dominate the earth and take the inheritance from the Meek Inheritor, the “heir of all things”, Christ Jesus, “the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace”. This is well portrayed in the cover illustration. Jehovah’s supremacy and his universal domination are clearly set forth, and the fact that “the kingdom is at hand” is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This booklet will be released to the public in the regular distribution in June. The offer will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’</span><span class="font5"> and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot; </span><span class="font5">on a contribution of 25c.

<p><span class="font5">liemember, the question facing us in regard to our commission is not, Can we do it? The question is, Who will have a part in the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy which is our text of the month, with all the blessedness that it means for taking part therein? It will include all publishers if ail appreciate the opportunity at hand and discharge their obligations according to the unqualified consecration to do the will of God that each one has made. The words of our service text are a </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">command</span><span class="font5"> to those serving Jehovah now, when the prophecy is being and is to be completely fulfilled. Indeed, the Kingdom has been established! It is at hand 1 The time is at hand to preach “this gospel” of a specific thing, the gospel that could not be preached prior to the King's coming and the Kingdom's establishment.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>All Should Be Engaging Therein</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Mighty as a torrential downpour, and with constantly increasing velocity, the powerful waters of truth sweep through the land washing away the filthy religious doctrines that have contaminated the earth, and providing refreshing life-giving nourishment for those who love righteousness and truth. This, brethren, is the effect of tlie greatest public meeting campaign in history. This is undoubtedly’ a most effective instrument employed by Jehovah’s witnesses to magnify His name. Therefore it is of the greatest importance that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">erery</span><span class="font5"> individual publisher and servant becomes thoroughly familiar with all the details of his part and responsibility in the campaign and then carries them out. “The steps of a good inau are ordered [established] by the Loan.” (I’s. 37:23) Therefore, let your course of action be directed (or ordered, established) not by any previous course, or personal preferences, but by the Lord's spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Proper Procedure</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By this time, all companies, regardless of size, should have participated in tlie publie meeting campaign to some extent. The servants are to see that the work is properly-organized, that the territory is divided up properly so that it can be worked thoroughly and effectively, that the advertising is pushed with vigor, that halls and meetings are of such a pleasing and inviting nature that people will want to return, and that the interest is properly followed up.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Publishers, if they wish, may vertise the public meeting in campaign territory all during week prior to the public lecture by distributing handbills while they engage in house-to-house witnessing. However, on Saturday and Sunday everyone will push the advertising.

<p><span class="font5">Saturday is usually the best day for public advertising. At strategic points near the hall publishers should be assigned street witnessing positions to offer magazines and pass out handbills all day Saturday. Other publishers should distribute them from store to store in connection with store-to-store magazine work each week. Some will be assigned to wear placards (where such placards are available) on the streets and pass out handbills.

Similarly, work a different part of the territory on Sunday, presenting the literature and then the handbill. Thus, you will be covering the same territory four times in four w-eeks. All territory assigned to that lecture series should be covered once each week. The territory servant may regulate the size of territory to be covered so that it will not be too much nor too little for the brethren to work once a week.

Kind and courteous ushers should be on duty to keep order and aid strangers to their seats, as well as answer questions. All other publishers should be there early so as to get acquainted with the strangers. Don't wait until time for the lecture to enter and take your seats. All halls should be clean and neatly arranged, presenting a pleasing appearance. After the lecture be sure to mingle with the strangers and discuss the lecture and the Kingdom with them and arrange to make back-calls on them. Invite them to return again. Each publisher should realize that his duty at the public meeting is to aid the stranger; and he will, therefore, postpone the getting of literature, magazines, renewing territory, making out field service reports, back-call slips, etc., until some other more convenient time, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(lire all your attention to the good-will!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The very purpose of these meetings is to feed the “other sheep” and aid them to learn of Jehovah’s kingdom. Our work in that respect </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">just begins</span><span class="font5"> with tlie public lectures. It requires much follow-up work with additional literature, phonograph recordings, and particularly studies in tlie Society's publications, to properly &quot;feed my sheep” as the Lord directs. These back-calls and associate with Jehovah's people and participate in their joys and bless-them on the monthly report card to the Society. That is, if a public series is put on by’ a company, tlie company will report the lecture; if sponsored by special pioneers or general pioneers, then they will report the lectures at the end of the month, regardless of who else may have participated and assisted them in the meetings. Always be sure to report total number of meetings and total attendance on your monthly report cards.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Public Meeting Campaign Gaining Momentum</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Today, when men are planning their “one world”, when the “abomination of desolation” rises out of the bottomless pit, and when all peoples of earth are being regimented to serve that which sets forth promises based only on “principle” and not on facts, the words of the Good King Christ Jesus apply with telling force: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” They speak with such force now because of their particular application to this “time of the end”, and because the only means of protection His servants have from the wild ride of the “peace beast” is that they be constantly busy ‘dis-cipling the nations’, promoting first the interests of God’s kingdom under Christ. Are you making a sincere, conscientious, well-planned effort to place your faculties and use your energy entirely, first, last and all the time, on the side of the “One Government”, The Theocracy, ‘seeking first the kingdom’? Of the various groups portrayed on the March service poster, into which one do you fall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Feast the 28th</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In remembrance of the King Christ Jesus, who held first the kingdom of God even unto death and who was rewarded the first place at the “right hand of God”, his followers and companions will celebrate the Memorial March 28. after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Full preparations should be made in advance for this joyous event. A competent brother of the anointed (if available) will be chosen to deliver the discourse. Real red wine and unleavened bread should be provided. All new interest and “strangers” in the territory will be invited and urged to attend. At the public meeting on Sunday prior to the Wednesday of the Memorial, an announcement should be made inviting all those present to attend such celebration. On Memorial day and the four days following the Memorial, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, special arrangements should be made to get all “new interest” and all associated out in the service. Arrange for special group activity’, advertising on Thursday and Friday the public meeting for the following Sunday, as well as on the usual days of Saturday and Sunday. Handbill distribution will be an effective means of “breaking in” some of the new ones in service activity. Also, engage in the presentation of the current offer. Sunday, April 1, the start of the “United Kingdom An-nouncebs” Testimony Period should see all publishers out in the field, with a peak in publishers already reached for March. With a sincere, conscientious, well-planned effort at ‘seeking first the kingdom’, all these things will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> each company will find one “1945 Memorial Report” card. The company servant should make provision to care for the counting of the attendance at Memorial, including partakers. Immediately after the Memorial the card should be made out, a stamp placed thereon, and mailed to the Society. Please do not enclose it in an envelope. This will greatly facilitate the compiling of the 1945 Memorial report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Third Month of “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During March, as you go forth ‘seeking first the kingdom’, announcing its establishment to those in your territory, you will present the offer of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine at the subscription rate of $1.00 petyear and give the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span><span class="font3"> free with the subscription. By Jehovah's grace and the persistent effort of all publishers to ‘seek first the kingdom’, all inhabitants of your territory will receive the opportunity to obtain this offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports at hand at the time of this writing on the 1945 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toicer</span><span class="font3"> Campaign are very gratifying, even though incomplete. The incomplete report for January already shows 24,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions, not to mention the 10,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and foreign-language magazine subscriptions put through. Due to the tremendous load on the office in handling these subscriptions, each publisher should advise the subscriber that it will be approximately one month before the subscription gets through. In the interim, a good opportunity is open for the publisher to call back, present the current magazine, and endeavor to start a book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers can be of great assistance to the office here if they will observe closely the following in filling out the subscription slips: (1) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Make writing legible. Print if possible.</span><span class="font3"> (2) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Send original subscription slip if legible and neat. If recopied, please typewrite or print, and then check.</span><span class="font3"> (3) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Do not abbreviate names of cities. Write them out in full.</span><span class="font3"> (4) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Give postal zone number, if known. If not known, do not put anything in that space.</span><span class="font3"> Do </span><span class="font2">NOT GUESS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting Campaign Gaining Momentum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Throughout the land companies are renting halls and expanding their efforts in announcing “The kingdom of heaven is at hand!” by</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Benefits Resulting to Companies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah promised long ago, through the prophet Isaiah, that for brass he would bring gold within his organization, and for iron he would bring silver; or, in other words, the organization would improve and prosper. The brethren everywhere regard the longer visits by the servants to the brethren as an evidence of these improved conditions, and they hail the provision with joy. They know that now is the time to look for vast expansion, now is the time to overcome all hindrances and restraints, and burst forth on the right hand and on the left, with a great increase of activity. They see how the increased assistance from the servants to the brethren will aid the companies everywhere to swing into the mighty forward movement of Jehovah’s organization as it advances in offensive action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How Improvements Will Be Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With more time at his disposal, the servant to the brethren will go thoroughly into every feature of company organization, explaining to each servant how to rightly use all forms and discussing the inmeans of the public meetings. Reports are constantly coming in telling of the great number of “strangers” and good-will interest attending for the first time a lecture given by a representative of the Society. Not only the first time, but these “strangers” manifest their continued interest by repeated attendance at the meetings. Many millions of handbills have already been printed and shipped to companies in the United States. Truly, the electrifying cry, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand I” is being heralded nationwide. This great witness, which has just begun, is ‘not [accomplished] by might, but by [Jehovah’s] spirit’. Are you, as a company, pioneer group or pioneer, making plans for and engaging in this public means of testifying that the Kingdom is established and is at hand? Are you making a sincere, conscientious, well-planned effort to seek first the promotion of the Kingdom interests through the public meeting arrangement as outlined in the instructions already sent you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is true that to “preach publicly” will require greater sacrifice, both of time and of financial gain. However, as the expansion of the work takes place, as the Theocratic requirements expand, it is the responsibility of each Kingdom announcer to adjust his position to meet these requirements, placing the Kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">first.</span><span class="font3"> The Lord’s command to “disciple all the nations” was not qualified in the sense that it was to be done provided the means were at hand to do it Rather, “Seek ye first [the announcing of] the kingdom of God. . . . and all these things shall be added . . .” Go forward, trusting wholly in Jehovah, ‘discipling the nations’ and ‘seeking first the Kingdom’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">structions dealing with his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">specific </span><span class="font3">line of activity. He will then aid the servants to put this understanding Into practice in the company meetings. Better service meetings will result, as he will actually prepare model service meetings as patterns to be followed by the companies. A livelier interest will then be taken by all in the company. More will attend and receive complete instruction on all features of field activity, and every publisher will improve his efficiency in the field as a result of learning how to properly use the Society’s forms and apply </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The same is true of the company study meetings. The servant to the brethren will assist all companies to participate in these to the greatest good of all in attendance. He will show’ the conductors how to impress upon the brethren the need of careful preparation of the lesson in advance, so that everyone attending can answer the questions and thus all share in the food placed on the Lord’s table. This applies, of course, to all company book studies and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies. The servant to the brethren will show the companies how to take full advantage of studying God’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Word </span><span class="font3">so that everyone will increase </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">knowledge and aptitude to teach others. This is especially true of the Theocratic ministry course, and he will counsel the school servant, the students, and everyone attending, how to use the course to equip them for a full share in the present public meeting campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service Benefits</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to these features, the publishers will be personally aided by the opportunity of going into the field with the servant to the brethren for instruction In door-to-door approach to the people. He will show how to recognize and follow up all good-will interest, and how to build back-calls into book studies. He will also demonstrate how to engage in magazine street-work and store-to-store activity, and the best ways to advertise the public lectures. Thus ail features of field service and company activity will be built up and strengthened. The brethren everywhere will become better equipped to serve as ministers of the Most High God. The joyful task of ‘discipling all nations’ will go grandly on until a great multitude from every nation, kindred, tribe, and tongue will have come forward and taken their stand for the Kingdom.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Greater Impetus to Public Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s faithful servants have joyfully submitted themselves to do the will of the Lord, and he Is pleased to use them to sing forth the “glad tidings”. Nothing could be accomplished without his spirit; but with it, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> things are accomplished. This is the same spirit or motivating power Jehovah used in creating the earth, in causing spirit creatures to move according to his divine will, in directing the course of the faithful men of old; this same spirit is now the guiding force that directs faithful creatures in the path of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">Campaign and public meeting campaign to date show that there is an abundance of his spirit upon his servants, and he has richly rewarded their efforts with much Joy and comfort of mind. The results have been far above anything ever before realized. Yes, the spirit of the Lord is what has united the Kingdom announcers Into one solid working unit witli one mind and one purpose: to go forth and disciple all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One who is truly guided by that spirit will at all times remain in harmony and unity with it He will not let other things disunite or separate him from the full exercise of that spirit Do not restrain or repress the action of the spirit that impels you to perform the Lord’s will, but Joyfully yield to its leading and direction, and watch the Lord’s blessing upon your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Climax of “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The month of April will bring the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign to a grand climax. During that month we hope to see a greater number of people of good-will subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> than in any one month in the past. If you have not yet met your quota of subscriptions, now is a good time to put forth more effort to attain that goal. Those who have met the quotas can double their efforts and enjoy an extra portion of the Lord’s blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let’s make April the peak month in subscriptions. Go forth with the full campaign offer and cover the territory thoroughly. Let everyone in the territory have a chance to accept the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription offer. The offer will continue to be one year’s subscription for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine at the regular rate of $1.00, but with the premium offer of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public meeting campaign is progressing remarkably well, and the results are astounding. Many people have returned to hear more talks and attend other meetings. Some companies have reported more strangers attending their publicmeetings than publishers. This is truly the Lord’s provision for directing thousands into the way of life; perhaps eventually millions of people of good-will now ensnared by religion, or otherwise. With the public meeting campaign getting better organized, it seems that the Lord’s organization is due to give a tremendous public witness during the coming year. Everyone in the company should, therefore, let himself be guided by the holy spirit and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he a publisher in April,</span><span class="font3"> and every month thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising can be put on on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">large scale. Where possible compa</span><span class="font3">nies may have information walking in the business districts with placards. Work the stores with magazines and handbills, place placards in store windows, pass out handbills from house to house, on the streets, at intersections, etc. Brethren should talk about the public meetings wherever they go and to whomever they meet. There is no limit in this advertising work. Let all far and wide know that they are welcome to attend a free public meeting, which Is for their welfare. When summer comes, if you have difficulty in obtaining halls, go to public parks, bandstands, vacant lots, public pavilions, or any other place you can find where you can gather together a group of people and talk to them about the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been noted that many publishers fail to bring their book-study attendants and back-call Interest to the public meetings. Every effort should be made to get these people to attend each public talk, regardless of what territory they live in. They already have some knowledge and appreciation of the truth. Publishers, give these interested ones your close attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">United for Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are united together in the spirit of the Lord. Their answer to Jesus' command. “Go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand,” is their united response to joyfully proclaim the Kingdom message to others, thus having a share in directing to the way of life millions of sincere truthseekers who are now blinded by the brilliant attractions of this old world. Let Jehovah’s spirit guide you to action. Be a publisher ‘preaching the kingdom of heaven is at hand’. Will you respond in April?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Information on Public Meeting Campaign </span><span class="font3">Surely no work being attempted or accomplished in the strength of man can compare with the activity in which Jehovah’s servants are engaged and which they are doing by the power of his active force. Without question, theirs is the most important work. Theirs alone brings honor to Jehovah's name and works toward its vindication; theirs alone brings benefits of lasting value to all men of good-will as well as to those engaging therein. This being the case, it at once becomes apparent that all who engage in this work should do so with carefulness, earnestness, and thoroughness. Yes, each and every servant of the Lord should take every feature of the work seriously so that his efforts may prove acceptable to the Great Master whom he has covenanted to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the public meeting campaign gains momentum, and the brethren become more proficient in it, questions arise and weaknesses become apparent, which it seems well to consider at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How Assigned; Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The question has been raised as to what constitutes being “assigned” to a lecture series. Where only one meeting is being held at a time, all the publishers in the company or unit are in line to support that series. All who agree to and then do take part in advertising that meeting and support it are considered as assigned to that meeting and may count the time spent in attending that meeting as field service. This would also, of course, include those who call for good-will interest and bring them to the meetings. In fact, this method of calling for the goodwill has been found to be one of the most effective means of ‘welcoming the stranger’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where more than one meeting is being held at a time, as previously instructed, the servants should arrange to assign certain publishers to the advertising and support of each series so that each meeting will be properly advertised and have a proportionate number of publishers in attendance. Each one should feel it his obligation and responsibility to support this meeting, and, when given an assignment, should be depended upon to carry It out And such attendance at these meetings should not be governed by personal preference for the speaker, but by a Theocratic assignment, an appointment coming through the local Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another question arises as to the manner of distribution of the advertising leaflets. These should be distributed on the street corners and from store to store and house to house on Saturday, and when presenting the literature in the regular house-to-house work on Sunday. When these are distributed from house to house they should always be handed to the householder, and not merely slipped under the door, unless the householder does not respond to the knock or ring. Those engaging in regular house-to-house activity during the week may distribute these leaflets also, provided the territory is accessible to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kingdom Halls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A weakness that has become very apparent as a result of the public meeting series is the appearance of some of the Kingdom Halls. In fact, in some places these actually constitute a reproach to the glad tidings of the Kingdom. The Kingdom Hall is the headquarters of the Theocratic Interests, the center of Kingdom activity in a city, and it should be a place dear to our hearts; and we should show our fondness of this place by looking well to Its appearance, as well as by regularly attending there. As the psalmist of' old, we should be glad when the time comes to go to the house of the Lord. The typical house of the Lord was made according to His specifications and was a place befitting its purpose. Our Kingdom Halls of today should likewise have an appearance befitting their purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While not all of the Lord’s people may be in position to provide for as good a Kingdom Hall as they would like to have, yet, regardless of their financial condition, the Kingdom Hall should always be arranged in an orderly and neat manner and kept clean. Where arrangements to do this systematically have not already been put into effect, provisions should be made to do so at once. No doubt all of the Lord's servants will be glad to have a share in this privilege of service, and by all doing so it will present no great burden to any one, nor interfere to any great extent with one’s time for study and service in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By noting the above as well as all the details and taking every feature of the public meeting campaign seriously, we shall have the Lord’s approval upon our activity, will see his blessing upon our efforts, and will also be maintaining our integrity.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Items to Note</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">All companies, pioneers, and other brethren writing the Society should place their full name and address in the upper right-hand corner of the sheet Do that in every case, particularly if you wish an answer. Inquiries regarding subscriptions that have been sent to this office will not be answered unless some specific abnormal condition exists that requires an answer. Otherwise, the magazine leaving here regularly will be the answer to your inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When inquiry is made about a subscription sent to this office and you receive another renewal slip in the meantime, ignore the latest renewal slip. The fact that the magazine is being mailed to you regularly is the answer to your Inquiry. Possibly the renewal slip was on the way before your Initial inquiry received attention, as such notices are prepared in advance.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Special Letters</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> are letters addressed to the special pioneers, general pioneers, and to the company publishers. All of these letters should be carefully and prayerfully considered by those to whom they are addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The letter to the special pioneers lias to do with their activity during the past year and the Lord's very evident blessing upon their efforts. It also contains suggestions for closer co-operation and unity among the specials themselves and between the specials and the other branches of the Theocratic organization with which they are required to work in carrying on the Kingdom service. Careful consideration of all the material therein will be of great benefit to all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The letter to the general pioneers similarly outlines for their consideration the Lord's blessing and guidance upon that branch of the service during the past year, and the absolute need for unity now in order to have the Lord’s blessing. Each pioneer should carefully study this letter and examine himself in the light of the facts presented. Be sure that you are co-operating fully in advancing the Kingdom interests in unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The letter addressed to the company publishers and sent to each company for collective consideration and discussion calls attention to the great privilege of pioneer service now for those who are in position to avail themselves of it This letter should be read at the first </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study and at the first service meeting after it is received, then at the second service meeting after it is received it should be carefully studied and discussed. Some competent Theocratic-minded servant should have charge of this period and devote fifteen or twenty minutes to a clear presentation of the advantages of the pioneer service. Questions should be encouraged and asked by the brethren in the audience. A real effort should be made to place all the facts pertaining to the pioneer service clearly before all.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Reports Important</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Total number of public meetings held and total attendance at these meetings should be reported on lower left-hand corner of monthly field service report. All who have neglected to do this should send this information at once on a postal card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All pioneers living in isolated territory and having a Memorial meeting should report on a postal card the total attendance and the total number of partakers.</span></p>

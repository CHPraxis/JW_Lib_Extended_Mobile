<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Overseers, Assistants Take Lead; All Servants Join in Effort</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The term “servaul&quot; is full of meaning to those who cleave to the Theocratic organization. and it takes on more and more significance as the light from Jehovah's temple shines continually brighter. Every consecrated, active individual among I he Lord’s people now appreciates more fully that his chief aim and greatest privilege is to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">serve</span><span class="font3"> in the ministry by going into the field— door to door, village to village, city to city, in the homes and publicly— with the proclamation &quot;The kingdom is at hand I” To the end that his ‘light might shine’ more brilliantly, the servaul of the Lord is careful to conform closely to the Theocratic lead regarding organization. equipment, and direction for the final work. He is ready, alert, vigilant, and he proceeds with full (aith in the work of ‘discipling of nil nations'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In these &quot;last days&quot; the Theocratic organization in the earth moves ahead in bold offensive! Jehovah has given the command, his King takes the lead, and every faithful servant is in his place, functioning according to his assignment and heme sustained by the spirit of the Lord. The overseers &lt;epixA*opos) and assistants </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(diakonos</span><span class="font3"> 1 in the company organizations know their respective duties and move ahead with confidence in the task at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Threefold Line of Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the February &quot;Theocratic Servants” Testimony Period those who are faithfully proclaiming the Kingdom as at hand will be carrying forward a threefold work: ( 1) They will be wholeheartedly participating in the public meeting campaign. The companies countrywide are by now fully occupied with advertising the lecture series, and competent Theoeratic-ministry-trained servants are delivering with felling effect the message so vital to the people at this time. That the brethren everywhere have taken hold of this new work and are pushing it with enthusiasm and zeal peculiar to the Lord's house is clearly shown by handbill orders already in the Society’s office, more than eleven million having been ordered at the printing of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> Early reports show that the meetings are being well attended and many &quot;strangers” are enjoying these public talks. Push ahead with full trust in the Lord! (2) In the door-to-door and back-call activity, and even in the street magazine-work, they are featuring rhe </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoirer</span><span class="font3"> subscription for one year, at the regular subscription rate of a dollar, but with “77ie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kinffdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span><span class="font3"> given free. Diligent presentation of the offer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Spearheads Campaign</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">at every home will mean more subscriptions. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Present the offer! </span><span class="font3">(3) The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World. One Government</span><span class="font3"> is being placed in every home possible and with every individual who will read It, on a small contribution or free. One world, under one perfect and abiding Government of righteousness, is the certain destiny of all men of good-will. Let them know that its realization is near. Ten million copies are ready for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Points to Observe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society's printing facilities are hard put to turn out these handbills in good time for the meetings. It is not possible to tell in advance whether the handbills will be sent by mail or express; so, after a reasonable time, the brethren should inquire at the express office concerning their expected shipments. By so doing, two or three days may be saved; for the express office usually sends out a notice to the consignee when a shipment arrives, thereby involving a delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not use anything but the Society's specially prepared “Handbill Order Blanks” when ordering handbills; otherwise it entails considerable office work and delay. Order several weeks in advance, so that ample time is allowed to get the handbills to you, and write &quot;Handbill Order&quot; in the lower lefthand corner of the envelope. Show the name of the speaker thus: J. \V. Publisher (first and second initials and last name). Do not order printed handbills in quantity’ less than 1,000. However, blank handbills may be obtained in any quantities and the needed information be filled in by the company. It is necessary, though, to specify the quantity required for each lecture, as the subject title appears on each kind of blank handbill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In answer to many* inquiries, where a lack of speakers exists: It is proper to invite capable pioneers working in your vicinity or qualified brothers from near-by companies to deliver the lectures wherever such arrangement is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The companies will profit by assigning a portion of a service meeting to the consideration of the Society's instructions on how to handle subscriptions, including rhe filling-out of the slip. Publishers, of course, will remit 75c for each new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription, retaining 25c to cover the cost of the book and booklet left with the subscriber as a premium. This arrangement applies during the special campaign only. -VII renewed subscriptions, and all new subscriptions taken at any other time during the year, will be at the usual rate of $1.00. If a person has already subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and desires to obtain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> for a year, a subscription may be taken at the same terms as the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">offer. This, too, applies only during the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has turned to his servants a pure language and has placed them in the field to declare his marvelous message of truth at the most critical time of earth's history. Why the “pure language&quot;? That they may “serve him with one consent&quot; or shoulder, putting that shoulder to the wheel of the Kingdom message and pushing with all their heart, mind, strength and soul. IZeph. 3:9) In February </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ever)/ </span><span class="font3">willing servant will participate in the threefold activity joyously, giving good proof of his ministry</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly* is past. But the joyful spirit of unbroken unity and heartfelt experiences and blessings received from that assembly will long be remembered by all who were privileged to attend. It is well for all Christian warriors to take a little time now and then to review important events in the Lord's organization. Not only should you do so privately, but, more important, you should discuss these recent events of the Lord's servants with the people of good-will, so that they may have some knowledge of His mighty works in the midst of the earth despite an all-out global war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a good supply of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> No. G55 on hand, which contains a complete report of the assembly held last August by Jehovah’s witnesses.

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Welcome the “Stranger”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Now in every part of the earth the Lord’s people are putting forth their greatest efforts to date in the ■discipling of all nations’. The public meeting campaign which has lieen added to the already well-filled program of activities of Jehovah's witnesses is the cause. It must be that the Lord’s servants are extremely busy, else the public meeting campaign could not be effec-I five. The Lord is giving His wit-I ilosses th** strength and the ability I necessary to meet the requirements I of His service. We sincerely hope our labors will bring forth much fruit to the honor of Jehovah’s name, evidence of which will be the increased number of worshipers of rhe Most High, the “strangers” in our midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After pulring forth diligent effort to help those of the &quot;siranger” class learn tlie truth (bv witnessing at the doors by inviting them to the meetings, by studies in their homes) over a period of time, it is our expectation that at least some will become associated with the various companies of Jehovah's worshipers. It is important that we recognize the necessity of exerting some effort on behalf of the “stranger” class right in our Kingdom Halls and at meetings, and not merely in the field. It is regret te&lt;l that there are some companies where, it has been reported, no warm hospitality is extended to new persons attending meetings. The large companies are apparently the ones where such has occurred. This is difficult to understand ; nevertheless, it is so. Surely anyone who manifests sufficient interest in the Kingdom to come out to a meeting of the Lord’s people ought to be shown friendliness and made to feel welcome. Brotherly love must be shown for the incoming ones too. &quot;Be kindly affeetioned one to another with brotherly love; . . . given to hospitality.” (Rom. 12; 10. 13) &quot;Your love for the brotherhood must continue. Do not forget to be hospitable to strangers, for by being so some, without knowing it, have had angels as their guests.” (Hebrews 13:1,2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed)</span><span class="font3"> We do our utmost to show the “strangers” the way to I he Lord’s organization, of which the company is a part; but if we do not welcome them when they finally get around to attending a meeting we are neglecting the &quot;stranger”. There should be no question left in the mind of any person of good-will wtio leaves any meeting place of the Lord’s people as to his being among friends while there, as well as being welcome to return for the next meeting. True, all of us are busy at meetings getting territory and literature, besides making arrangements for field service in days to come; however, we can find time for at least a word of greeting to the new ones. It should not be necessary to say more in (his matter. Each company and each publisher can and should be hospitable. lx?t us not neglect the “stranger” in our midst. Be sure you make arrangements to welcome and help the “stranger” attending your company meeting and public meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeking First the Kingdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the “Stranger” to Become a Publisher</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial, March 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today, as never before, Satan is doing all within his power to turn all mankind away from Jehovah God and to stop the work of preaching this gospel of the Kingdom, the evangel that directs all men to their Creator. On the one hand this adversary uses pressure, threats, mob action, and imprisonment, and on the other hand he uses the temptation to lay up earthly treasures and to put one’s confidence in the uncertainty of riches. Some of Jehovah’s servants who have stood firm under all manner of persecution are now weakening as to this temptation, apparently taking the viewpoint that when conditions are less favorable to the accumulation of this world’s goods they will again give the Kingdom interests more attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even if the Kingdom work were not so pressing, were there not so much to do and so few to do it, there still could be no excuse for this attitude. Kingdom publishing has always pressed for fulfillment, and now the most stupendous task ever set before imperfect human creatures is placed upon all who have undertaken to serve Jehovah. Therefore now, more than ever before, it is imperative that they be &quot;seeking first the Kingdom”, our text for the month of March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this month all Theocratic servants will seek first the Kingdom by pushing forward in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription campaign (which should be going in high gear in this, the third month), by working in their individual territory from house to house, offering the year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> (at the regular subscription rate), with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot; </span><span class="font3">and the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span><span class="font3"> As previously mentioned in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> where the householder is unable or unwilling to subscribe for the entire offer, efforts should be made to leave the book and the booklet. However, at every home and every interview leave a copy of the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span><span class="font3"> This important message should be gotten into the hands of every person in your company territory. Servants and all publishers should make arrangements to this end. All publishers will also continue to take care of their back-calls and conduct their book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They will also put the Kingdom interests first by giving enthusiastic and wholehearted support to the public meeting campaign, advertising it on the streets and from house to house on Saturday with the leaflets, and on Sunday in connection with the literature presentation. They will also attend the public meetings, bringing their good-will interest with them, and will be on the lookout to welcome the “stranger” and make him feel at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, that is not all. They must also follow in the footsteps of their great Exemplar in seeking first the Kingdom in another respect. And what is that? In assisting new ones to become publishers. Yes, He not only conducted a public meeting campaign and taught the people in their homes, but also took beginners with Him, teaching them by precept and example how to preach, and then sent them forth to ‘disciple all nations’. So this month each evangelist will put forth a special effort to help others to get started in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">March should see a peak in publishers. It is the ideal time for this, as the Memorial comes during this month. Therefore invite your goodwill interest not only to attend that meeting but also to have a part in the field service. Start them out in the leaflet distribution work, both on the streets and from house to house, and then take them with you when presenting the literature. And when doing so use the time to good advantage by counseling the new publisher as to the best way to meet the various objections and to answer the many questions one encounters while engaged in the preaching work. Such suggestions, together with a real joy in the service being apparent on your part, will go far toward making your new publisher an able and zealous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nor will we limit our assistance to such. Continually new ones are coming into the organization, symbolizing their consecration, and starting out in the field service, and yet it has been two years since we have had a peak in publishers. Why is there no increase? Is it because some are growing weary in well-doing or are becoming weak in faith, and as a result are publishing irregularly or not at all? If so, these too we must help. If we are willing to spend hours and hours in helping those of good-will by conducting book studies in their homes, certainly we should be willing, yes, anxious to spend some time and effort with those who have already taken their stand but for one reason or another have relaxed and failed to appreciate their privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, this month let every regular publisher work for a peak by assisting others to be publishers, not only those just beginning but also those weak and irregular publishers. Thus doing we not only shall be “seeking first the Kingdom” ourselves, but shall also help our brethren to do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1945 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems appropriate at this time to give consideration to what constitutes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">organization</span><span class="font3"> in the Theocracy. in order that Theocratic servants may conduct themselves according to the divine order during this “Theocratic Servants” Testimony Period and ever thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To this end that section of the 1945 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearhook</span><span class="font3"> under “Organization”, pages 22 to 29, will be considered during one of your service meetings in February.

<p><span class="font3">The above report for December shows a decrease in each and every branch of the service irom that of the previous month. While this doubtless was largely due to the cold weather setting in, yet all Kingdom publishers should bear in mind that the righteous requirements of the Lord are the same for the winter as for the summer, and that by taking proper precautions this ob-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Discipling All the Nations’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Glorious Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for Full-Time Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those present-day faithful servants of the Lord who are seeking to keep Christ’s command to ‘preach the Kingdom gospel’ are thus described in the 1945 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook:</span><span class="font3"> “Some call at farmhouses, others at apartments, and still others from house to house. In some lands it means visiting people in their adobe huts and their lean-to’s; but wherever people live, that is where Jehovah’s witnesses are directed to go: ‘Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The same general picture is conveyed by the striking illustration and text on the Society’s 1945 Calendar. In equatorial heat, or the bitter polar cold, the busy city streets, or the lonely continental plains, in every land, to every people, the message will go until all who live shall bow the knee to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a glorious prospect 1 What a desire for full-time activity is kindled in contemplation of the service privileges thus presented. Many willing ones in this day of Jehovah's power have put aside the things of the old world and taken up full-time service, and many more would do so except for the fear of being unable to support or maintain themselves as pioneers. There were those in Jesus’ day also that were hindered from following him because possessed of the same doubts, but Jesus declared that if men would seek first the Kingdom interests his Father would provide all things needful. The work of discipling all the nations includes the drawing of men from the things of the old world to God’s New World. How, then, in all consistency, can the Lord’s servants be concerned with such things as the Gentiles seek?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Referring to the position now occupied by Jehovah’s witnesses in this glorious ‘discipling’ work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for December 15, 1944, states: “Blessed is the lor of those who are sent forth and who endure in service to the end.” This statement is especially true of the one who through sheer love for God and a desire to do His will makes the decision to devote all his time and energy to serving the Lord. Tn the ranks of Jehovah’s full-time servants individuals from every condition and stage of life appear. They dwell in all parts of the earth, some in difficult, others in easier circumstances. Some are sickly, others robust; some very young, some very old: some with money, many without much money. They go forward day by day not in their own strength nor looking to the things of this world for sustenance. They would not endure unto the end if they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Their strength and support come from the Lord, who declared. ‘If the birds and even the grass of the field are provided for. how much more you, O ye of little faith?’ Yes. the lot of all sent forth as Jehovah's witnesses is blessed indeed, but manyfold more blessed is that one who becomes a full-time pioneer servant. The way is now open for all who will to “disciple all the nations&quot; as full-time servants of the Lord. Enroll and partake of God's favor and blessings to the fullest extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">staele can largely be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With every evangelist diligently looking after the good-will interest in his individual assignment as well as enthusiastically supporting the public meeting campaign, there is every reason for expecting a decided improvement in rhe field i service report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Information on Reporting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers, Pioneers, and Servants,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Study Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the man ‘clothed in linen with the writer’s inkhorn by his side’, after finishing his Theocratic assignment, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">reported</span><span class="font3"> the matter, saying, “I have done as thou hast commanded,” so Jehovah’s Theocratic servants today make reports to the Theocratic organization via their local company organization, and the pioneers direct with headquarters, as to the work they have done which the Lord has commanded them to do, to “go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Set forth below is information on the proper reporting of time for various features of Kingdom activity. and what should be reported on your field service report; also information on reporting attendance at book studies. Please study this carefully and conform to same from and after February 1, 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Time. Report time while engaged in house-to-house distribution ol handbills, folders, radio announcements, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font3"> magazines, books, booklets, and other Kingdom literature. Also, report time spent advertising the local public meeting with information signs, and passing out handbills; time spent in operating sound equipment, thus heralding the Kingdom message far and wide over the territory; also time spent in witnessing to owners of buildings, lots, etc., when arranging to secure such lots, buildings, parks, pavilions, schoolhouses, bandstands, etc., for use in connection with the public meeting campaign. Of course, time spent in regular features of the work nol mentioned above, such as back-call and book-study activity, will be reported as heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">assigned</span><span class="font3"> to work wiih a particular public meeting group may include in their service report the time spent in attending and supporting the public meeting, provided they have participated in advertising that public meeting to the best of their ability. Also, the speaker delivering the talk may count the time spent doing such, but not the time spent in preparing it. This is witnessing publicly and the time in bearing the witness is thus counted. This rule concerning the publisher’s and speaker’s counting time applies only for the public meetings, and not for regular studies and meetings in the company.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On Being Thorough</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The House to House Record form now employed by the publishers is an instrument by which thorough coverage of territory may be accomplished. When a person is too busy to receive the witness or no one is at home, notation is made on tlie form. It has been found that at about 35 percent of the homes a witness is not given the first time a territory is worked; and that is considerable. These homes should be called on again the very next time the publisher is in the territory, else the territory is really only partially worked. Many wonderful opportunities of free education are enjoyed by the publishers who are thorough. One such publisher reports placing as many as seven books in one day while calling upon those who were not at home when he first worked the territory. It is always well to go back to homes where you have not had a chance to give the Kingdom witness. Being thorough in your service will produce the most fruitful results.</span></p>

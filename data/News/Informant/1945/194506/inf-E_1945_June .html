<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Gospel” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June to See Marked Expansion of Public Meeting Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth,’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Featured</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the nations assemble (as at San Francisco) and seek human remedies for world distress (a ‘just and lasting peace' by means of a world security organization), Jehovah calls attention to Uis remedy by commanding, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony unto all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14, A.K.V., margin) The carrying out of that command is the most important work that is being done on the earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah always does his part. By setting his King upon his holy hill of Zion, he created the basis or foundation for “this gospel”. He put his spirit upon his people and commissioned them to go forth and preach “this gospel&quot;, and by his spirit or active force he sustains them in that work. And so that his servants might press on with joy and zeal and increased faith and appreciation, he provided the special company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At those meetings the servants of Jehovah were refreshed and edifled as to the privilege of presenting their bodies (including all its members and faculties) as living sacrifices. How they might perform their rational divine service was clearly and forcibly brought to their attention. They were thrilled as they heard the graphic portrayal of the part that Jehovah’s witnesses play in the great conflict for supremacy as the people for the issue, specially created for that occasion. There they heard with rapt attention the timely and comforting message “The Meek Inherit the Earth”, and received it in printed form with enthusiasm for their use in further preaching &quot;this gospel”. But above all, those special meetings will be remembered as the occasion on which Jehovah, through his “faithful and wise servant”, provided his surprised and delighted evangelists with the new instruction book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font1"> And what an instrument that is! What an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aid</span><span class="font1"> in our endeavors to measure up to the exacting terms of our commission! Yes, Jehovah always does his part I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Availing Ourselves of the Theocratic Aid</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now the issue facing us is that of applying these divinely provided instructions in the field. Throughout the month of June, all of the Lord's servants will make use of its counsel while preaching from house to house (see Lesson 50), offering the bound book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom lx at Hand”</span><span class="font1"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 25c. An earnest endeavor should be made to place one of these new booklets in each home. Where the new booklet has not yet been received, use the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Oorernment</span><span class="font1"> until it arrives. (The factory has worked extra time so as to get as many of the new booklets as possible into the hands of the publishers in time for the June campaign.) This month brings with it warmer weather and longer days, thus providing additional opportunities to preach “this gospel&quot; by engaging in the evening house-to-house work, presenting either the regular offer or the booklet alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only will the servants of Jehovah do their part by going from house to house with “this gospel”, but they will also show their appreciation of his tender compassions by calling back on all such as have shown interest and aiding them to appreciate the issue and the Kingdom. In going from house to house we are merely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">looking</span><span class="font1"> for the meek, the “other sheep”. Being meek, they are teachable; and therefore, having found them, w<sup>r</sup>e must also teach them. And having started studies with these, we must exercise care if we would have them continue. It is not enough merely to go through a routine procedure of asking the questions and then having the paragraphs read, but we must put our heart into it; teaching with am thority and conviction, making the lesson clear and interesting, and at the same time being ever alert to use Theocratic tactfulness in dealing with the many questions and Incidents that arise. That is one of the main reasons why the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font1"> was provided. Study and apply its lessons, and your back-calls and book studies will increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching “This Gospel” Publicly</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Doing our part includes also pushing forward in the public meeting campaign. Improved weather should see a decided “stepping up” in this method of preaching “this gospel&quot;. In fact, June is the ideal month for this, being neither too warm nor too cool. Therefore, do not wait any longer, but arrange </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font1"> for openair meetings in parks, pavilions, bandstands, ball parks, and where-ever suitable places can be found. Bring the lectures to the people, and thus reach many who failed to come to the lectures. At such places it would be well to attract attention by playing musical selections on a transcription machine (if one is available) for ten to fifteen minutes before the assembly begins. During this time the brethren can go around handing out leaflets and personally inviting those in the vicinity to attend the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the company has no further places available at which to put on the series, it would be well to arrange for a return series at the Kingdom Hall and other places used earlier in the year. At such places the same lectures could again be given, or, especially where the first series was limited to four lectures, the company may use new subjects for the lectures by now putting on lectures numbers 5 to 8 in this manner: “ ‘Thy Kingdom Lome’ When?” “The Bible Spotlight on Religion&quot;; “Religion’s Harvest”; “Education for Life.” Under these circumstances it is left to each company to decide whether to start again with the first talk and run the entire series or just use the last four mentioned here. Indeed there is still plenty of work for all, in the public meeting campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With each and every publisher having clearly in mind what Jehovah has done in connection with the preaching of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“this gospel”,</span><span class="font1"> and seeing the many opportunities that lie before us as co-workers with Him, there is no reason why the June Testimony period should not see a new peak in hours for all ranks of Kingdom publishers. Jehovah always does </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">His</span><span class="font1"> part. Will you do </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font1"> part?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>For the Careful Attention of Prospective Summer Vacation Pioneers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">During the past fall, winter and spring you younger brethren have diligently expended your energies learning and properly preparing yourself for future Kingdom work, and you have engaged regularly in house-to-house, back-call, book-study and magazine work with your parents and others of like precious faith in the week-day evenings and on Saturday and Sunday. Your diligent study of the course in Theocratic ministry has greatly assisted you in performing your covenanted work of preaching &quot;this gospel” to others. You clearly discern the Lord's blessing on your efforts. Now many of you are relieved from school work for the summer months. You have time on your hands. The question arises, What are you going to do with the time? Are you going to spend it in inactivity, or are you going to “redeem” it by spending it wholly in the Lord’s service as a pioneer, a summer vacation pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">David answered a similar question by devoting his entire time to the service of Jehovah while but a youth. As a young man he proved his faith by works, his utter dependence upon the Lord’s guiding, active force, when he walked out without fear of man and met the challenge of the Devil’s representative, Goliath. Many years later, when he was an old, grayhaired man, David said, “For thou art my hope. O Lord Gou: thou art my trust from my youth.” He had devoted himself to the glorious service of making known Jehovah’s judgments, and had been richly blessed and led of the Lord </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord Jesus preached the truth when but a lad of tender years. In the temple he asked many questions of the &quot;wise men” of his day, “And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.” He not only was seeking after knowledge and understanding of his Father’s Word, but was also</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Plays Important Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To aid all the brethren in becoming more effective witnesses of the Kingdom, the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font1"> has been provided by the Lord as another weapon to use against the forces of ignorance. It is not for field distribution, but is a textbook for Kingdom publishers. All publishers should study it carefully, both privately and in the meetings. If an additional copy (or copies) is needed it should be ordered as a ‘Cash Item’, with remittance of 50c per copy accompanying order.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Re Cost of Cash Items</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">A number of companies and pioneers have written the Society, recently, concerning the cost of various cash items shown on their Invoices, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font1"> Bible, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> binder, rubber type set, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babyions,</span><span class="font1"> and others, the cost of which changes from time to time. When ordering, it should be kept in mind that many of such cash items are not produced in the Society’s factory but are obtained from commercial firms; hence the cost of these is always subject to change without notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">putting to good use what he had already learned. Jephthah’s daughter began her full-time service at Shiloh when but a young virgin. Timothy was but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a youth</span><span class="font1"> when given responsible oversight of the Lord’s goods. He had been raised up in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord”. The apostle Paul told him to press ahead, and to “let no man despise thy youth”. That he did, and, by the grace of the Lord God, performed faithfully his God-given assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, w’hen the need is more pressing than ever before, when “this gospel” shall be preached in all the world to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">meek</span><span class="font1"> of the earth, certainly no one can consider himself an exception to the rule that his obligation is in proportion to his opportunity. The call goes forth now for all the young brethren who have the opportunity to enter the ranks of vacation pioneers this summer and prepare the groundwork for a glorious life devoted to full-time service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Consider prayerfully and seriously your wonderful privilege of ‘honoring your Creator in the days of your youth’. Lay up a qualifying record that will assist toward your being called to Gilead for training and foreign service in the “nations afar off” in a few short years, if it be Jehovah's will. Your vacation pioneer application blank is waiting for you, as well as complete instructions on this feature of Kingdom work. Enroll in June, be in full swing in this work during July and August and finish in September when school begins. Do this and contribute toward a peak in hours during July and August. We are anticipating the greatest influx of young boys and girls into the ranks of the vacation pioneer service to date. We have made all preparations and are waiting to hear from you.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Public Meeting </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Kingdom Service Expanding</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Soon all the meek of the earth will pass through the perils of Armageddon and enter into the cleansed, refreshed new earth ready for unhindered Kingdom service throughout eternity. Before that glorious prospect is realized, however, Satan will employ every means of deception and opposition within his power against us with increasing pressure as his inescapable doom approaches. Parallel with his avalanche of demonic propaganda goes the invincible proclamation of the “Gospel of the Kingdom”. Those who are truly meek will not hesitate to separate themselves from the course of the demonized, doomed world and devote their time, energy and resources to advancing the Kingdom interests. Thus they heed the admonition of the apostle Paul to the Corinthians at 1 Corinthians 15:58, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font1"> “So, then, my beloved brethren, become ye steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord at all times.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Christian steadfastly and immovably seeks ways and means of enlarging his privileges in Kingdom service at the sacrifice of personal selfish interests. He carefully considers how he spends every moment of his time, every bit of energy, and how his mind is being occupied, and strives diligently to divert those resources now being used for other purposes to advancing the Kingdom service. During the month of July each one will have the opportunity of enlarging his privileges by engaging in evening witnessing, in addition to the usual time spent in the service. The offer in July will be a continuation of the June combination of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot; </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth', </span><span class="font1">on a 25c contribution. This booklet should be left in every home, where-ever possible. Make sure every person whose name is on the back-call file gets a copy immediately, then distribute them far and wide throughout your entire territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Public Meeting Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the gospel preaching steadily and surely expands toward the ends of the earth our privileges and opportunities in connection therewith must similarly be enlarged to keep pace with it. We believe that nearly every company has, by this time, had at least one series of public lectures. However, this is only the beginning. These public lectures will continue to be held on a greater scale in the future. All companies, as soon as one series of public lectures is ended, should be prepared to begin another series in a different section of territory. When all the territory has been covered with the series once, then it will be time to begin covering it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It appears that some of the publishers still fail to appreciate the great privileges they have of advertising these public lectures. The apostles, who accompanied Jesus in His public meeting campaign throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria always faithfully supported him in every way possible. They entered public squares and streets and made known the way of gaining life to all who desired to hear. They spread the good news far and wide and gained the attention of all who would listen and receive the invitation. The faithful publisher today will not try to do differently. He will willingly deprive himself of everything else in order to give full, 100-percent support to the presentday public meeting campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Handbills should be distributed on the streets, at back-calls, from</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Privileges</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>ity Enhanced</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">store to store and house to house, as explained in the May </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font1">The territory should De thoroughly covered with handbills, every person available doing the work and using every form of distribution possible. There are many other means of advertising as previously suggested that can and should be used in advertising these public lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only can the publishers enlarge their privileges in advertising the publie lectures during July, but the speakers also have a great responsibility in this regard. Every brother enrolled in the course in Theocratic ministry and qualified to deliver a public lecture should be given one of the hour talks to prepare. As soon as he gives evidence of being able to deliver it satisfactorily, he may be assigned to deliver it publicly. There are four essential features which every speaker should keep in mind to be successful in delivering an interesting public lecture. First, it requires a sincere </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">desire</span><span class="font1"> with a humble spirit and willingness to be used by the Lord in any way he may direct. Secondly, much </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">effort</span><span class="font1"> must be spent in studying the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font1"> and other instructions on delivering the Kingdom message effectively. Third, it requires </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font1"> to work out carefully every detail in the outline of the talk and make the finished speech coherent and easy to follow. Fourth, in order to be able to present the talk forcefully and effectively, the speaker must </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">practice</span><span class="font1"> it for delivery, using emphasis, gestures, expression, etc., doing tins several times before giving it publicly. No speaker should be assigned to give a public talk unless he will prepare properly in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If all speakers and publishers realize their privileges and earnestly seek to enlarge and expand them during July, that month is bound to be a month full of Kingdom activity, which will undoubtedly cause Satan and his crowd much discomfort, and at the same time bring rejoicing to the hearts of many sincere meek ones who will eventually inherit the earth.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tremendous enthusiasm with which the Lord's people received the recent public proclamation of the subject, “Tlie Meek Inherit the Earth,” testified as to its timeliness, need, and effectiveness. Now Hint the time is here for its distribution in booklet form, the brethren everywhere will delight to carry its consoling message to all the meek of the earth who are groaning under the lash of the oppressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As if to accentuate the forcefulness of the truths as therein contained, on tlie very same day that the message was released one of tlie world's leading proponents of violence, aggression, and evil doing was proclaimed by press dispatches as having been mobbed and killed, and trampled into the very mud and filth of a city square. To many, at least, it is very apparent that, ‘Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be.’ The paths that proud and evil men picture as leading to glory actually lead but to the grave. Now the Lord's people stand forth as the bearers of the only message that will show meek men the way to abundant life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Jehovah’s Side of the Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All men of good-will and meekness will naturally turn to the assuring and comforting truths contained in</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>“Theocratic Aid to I</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Disciplers Now Advance to More Intensive Training </span><span class="font1">“An efficient presentation of the Kingdom message is the need of the hour.” Why? Because the commission to teach or disciple all the nations devolves upon every one of Jehovah’s devoted servants. None can excuse himself, saying, ‘I am unable or exempt,’ because all necessary provision is being made by the great Teachers to thoroughly equip every commissioned one to faithfully obey and carry out its terms. This favored people, this elect race and their companions, are a people for a purpose—the discipling of all , the nations and the proclamation ■ of the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah's invisible power or holy spirit will guarantee the complete success of that purpose, and his people will not fail to perform their part therein; but the point each individual publisher must bear in mind is that every servant of Jehovah is affected. In order to faithfully measure up to the requirements of Jehovah’s determination or purpose to disciple all the nations, there is not one of God’s people that can do without the training now provided through the Theocratic ministry course, with its latest blessed instrument, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced Course In Training</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This new aid brings us from the first course, with all its manifest blessings, to the point where we may now enter into a more extensive training as teachers and ministers. From the time when the church in its infancy rejoiced and gave praise to Jehovah for the revelations wrought by the outpouring of the holy spirit, there certainly have been few greater causes for praise and gratitude on the part of God's people than the inception of the course in Theocratic ministry and all its attendant blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Contemplation of all that has developed as a result causes the heart to swell with emotion, and now Jehovah causes the cup of blessing to overflow in bringing forth that which will still further equip liis people for their teaching role. It is now plainly manifest that every servant of God vitally needs this complete training, because the issue of life or death revolves around the faithful execution of the terms of his commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid</span><span class="font1"> has that which will train and prepare God’s people for efficient action in every feature of Kingdom activity. Door-to-door work, with appropriate methods for handling ail obstacles and hindrances, is fully discussed. Ample training also for back-call and book-study work will be obtained by those who regularly study its weekly lessons. Magazine pubUshers will likewise become more proficient, and the public meeting activity can be entered into to the fullest extent by all those who make application of the knowledge and instructions set forth in this valuable new publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From every angle, therefore, God's people now stand in a most favored this new booklet, and, in combination with the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The King-'• dom Is at Hand&quot;,</span><span class="font1"> it presents a message of striking appeal to all who wish to live in a condition of peace and harmony with the great King Christ Jesus. It becomes more and more apparent that the nations are unable to convince men that they hold the remedy for earth's troubles, and, as Jehovah’s witnesses in this vital issue, all who now love Him will rejoice to hold forth his testimony, that the meek are the only ones who shall inherit the earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Publishers”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">position. Their scope of action broadens to lengths once undreamed of, and, in keeping therewith, Jehovah in his great goodness makes provision to thoroughly equip his servants to fulfill their assigned part in his announced purpose. In sheer gratitude, therefore, let every eligible brother not enrolled in the Theocratic ministry course now enroll. Attend all sessions regularly, and carefully prepare each lesson and whatever assignments are given to you, determined to improve your ability for greatest possible use.</span></p>

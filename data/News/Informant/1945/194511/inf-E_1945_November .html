<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOVEMBER, 1945 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">“Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.”—Matt. 28: 19, A.S.V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">BROOKLYN, N. Y.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>God s Spirit Directs</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Floods Earth with Truth</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">At no time in the sixty centuries past has the name of Jehovah, the Most High God, been magnified by widespread witness to the extent that it has since 1914. It has been during this history-making era that the life-giving waters of truth, starting out as a trickling stream, have broadened into a deep, swiftly moving body of water, branching out with irresistible force into every section of the earth. Yes, this surging river of truth has literally flooded this globe with vital information that has gladdened the hearts of all righteously disposed persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consider the evidence at hand in support of this. From the lips of thousands of truth-loving witnesses, within recent years, has the joyful message of Jehovah’s reign been sounded into the ears of countless multitudes. In just twenty-five years, more than 450,000,000 books and booklets, together with hundreds of millions of magazines and leaflets containing the Kingdom message, have been published, and public talks at world-wide assemblies, the radio, the phonograph, and practically every means of transmitting information at our disposal, have been utilized, to get done this all-important work. And all this accomplished, notwithstanding the ceaseless efforts of truth-hating religionists to dam up the river and stop the flow of vital waters to the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But how does all this relate to the theme for November, as expressed in the title of this article? In answer, we ask, Does it seem at all possible that this small band of Jehovah’s witnesses, frail and weak in themselves, hated and despised and violently opposed by all nations of this world, could accomplish such miraculous feat in their own strength and might? No! “Not by [human] might, nor by power, but by my spjbit, saith Jehovah of hosts,” has this been achieved. (Zech. 4:6, A.S.V.) Solely by the operation of Jehovah’s invincible active force, resting in a powerful way upon his Kingdom publishers, be they of the anointed or the “other sheep” class, has it been at all possible to realize this superhuman task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching Work Expands Through Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That spirit of God, through the illumination of His Word, now points to the expansion of the Kingdom proclamation on an unprecedented scale as the postwar period opens up. Unquestionably, the public meeting activity, inaugurated by the leading of the holy spirit in January, 1945, will play a prominent part in the further magnification of Jehovah’s name, in the preaching-period yet ahead, before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During November every Kingdom publisher, whether he be a pioneer, special pioneer, or company publisher, should take it upon himself to participate in some way in public</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Force upon Kingdom</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>November Activity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">meeting work. Do not resist the leading of the spirit by thinking that the work is not for you, because of your feeling unqualified, due to age, or inability, or some other “reason”. This is Jehovah's work. He has ordained it, and he will, through his spirit resting on his servants, see that it is done. His active force motivating Kingdom publishers does not mean, however, that the spirit of God will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">compel</span><span class="font2"> us to engage in handbill distribution, or go from house to house, or make a back-call. The publisher must take the first step, must put forth the initiative, to demonstrate his willingness to serve the Lord. Then, after exerting such effort, in accordance with God’s Word and organization Instructions, the servant of the Lord may rest assured that the spirit of God will guide and direct him in a way ever pleasing to his heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Servants in companies, therefore, j will be on the alert in November to I secure every type of hall possible to expand the public meeting work into | all parts of their respective territo-1 ries. L’se the Kingdom Hall, schoolhouses, abandoned churches, fraternal halls, municipal buildings, or any other structure available, to run series of talks throughout the fall season. Be sure, also, when ordering handbills, that your order reaches this office at least </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> month ahead of the date scheduled for delivery of the talks. The speaker selected will prepare well his material, never seeking to draw attention to himself, but always directing attention to the message presented. Company publishers and pioneers should co-operate in saturating the territory with handbills. Let the whole community know that Jehovah’s witnesses are in town, and putting on a series of absorbing Bible talks. All publishers will continue to present the previous month's offer of any two books and two booklets, on a contribution of 50c, as they make thorough coverage of the territory their goal, being careful not to pass by a single dwelling without attempting to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Instruct Your Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regular publishers and servants should not be content with getting in their own time, but should offer instruction to the weaker publishers and newly interested ones. Take them along with you on the streets or from house to house and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font2"> them bow to do the work. Remember that the apostle Paul said, “I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shewed </span><span class="font2">you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house.” The worldly ‘Thanksgiving holiday’ during this month will permit many publishers to spend one or two full days in the service, instructing others as well as preaching themselves. Group witnessing might well be scheduled for these days, following the method outlined in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Publishers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In your public meeting witnessing, bear in mind that getting a person of good-will to attend a public talk is not the sum total of your work in connection with such one. This individual does not yet possess knowledge, the gaining of which constitutes the first step in becoming a servant of the Most High, and ultimately attaining life. This “stranger” must be discipled, or taught; and since discipling others is our commission, the obligation to teach him is laid upon us. Discipling takes time. It can’t be done overnight, or through a public meeting alone. It can be done, however, through regular back-calls and book studies. Do not allow any interest that develops through the medium of public meetings to grow cold. Follow it up immediately, using your evenings, and especially the back-call night, for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah's active force is upon his Kingdom publishers. It will accomplish the work that He has purposed, the ‘preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness’. Rely upon that spirit to back you up, to help you in every time of need, and go forward with zeal and determination to do your part in making known during November Jehovah’s name and purpose.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Cash Item” Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beginning on November 1, when orders for “cash items” only, such as yearbooks, calendars, handbills, magazine bags, company forms, etc., are listed on your order blank, a “Duplicate Label Copy of Your Cash Item Order” will be enclosed in the package or carton in which the supplies are shipped. This duplicate label is to be retained by you for your own company or pioneer records. All bookkeeping adjustments pertaining to this order are to be made from this label. No other receipt or invoice for that particular shipment will be sent to you, and a record of the charge for it will not appear on your monthly statement. However, when both &quot;campaign literature” and “cash items” are listed on one order blank, the entire order will be invoiced as heretofore, and it will appear on your monthly statement. Please remember that a remittance to cover should accompany every “cash item” order. Every order, whether for “cash items” or campaign literature, or both, or even for one item of either, should be listed and sent in on the regular order blank.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Success</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Follows Sincere Effort</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">There has been a slight downward trend in the back-call book studies conducted by the companies, special pioneers and general pioneers during recent months, instead of the increase one would naturally expect at this time. Book studies should be on the increase, and gaining with each passing month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the most gigantic tasks facing the Lord’s people at the present time is that of breaking through the mind-stupefying blindness cast over the people by Satan the Devil. It is beyond the power of any human creature or man-made organization to accomplish that task. Therefore it is not to be approached in our own strength. But Jehovah, through his King Christ Jesus, can and will do this job well, using His irresistible power. This irresistible power operates upon and through his faithful people.-—Isaiah 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we, as servants of the Lord, permit the spirit and Word of Jehovah to direct us, we can accomplish this stupendous task. Simply leaving a few books with the people will not accomplish it. We must call back upon the people. We must wrestle with this problem and fight this blinding influence by showing the people how desirable it is to have the mind of the Lord at the present time. Show them how this can be found wflth the aid of the Bible and the literature you leave with them. Suggest your returning at some future date to discuss it with them and assist them in obtaining this very vital information. Remember the Lord's assurance that his ‘sheep will hear his voice, and another will they not follow’. Therefore, if we adhere very closely to the Word of the Lord, his truth, and present it in the spirit of the Lord, it will reach the ears of the “other sheep”, and they will respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus is also author of the statement. “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” That is what the servant of the Lord depends upon, to penetrate the cloud of darkness and enlighten the people—the spirit of the Lord and his truth. Every placement should be followed up diligently and faithfully. Try making back-calls on the people and endeavor to start studies with them. We cannot accept the peoples’ lack of interest or refusal to invite us back at the beginning as conclusive evidence that they lack interest in the Lord’s kingdom. The Devil has done such a thorough job of blinding their minds that they do not realize their undone condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us, with patience and perseverance, press on in the work, using the various provisions with which the Lord has provided us through the Theocratic ministry’, by the literature that we have in our hands, and his spirit enlightening us, and go forward in the work of enlightening the nations in the strength and spirit of Jehovah. Make back-calls, and conduct back-call book studies on all placements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Treasure of Service” Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">100% Participation in Ministry During December</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Zealous Activity to Mark Appreciation of Glorious Treasure</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Our guiding text for December certainly portrays the ministry as being of such unusual value and worth that every commissioned servant of God, out of sheer appreciation of the favor thus bestowed, will gladly give his all in Kingdom service. When the apostle Paul spoke of having this treasure in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7), full recognition was made of our insufficiency, but the heart-cheering remedy is referred to in his further words that “the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us”. Instead of permitting enemy forces to overwhelm his frail servants, or allowing any condition or obstacle to interfere with their ministry, Jehovah supports them, thus magnifying his power amid human weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Naturally, then, every servant of God is included as possessing the glorious treasure of service. The commission to preach applies to all Involved. There is none too weak, too incapable, too insufficient to serve. The glorious treasure of ministry or service, as well as the allsufficient backing, is extended to each and every servant by the excellency of Jehovah’s almighty power. Who, therefore, can be inactive during December? Every faithful servant is determined that as far as he is concerned there will be no inactive publisher in the “Treasure of Service” Testimony Period. One hundred-percent participation in the ministry is our goal for the month of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Offer for Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Amid the signs that clearly mark the fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning the destruction of the rule by Satan and the incoming reign of earth’s Bightful Ruler, we shall have the joy of offering </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples”,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 2.5c. With people that already have this combination, any other books or booklets may be suggested as especially needful for their advancement in coming to a knowledge of the truth. The fact that they have the offer marks them as book-study prospects, and alert publishers will be ever ready to render further aid to these good-will people by arranging for a book study in order to properly feed these “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Servants of companies and regular publishers, lend a hand during December to aid the less experienced brethren. Veteran publishers may be very efficient in presenting the message of truth, and a wonderful opportunity opens up for them to train the less experienced or newer publishers so that both may make full use of the ministry to maintain the “stranger’s” right of free worship of God. By such co-operation many of the different obstacles which often prevent Kingdom activity are removed and wonderful results attained. Surely by a determined effort in this direction arrangements for service could be taken advantage of by everyone in the company, and during December the excellency of Jehovah’s power reflected to such an extent that there will not be a single inactive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Avenue of Service Wide Open</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Word still comes of companies easing up on public meeting activity or not putting on public lectures because of “inability”. Brethren, by all means put forth the effort I Study and equip yourselves through the Theocratic ministry school; become able ministers; do the best you can under the existing circumstances, and you will improve with practice. The main thing is to get started. Don’t be discouraged if results are not always up to expectations. Do your part faithfully and the Lord will bless the effort to his praise. Likewise all company publishers, regardless of who is assigned to give the lecture, support the effort for the work’s sake. Enthusiastically look after every detail, so that the entire attempt will be a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The street work is an important part of public meeting activity too, and even in cold weather, by moving around from store to store and talking to people on the street, publishers can keep warm enough to carry on this feature. The distribution of the special issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> will have quickened Interest in the magazine, and both it and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should constantly be kept before the people’s notice so that they may read them for enlightenment and Instruction in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back-call and book-study activity are also particularly appropriate at this time of the year, when the majority of the people are kept at home by the wintry weather. Here is where the Theocratic ministry training of all publishers will show fruitage. Certainly all attending the ministry course have been fully equipped and qualified by now to conduct a book study. Use this training to first convince the people of their absolute need to study God’s Word, and then, as an able minister, proceed with the book study. With tact, any back-call where good-will interest exists can be developed into a book study merely by commencing to ask the questions from the question booklet, and having the interested person express an answer. Sum up by reading the paragraph from the book and the cited scriptures. Follow the lesson up each week, and you have a book study going. As interest grows bring the good-w’ill person to the company meeting, and in due time you will be able to work together in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The glorious treasure of service, then, is for the possession of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font2">servant of the Most High. It has not been committed to angels or those seemingly most equipped from natural angles. We have it in frail earthen vessels, our frailty being overcome by the excellency of Jehovah’s power. December will be a very active month for all who really appreciate this unspeakable favor and treasure of service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In the October </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> we outlined the service meetings for that month, and many companies have profited greatly from this outline by having more interesting and instructive service meetings. It is not the purpose of the Society to outline the service meetings every month; nevertheless, you can all benefit from this same outline by readjusting these items to make up your service meeting programs in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This outline gives you some idea of the great variety of ways that material can be presented in service meetings to avoid lifeless, dull and monotonous meetings. The servants should arrange the service meetings so that the weakest features in the company’s activity will receive the most attention. Using a different arrangement for each meeting and</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Year-round Pioneer Activity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Requires Keen Appreciation and Good Management</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Each year, as winter approaches, a number of pioneers go off the list. While some doubtless do so because of circumstances over which they have no control, others seemingly conclude that they cannot continue pioneering because of the cold. Is this viewpoint correct? What about the postman, the milkman, the traffic cop, to mention just a few? Do they drop their vocations when winter comes along and then take them up again in the spring? Of course not! Communications, food, safety and protection are essential factors that require attention the year round. Is the keeping of Theocratic communications open, the supplying of spiritual food, and the providing of lasting safety and protection less vital and important?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do we appreciate the urgency of our work in casting up “defense through knowledge”? Do we appreciate the great honor of being ambassadors for The Theocracy? Do we appreciate the glorious treasure of service? If so, then we will not slack our hand when cold weather with its hardships comes along. Rather, we will view these obstacles as an added challenge to our love for Jehovah and our appreciation of the privilege of full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Wise Management</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are confident that with the great majority of those pioneers who go off the list as winter approaches the fault lies not so much in a failure to appreciate their privileges as in a failure to use wisdom in managing their affairs. If we would continue in the pioneer work throughout the year, we must learn to become efficient managers. Not only must we possess the proper spiritual qualifications of a knowledge of the truth, love for Jehovah, appreciation of service, possession of Jehovah’s active force, etc., but certain material assets are required, such as time, energy, and means. Physical strength is needed, hour requirements. must be met, there are expenses of a monetary nature, and winter makes added drains on all of these. To neatly balance them so as to keep in the full-time service requires wisdom from above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Plan your time, always making provision for the unexpected by getting in as much time as possible early in the month. Eliminate all time-wasting habits and let your hours be Theocratically fruitful. Make a budget of your time and then stick to it. When making back-calls in a neighborhood, be prepared to make call-backs on not-at-homes, etc., so as not to waste an evening just because one or two parties are not at home. Avoid needless travel from one end of the territory to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">another.</span><span class="font2">_____________________________</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">considering other Theocratic material in addition to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">will stimulate attendance at your meetings and enable the publishers to gain more Theocratic instruction for their ‘singing the New Song’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Service meetings should never be arranged for the purpose of entertaining; the sole objective should be to convey Theocratic instruction to the hearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regardless, though, of how good a service meeting may be, it does not accomplish its full purpose if the publishers are not there to receive its benefits. Therefore every Kingdom publisher should regularly attend service meetings and listen carefully to every discussion and participate to the fullest extent in the meetings with the sole desire of putting those suggestions into practice in daily field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To keep meeting the quotas also requires physical strength, vitality. Learn to conserve your energy and to expend it judiciously. Lack of control of spirit, rushing about hastily, always tense, will, more than anything else, bring you to a low ebb. Learn to relax, and you will build up where before you were tearing down. Poise, and an abiding confidence in Jehovah, will do much toward keeping you strong physically as well as spiritually. Proper eating habits, plain but nourishing food, taken in moderation, are also important, and especially so in cold weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Staying in the pioneer work yearround further means that you will have to watch your expenses. It means using your funds for only such things as are necessary and using wisdom so as to get the most for your money. And that means you may miss some of the luxuries that you were used to. But is freedom from Satan’s organization not worth it? Why pine for the “flesh pots of Egypt”? Your “manna” is sure.</span></p>

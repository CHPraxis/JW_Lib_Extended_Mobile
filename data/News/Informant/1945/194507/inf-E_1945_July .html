<p><span class="font2">The apostle Paul was a great enthusiast for enlarging his own and all of his brethren’s privileges of service. After enumerating the proper steps to be taken and showing how he himself and his associates were enlarged toward the Corinthian brethren, he then exhorted them to be similarly enlarged. (2 Cor. 6) In this the apostle was outlining for our education the proper procedure to follow today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah is gathering his people from the north, from the south, from the east, and from the west. In this work he is using his holy spirit, his truth, and his consecrated people operating under the direction of his anointed King. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> articles describing Brother Knorr’s trip to South America give us a vivid description of how the spirit and the word of the Lord have been working to assemble isolated people in many countries and gather them into Jehovah’s organization, even though no detailed organization arrangement existed for that purpose in those countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Ye Enlarged</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to this, however, it pleases the Lord to have his consecrated people enlarged to embrace the additional privilege of assisting in the education of these people in the Kingdom requirements. To this end he has invited hundreds of consecrated men and women, ministers all, to Gilead to further equip themselves, or be enlarged. To enjoy this privilege these brethren had to apply themselves diligently to their studies from early morning until late into the night, day after day, until they were properly trained. Those who faithfully applied themselves have been sent forth or are now being sent forth to some fifteen different countries, and new fields for still others to go to opening up every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before being elected to this service these brethren had to manifest faith in the Lord. They had to make a full, unconditional consecration to him and then enter actively into his service and continue walking in the light. In due time they became pioneers, then special pioneers, and were ultimately invited to Gilead, and then on to these new fields. In their case that was the simple, orderly process of enlarging their privileges. The same principle applies to everyone who is going to have further and greater privileges in the Lord’s service. They must follow the leading of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Front Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Foreign fields are not the only places where there is a crying need for service organization. Right here at home there are innumerable cities, towns, and communities where the good-will interest is not receiving proper attention. There is room for thousands more pioneers and for more specially trained competent brethren to act as special pioneers. There is a need for brethren to accept the responsibility of servants in companies, to conduct </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and book studies, put on public meetings, and generally carry out the duties of an able minister of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are all Theocratic positions bestowed upon faithful servants of the Lord by the present King, who is supervising and directing his work; privileges far greater than any earthly potentate can bestow upon his subjects. These positions are available to consecrated brethren who are sufficiently desirous of enlarging their Kingdom privileges and equipping themselves for that purpose. Do you want a greater share in New World service? If you do, enlarge your privileges now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How Can We Enlarge Our Privileges?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By following the course blazed by Jesus and taken by those servants now being used of the Lord. First, by devoting yourself wholly to the Lord and availing yourself of all the provisions that the Lord lias made for his servants at the present time, then by studying and diligently engaging in the Kingdom service regularly, by enrolling in the Theocratic school, by preparing and delivering talks with great care, paying attention to the counsel and strengthening the weak points of your presentation, by engaging in all branches of the public meeting campaign, by making back-calls and conducting studies with the same diligence and earnestness that those brethren who attend Gilead and then graduate display. Then continue to walk in the light. If possible, devote yourself to full-time pioneer service, faithfully carrying out the requirements for that branch of the service. If you are unable to be a pioneer now, be a good company publisher, putting in 60 or more hours each month. In this way only can you enlarge your privileges of service and faithfully manifest to Jehovah and his King your earnest zeal for the Kingdom. You will be obtaining for yourself their favorable consideration and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Co-operate diligently with the local organization in expanding the witness work during the summer months by putting on talks in the open spaces, as well as in the various halls. There are thousands of parks, recreation centers, vacant lots, and home lawns where people can be invited and assembled to listen to a public talk. See that they are given the opportunity. Be Theocratic in all your ways. Keep your handbills neat. If you must use blank forms for local printing, see that the job is neatly done. See that the hall, or wherever the meeting is held, is clean and attractive. See that the good-will interest receives proper attention. Let the month of July mark a decisive step forward</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>All Publishers Blessed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Kingdom publishers everywhere were thrilled with the release of the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font2"> The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> booklet served its purpose and has now been replaced by this new publication, which is the first 884-page bound book ever to be printed exclusively for the aid of Kingdom publishers. It represents a mighty step forward in the great work of proclaiming “this gospel of the kingdom”, and the results of its application are bound to be felt and noticed by ’most all of earth’s inhabitants. All Theocratic servants rejoice over this new provision, and will want to sow bountifully to reap its manifold blessings. No one can afford to deprive himself of the aid and instruction this course has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This book will be one of the most highly treasured possessions of the Kingdom publisher. All should study it regularly at home, as well as at the meetings. After carefully studying it, you will then apply that knowledge in your daily activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use in Service Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of this book should not be limited to the Theocratic Ministry studies. The company servant should arrange to have demonstrations in the service meetings showing how to put into practice the many helpful suggestions offered in the book; such as how a good effective delivery with oral emphasis, gestures, good choice of words, etc., aids in placing magazines, books, booklets. Demonstrate the use of coherence and show how good argumentation should be used. Every publisher should use tact in presenting “this gospel of the kingdom”, and Lesson 50 gives several effective means of using tact to overcome barriers with which the publisher is confronted daily in door-to-door witnessing. Good, lively, interesting demonstrations on these various approaches and arguments would be very instructive to the brethren, and also help to liven up the service meeting. There are in this book many other features that can and should be illustrated and shown to be of practical value to all in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in your life for enlarging your Kingdom privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Give diligence to your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study. This meeting should always be held in the local Kingdom Hall or company headquarters, and not at some temporary hall where you are putting on public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer during the month of July will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. Leave the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Meek Inherit the Earth’</span><span class="font2"> in every possible home, on a contribution if they can afford to contribute; but if not, leave it with them free, provided they agree to read it. “So then my beloved brethren, become ye steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord at all times.” —1 Cor. 15: 58, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth. </span><span class="font2">company, in addition to its use in the Theocratic ministry school. Even brethren who have other assignments for service meetings can oftentimes find in this book valuable material that will aid them to give better and more Interesting presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Speakers Greatly Benefited</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every brother who qualifies and is able should be enrolled in the Theocratic ministry school. The training acquired now through this course will be very necessary in the daily ministry of the truth to others up until Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The student speakers have an added privilege of training themselves to deliver public talks. For that reason they should carefully study every lesson in the book and put the instruction into practice in their student talks and service meeting assignments, in addition to their regular witnessing work. As much care and attention and enthusiasm should be given to the preparation of your six-minute talks as is required for an hour lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If all of the brethren in the company participate in this course to the very best of their ability, the results are bound to reflect on the company’s monthly field activity. The faithful application of the instruction received from this course of study will affect all features of field-service activity, particularly the house-to-house work, back-calls, studies, and the public meetings. What a joy it is to ‘teach them to obey the same commands that we ourselves obey’!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Well Done, Faithful Servants!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PEAK!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">207,800 Total New Subscriptions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The greatest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign to date has ended. Yes, brethren, the final total of new subscriptions obtained during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign from January through April is 207,800, the highest number of subscriptions ever received in this office in that length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Well done, thou good and faithful servant,” are Jehovah’s words of approval addressed to those publishers who have ‘invested their talents’ wisely. He has richly blessed our efforts during this campaign. This glad news brings great joy to the heart of every Kingdom publisher and every person of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is very encouraging and a great stimulus to all to go forth now and care for the interest that has been found, making the back-calls, starting studies, bringing them to the public meetings and company studies. Let’s not forget about these new subscribers now, brethren. Keep calling on them and stimulating their interest in the Kingdom so that they may be among the ‘meek who inherit the earth’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>“Stranger’s Right” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Stranger’s” Right of F Be Upheld D</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Extend Hearty Welcome to Men of Good-Will</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The old world, while glibly promising a more abundant life with contentment and security for all, continues its mad downward course of estrangement from God, and the gulf between it and the New World becomes ever wider. Under its oppressive rule the burdens of the poor and needy become unbearable. Their right to freely worship Jehovah and walk in the right way is scornfully denied them. Groaning under the lash of wicked and violent taskmasters, their cry for relief goes up to the Lord of sabaoth. He has heard their appeal, and declares that He will take swift action in their behalf; and Jehovah now calls upon His free nation to ‘cast up the highway to life, and gather out all the stones’, so that the meek of the earth may walk thereon. His faithful witnesses will not turn the “stranger” from his right. Throughout all of August, the “Stranger’s Hight” Testimony Period, they will energetically minister to the needs of those seeking the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bountiful Equipment and Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To inspire and stimulate to increased activity during August, the Lord has provided us with another new booklet for distribution. Right in line with maintaining and granting the “stranger” his right, this booklet identifies the One who will really uphold and bless the people of good-will. It glows with hope and promise, and is entitled “The ‘Commander to the Peoples’ ”. Tn combination with the latest book, “T7ic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, lx at Hand&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> it will be joyfully carried to the people, and both will be placed on a contribution of 25c. Instead of permitting the oppressed “strangers” to continue putting their hope and trust in the vain and impotent world leaders, Jehovah’s servants will be striving to put in sixty full hours of field service in August, directing the people to the great Commander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Who can feel that the “stranger's” right is being maintained when weeks or months are allowed to slip past without sharing in this joyful service? Certainly the term “irregular publisher” has no place in the scope of action of one fully devoted to Jehovah. What joy ami increase would follow the determination of every associated publisher to regularly uphold the right of the “stranger” every month ! Beginning with August this could be carried out as follows: When advertising the public meetings by engaging in handbill distribution, ami door-to-door presentation of the Kingdom message, the publisher seeks out those of good-will, and thus makes known to such the first steps to take toward free worship. He then assures the newly interested one that a cordial welcome awaits him at the Kingdom Hall, and personally brings him to the public lecture, putting him at ease, gladly helping him to understand puzzling questions, and making him acquainted with the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The goal to strive for here is for every publisher to bring at least one interested person, in addition to those drawn by the general advertising, which w’ould mean that thousands more would be assembled for instruction in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Further Steps</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then make provisions for a book study in the homes of the “stran-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ee Worship Will Gladly tiring August</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">gers” and show them that their right goes beyond a mere fundamental knowledge, and includes all the privileges and blessings of Jehovah’s favored people. Most companies have not yet reached the quota of one study per publisher; so if this goal is striven for during August and accomplished, it will represent another increase or expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Going farther now, the right of the “stranger” includes the joy of association and companionship with Jehovah’s servants in witnessing to His supremacy, which means that the true witness has the great privilege of instructing the “strangers” on how to take up and carry on all features of Kingdom service. Here again, by every publisher’s taking at least one “stranger&quot; w’ith him for instruction and aid in field service, there will be still another increase to Jehovah's praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From all these angles, therefore, the “Stranger’s Right” Testimony Period presents unlimited opportunities for Kingdom activity. Every day of August can be used in assisting the “stranger” and maintaining his right of worship in one feature of service or another. There is every reason to believe that increased and ever-expanding efforts to assemble and help the “stranger” will be put forth by the Free Nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Zealous Service Follows Appreciation of Gracious Provisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The new booklet will not be consigned, but the companies everywhere should order their supply. Jehovah bountifully supplies his people with opportunities of service, and his full hand provides abundance of truth with which to satisfy the desire of the needy. Every indication at this time is toward the assembling of more and more people of good-will, and their association with the Free Nation in the true worship and service of the Lord. These good-will people have been kept in a condition of oppression and darkness until now, but our service text for August shows Jehovah's attitude toward those who ‘turn the stranger from his right’. —Mal. 3; 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Determined not to be of that class found depriving the “stranger” of his right, not only will the faithful servant see that he has a share in Kingdom service himself, but during August he will set himself the following goal: Personally bring one person of good-will to the public lectures; establish at least one back-call book study; and assist one new associate in becoming a regular and efficient publisher. What an increase would follow the attainment of such an objective!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>United States Postal Notes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Many brethren find that the present fee for postal money orders is too high ; so they send cash and currency through the mail. In many cases this is lost and cannot be replaced or traced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United States Post Office Department has recently inaugurated a new service for those wishing a simple and less expensive way to send money through the mails. Post offices now issue United States postal notes, which can be purchased for any amount from one cent to ten dollars. The fee is only five cents for any amount between these figures, and they are just as safe to send in mail as are the regular</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>To the</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Full-Time Privileges and Obligations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Those who have the opportunity to be full-time servants of the Lord, see that opportunity, and then take advantage of it, certainly are the most favored of all creatures on earth at the present time. And with the end of this old world all who live will be likewise favored, for only those devoted to the Lord and His kingdom will survive Armageddon. Those who could be in the full-time service now and are not simply “don't know what they are missing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the young folks who signed up as vacation pioneers after the St. Louis convention, in 1941, are now serving as general pioneers, special pioneers, and some even in foreign lands. This certainly shows the importance of getting a proper start. That means you will arrange your affairs so as to take in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font2">features of the service, not choosing one or another because it may seem to be the easiest. By signing up as vacation pioneers you have entered into an agreement with the Lord. You have made, as it were, a vow unto him, and now it is up to you to keep that vow. The next two months should see all of you reaching your peak in hours. How can you do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A keen appreciation of your privileges and proper planning will greatly aid you in this regard. By diligent study of the Lord’s Word and faithful attendance at the study meetings, the great honor of being a witness for Jehovah and an ambassador for His kingdom will be indelibly impressed upon your mind. Also fixed in mind will be the need of the men of good-will, who are like hungry lost sheep, whom it is your privilege to find and to feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Appreciation of these things will arouse in you a desire to do all you can in the Lord's service; but to carry out that desire requires more. It requires planning. Therefore, budget your time, plan your affairs with just one thought in mind: “How will it affect my pioneer time?” Then stick to your schedule. Proper planning and a keen appreciation will enable you to reach your peak of hours during July and August, and to do so with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Year-round Full-Time Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Whosoever hath [Kingdom interests well cared fori, to him shall be given [more Kingdom privileges and much joy].” Having made good use of your privileges of service as a company publisher, the Lord blessed you with the vision and appreciation of full-time service. And now, as you continue to measure up to its requirements, the Lord is enlarging your privileges. More and more, pioneers, both special and general, are becoming the backbone of company organizations, serving as company, assistant company, back-call, advertising, etc., servants, and conducting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies and the Theocratic ministry schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">postal money orders. These are more convenient to purchase, as no written application is required; and they are cheaper when sending small amounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When these United States postal notes are sent to the Society for subscriptions or supplies, care should be taken when filling out the front and the back. The name and address of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., should be written on the front, and the name and address of the sender should be written on the back, in the blank spaces provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More and more the truth is being impressed upon you that no man is to live unto himself; that each one should seek the welfare of his brother as well as his own. Is such giving of aid limited to those brothers having special qualifications? Far from it! </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font2"> pioneers, brothers and sisters, old and young, well-educated or possessing only a limited education, have a responsibility in this regard. And what is that? Endeavoring to build up the company organization by feeding the “other sheep” and then “following through”. Remember, your obligation toward them does not stop by merely holding a book study with them. As they make progress you will show’ them the need of assembling with others at the company meetings, and make arrangements to call for them, and, if possible, provide transportation for them. Invite them to come along with you when making back-ealls on others, and then tactfully show’ them their privilege to have a share in the Kingdom announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Your Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, you pioneers have a great responsibility in connection with the company studies. By virtue of being in the full-time service, having the Kingdom truths on your minds and lips morning, noon and night, you are bound </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> have a clearer vision, a better understanding of them. It is your duty, therefore, to help others to get the benefit of this increased appreciation, and while you should not monopolize the study, you should always be ready to do your part by furnishing adequate comments. By thus doing your part not only will you aid your brethren to become stronger in faith, but you will be blessed yourself. In fact, you will receive an even greater blessing; for is it not written, “It is mere blessed to give than to receive”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To properly discharge these obligations you will need an abundant measure of the holy spirit, Jehovah's activating force. Not in our own might or power can w’e do this, nor shall we succeed if moved by merely human motives. We must have the mind of Christ, be spiritually minded, ever keeping in mind the all-important thing, namely, the vindication of Jehovah's name. We must continually draw upon his spirit as our source of power. This we do through prayer, through study of his Word and by walking humbly before him, in meekness accepting whatever he permits, confident that all will work together for good because we love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I’ioneers—vacation pioneers and year-round full-time servants of Jehovah—most favored is your position ! Many are your privileges! Make good use of them!</span></p>

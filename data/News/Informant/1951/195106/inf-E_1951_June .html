<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we reported only 63,423 publishers in the United States.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Of the many thousands of languages spoken today, there is but one pure language and that is the pure language of truth, God’s Word. The Almighty God has provided it for peoples of all lands and tongues. So, during the month of June, Jehovah’s servants earth-wide will be aiding persons of many nationalities to know and speak that pure language.—Zeph. 3: 9.</span></p>

We will thus be fired with enthusiasm to speak it forth to others. Having our commission uppermost in mind, our desire will be to use our enthusiasm in aiding others to learn and appreciate this knowledge that means life to them. To assist us in fulfilling this commission the same literature offer we have made. Help these new publishers to become regular and effective ministers. Keep on telling the good news. Reflect Jehovah's glory as you go from house to house, make back-culls, conduct home Bible studies, and train those of good will to become disciples. Doing this will have a wholesome effect on everyone, more territory will be worked, more people of good will educated in the truth, a greater witness given, and we will continue to receive Jehovah's blessing. &quot;Consequently, my beloved brothers, become stead-as for May will he used, namely the timely book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life'’.</span><span class="font2"> It will be placed with a self-covered booklet, on a 35c contribution.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Book placements (as well as the many subscriptions obtained earlier this year) will create openings for starting home Bible studies. Goodwill persons want to enjoy the happy sound of the pure language and learn how to speak it; it is through the back-call and Bible-study work that they can do so. Hence, call back on your placements, feed those showing interest, take an interest in them and spend time In helping them. Start them off aright by showing them how to get the most from, and make the best use of, their literature. And remember, advance preparation is vital to lively and profitable studies.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">The Society is herewith issuing a new and simplified system for keeping the accounts of all-size companies. Enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">are two copies of the new Company Accounts Instruction sheet (SC-70), one copy for the accounts servant and the other to be read by the stock and advertising servants and kept on file by the company servant. Samples of the new Accounts Sheet (SC-8) and Progressive Inventory (SC-17) are also enclosed. Discard the old forms these replace, but continue to use your present supply of all other related forms until they are exhausted. The name of the Credit Memo (SC-7) has been changed to Receipt, but no change is made in its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When filling out the Remittance Form (S-52), disregard the division of money between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> as money for these magazines will no longer be separated ; but continue to show’ the total for the magazine account separate from the total for subscriptions. Money remitted for cash items will be separated from money for campaign literature on the Remittance Form, but the stock and accounts servants will make this separation of money only once each month, when the Progressive Inventory is posted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the future, the Society will show charges for cash items separate from charges for campaign literature on both invoices and monthly statements. Similarly, remittances for cash items will be listed sepa-</span></p>

Hence, companies should continue to arrange for and utilize these meetings to the best advantage. If possible, make use of every week end by keeping a continuous series going. People generally like to spend their week ends doing or enjoying something different. So why not have them hear the pure word of truth in any one of the special places you may select to have the public meetings'.' Invite them and then take them along with you. Warmer weather means additional opportunities to speak the pure language in this manner throughout the territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Rural witnessing can be planned for certain localities, and in conjunction with this rural activity public meetings can be arranged. Territories can be effectively covered by an orderly and systematic arrangement. Company and territory servants, give some thought to this and plan the most effective way to reach the people in your territory. Take in all the smaller towns and villages, present the offer and advertise the lecture to be given in some nearby commtmity house, lodge hall, outside location, etc. Planning in advance will reduce travel to a minimum, and needless expenditure of time, energy and resources will be eliminated. A full day of service in rural work will open the way for many to hear the pure language and obtain pure-language publications. Since rural activity is limited in many places, a real effort should be put forth to cover such territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Aim</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Our efforts for increase are not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to gather</span><span class="font2"> together a large organization of which we can boast or be proud. No, not that! Our goal is not to convert the old world. Our efforts for increase are for the purpose of accomplishing the greatest work on earth. We want to see clod’s word of truth spread among all people, earthwide, so that the worship and praise of Jehovah may be expanded and the crowd of pure-language speakers may increase. The harvest is truly great, but the workers are comparatively few. So, as the Lord blesses us with an increase in workers, we strive to maintain such gains and together work to produce much, some thirty, some sixty, and others a hundredfold. Thus we diligently spread the pure language in every way to reach increasing numbers of men of good will, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">As international crises Hare and fade anil public opinion blazes and subsides, Jehovah's witnesses meet with many false ideas concerning themselves. Common among such are, &quot;You are a communist&quot;; and “You won’t tight!&quot; We want to tactfully answer these objections and then direct the minds of the people to the Kingdom. For instance, one might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Communism is against God and freedom of religion, and it seeks to revolutionize the world by force. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses believe strongly in the Almighty God, have fought many legal battles for freedom of religion, preach against revolts, and exhort the people to turn to the kingdom of God, waiting on him for the destruction of wickedness. We are violently persecuted in Russia and her satellite countries, and all because we tell the people that Almighty God himself will soon destroy all godlessness and wickedness and will set up a new world where there will be no sickness, sorrow, pain, want, fear, old age, or even death. Our fervent desire is to aid all persons of good will to find the way to everlasting life in that world. That is why I am calling today with this publication . . .’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Answering the charge, &quot;you won't tight.” one can tactfully reply: “You wouldn’t expect your minister to fight, would you? Well, I too am a minister. Jehovah’s witnesses are a society of ministers. As ministers, we are exempted from military service not only by the Scriptures but also by the law of the land. We are in a covenant with the Almighty God, Jehovah, to make known the good news of his kingdom under the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ. How could we participate in war and at the same time represent the Prince of Peace? How could we fulfill our covenant to preach God's kingdom? We are under a sacred vow to make known the good news that Jehovah through Christ is about to sweep away this system of things and set up a system where there will be no more wars and no one will have to sacrifice his loved ones to warfare. At that time love will prevail, and all humankind will live in peace forever; yes, they will have everlasting life. It is our job to help persons learn how to gain that everlasting life. Ours is an educational work for real life; we tire ambassadors of peace, and that is why I am calling at your door this morning. . . .”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Studying the “New World Translation” has infused new life into the theocratic ministry school. Publishers enjoying its benefits are learning the “pure language” of Bible truth, “with a view to all the riches of the full assurance of their understanding.” (Col. 2: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> NW) However, to further assist the students in preparing their discourses, the following demonstration, planned for twenty-five minutes, will illustrate how to prepare the analytical talks and chain word discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 1: The student is at home preparing his assignment, which is a portion of the main text of the “NW”. (10 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He will make his comparisons out loud (as if talking to himself) and thus bring out the differences of the with other popular versions. His analysis will not merely identify the variant readings but will show why the xVB’ rendering is superior. In one verse it may be a point of grammar that is improved; in another, a matter of accurate translation; the next, modern speech, simplified rendition, explanatory footnote, cross-reference support, etc. He will analyze about five or six verses, and in each one a different point should be brought out. The student mulls over his assignment and decides to use the story or narration as a theme upon which to build his analysis. A fitting introduction is also worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 2: The school servant is in the theocratic ministry school library assisting one of the students with his talk on a chain reference word. For this purpose a brief chain should be selected. (10 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After looking up and reading the chain references, a theme is selected that seems most apropos and embraces the majority of the texts. The dictionary is used to get the full meaning of the word involved. Some Watchtower publications are consulted on the subject for background material. As they go from text to text the school servant shows the student how each text can be woven into the theme, and even the more difficult scriptures are fitted into the theme selected. He also shows him how to line up his material into notes. (In many cases just a few notes in the margin of the A’W, or notes on a small slip of paper, inserted at the text location, will be sufficient.) The fewer notes one has the more extemporaneous will be his delivery and the better his audience contact. Illustrate how connectives can be used to bridge the gap from one text to the next, so as to preserve the coherence of the talk. Since this talk is to be given as on a back-call, an introduction and conclusion will be developed that will fit in with the theme and demonstrate the “back-call style&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 3: Kingdom Hall and time for above student to deliver his talk on the chain word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The student, using his copy of the 1V1F, will deliver a five-minute discourse on the chain discussed in the previous scene, embracing all the points brought out above. (Except for length, this should be a model student talk on a chain reference.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">General Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In analyzing the main text of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font2"> one’s purpose should not be merely to show the differences of the 2VW, when compared with other versions, nor should the story be given in paraphrase style. But an analysis means explaining the whys and wherefores, why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">crowd</span><span class="font2"> is better than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">multitude,</span><span class="font2"> why the A’W leaves out a verse that other versions contain, how the AAV is superior, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">proof</span><span class="font2"> of its accuracy, modern speech, etc. With the chain the purpose is to show the various uses of the word, weave a theme around that word and present it as on a back-call. It is not an analytical discourse like the two talks on the main text. Audience participation should not include counsel to the student. Publishers are to bring out points that were not covered by the student in his analysis. By putting into practical application the above suggested points the ministry school will be enlivened and proceed with greater benefits to all who are seeking to speak the “pure language” according to “accurate knowledge”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Brooklyn Bethel Vacation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">From August 4 to August 19 inclusive the Bethel home, offices and factory printing plant will be closed down to give the family a rest period. No mail or correspondence will be handled during this period.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">There will also be an unavoidable delay during all of August resulting from the accumulation of mail. Bear this in mind by making plans early and ordering needed supplies well in advance of this time. Circuit and district servants will have their vacation during the same two weeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued) </span><span class="font2">At the close of the meeting the following announcements should be made: (a) That, after the meeting is dismissed, the speaker or any of Jehovah’s witnesses will gladly answer any questions on the talk that anyone in the audience may have, (b) That a booklet or magazine will be given free to those desiring it. (The company will pay for these and report placements.) (c) Announce the title of the talk for next week and invite all to attend, (d) Also, extend an invitation to attend the other company meetings, giving time and location. The Society’s publications should always be available after the meeting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> It is the company servant’s responsibility to take the initiative in making arrangements for all public meetings. He, along with the school servant, will select capable speakers from those enrolled in the theocratic ministry school. All servants and publishers should co-operate wholeheartedly by advertising each meeting thoroughly, so that it will be brought to a successful conclusion, namely, that people of good will may be served with the truth through it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> When people of good will come to the meetings, they should be made to feel welcome. Extend a friendly greeting and, where possible, sit with them, answer their questions, introduce them </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to other</span><span class="font2"> brothers, and invite them to return. When sufficiently interested, make arrangements to call at their homes and conduct Bible studies with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Meetings may be held in halls, parks, on lawns, and in outlying localities. For variety in speakers, company servants may arrange for speakers from nearby companies, where possible. Also, one or two talks may be featured at each company book study location every few months. At such times a special effort should be made by those assigned to such study to get all persons of good will to attend these talks. The talks can be forty-five minutes in length, followed by a fifteen-minute study in the publication currently considered by the group. This will serve to introduce the newly interested to our method of group study. General questions may be answered after the meeting is dismissed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> By applying this counsel on the proper conduct of public meetings, and with each company endeavoring to expand its public meeting activity, a further increase in this feature of work will result, to Jehovah’s vindication and the salvation of a great crowd of men of good will.</span></p></li></ul>

The apostle Paul strongly warned of this present time when wicked men and impostors would advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled, and then admonishes, “You, however, continue in the things you learned,” in order to experience Jehovah's sure salvation through Christ Jesus.—2 Tim. 3:14, Sir.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Before Adopting New System</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If your company has any cash items on hand now for which you have not sent the Society the covering remittance, transfer the cost of these items from your Company Cash account to the Literature account as soon as possible. All cash items should be already paid for and belong to the company. Also make an up-to-date audit of your present accounts, following the old accounts instructions, but, whether or not the audit has been completed, it will be all right to begin using the new system July 1. 1951. The circuit servant when he next visits the company will cheek to see that the accounts servant understands the new system, that entries are being made properly, and that the “Hold File” is kept up to date. Carefully follow the instructions and illustrations and you should have no trouble keeping the accounts. If difficulties are encountered that you cannot overcome, you may consult the circuit servant or correspond with the Society.</span></p>

With summer vacation here, the rurals can be given a good coverage with this book. It has had a wide circulation, but there are yet people who need the information in this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Being filled with much practical instruction learned at the district assemblies will also enable all of us to continue in right works. Keep in mind also to maintain the gains in publishers by continuing to help newly interested and irregular publishers in field service. Continue to push the public meeting activity, which can be carried on outdoors during the summer season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not neglect to call back on all those with whom books are placed, and endeavor to start Bible studies. Assist them in learning the way of salvation, and how they can continue therein. The reward of everlasting life is sure. So continue in the things you have learned, and live!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> To help insure proper coverage of all the territory assigned to a company organization, tlie Society appoints the territory servant.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> This can best be done by having a master map of the company's territory, showing the boundaries and numbers of all individual territories.

As these are issued, a record should be kept of the date issued and when they are returned as well as the number of times worked. Each assignment should be returned every six months for a semiannual checkup.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Where territory is entirely business, it should also be covered with the regular offer of literature, and the territory- servant will hold maps for this territory. However, the advertising servant will prepare and issue territory for street and magazine store-to-store work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The territory servant should always have in mind the proper coverage of the company’s territory. It is preferred that companies cover their territories at least twice a year, so the territory servant should arrange for the territory not being covered often to be covered by group witnessing and encourage publishers to obtain certain territories that have not been covered recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> The territory servant can aid the company- servant much in the selection of public meeting locations. Different sections of the city, urban areas, small towns and rurals should all be considered and arrangements made for the most appropriate coverage of the territory with public meetings. When a public meeting is scheduled for a particular area, it will usually be advisable to call in the territory assignments held by publishers in that area. The territory can then be worked uniformly by group witnessing in advertising the public talk and placing the offer for the month. All the interested ones in the area should be invited to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>G</sup> In addition to his duty of seeing that the territory is properly covered and earing for the records in this regard, the territory servant has the chief responsibility, as with any servant, to set a good example in the field and to assist and train others in the preaching work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Week-End Activity Basis for 34 Per Cent Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Action ! Fearless action ! That is the cry of all the Bible prophecies at this late period of the world’s “time of the end’’. While the enemy will attempt to discourage, disrupt and otherwise interfere with the united activity of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, nevertheless, we will not become paralyzed with fear so that our voices will become stilled or our hands droop helplessly in inaction. Jehovah reigns! Christ Jesus is King! The Kingdom is established! This is good news, and it must be preached. So, “Fear not, droop not your hands,” is Jehovah’s divine command to his consecrated witnesses in this day.—Zeph. 3:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> How appropriate it is then that our hands be actively engaged in presentingthe </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine to the peoples of the nations, since it is the magazine that announces the reign of Jehovah and his consort King, Christ Jesus, in Kingdom power. Fearlessly and willingly, then, as loyal subjects of Jehovah’s King, we will continue to offer a one-year subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> with the 3-booklet premium. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World, Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth,?</span><span class="font5"> and any other self-covered booklet, on a contribution of $1.00. A subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and the 3-booklet premium can be offered as an alternative if the person is already a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup>April draws the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">campaign to a close. A four-month quota of 16 subscriptions for pioneers and 2 for company publishers was set. Have you attained your quota yet? If not, then redouble your efforts during this last month of the campaign. Work with a will and with enthusiasm. “Droop not your hands,” either through laziness or fear. Be certain to call back on all subscription prospects. Likewise, call on former subscribers whose names are listed on the Subscription Record Sheet (S-10) and the expiration slips sent to the companies, and arouse the original interest they had for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Learn the cause for their lapse of interest or failure to resubscrlb.e, and then demonstrate why and how </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower should be</span><span class="font5"> studied at this time. Don’t forget to visit the ones who subscribed in the early</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">months of the campaign, and further stimulate their interest.</span></p>

Be sure to follow through by continuing to train these new ones to be constant in their field service so that their hands will not droop into inactivity.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Droop Not Your Hands” </span><span class="font5">(Cont’d) come regular In the service. Aiding others who are new or those whose hands have drooped in active service will prevent our hands from drooping in Jehovah’s service and will make possible a 34 per cent increase of publishers in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings to Aid Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The public meeting series should get off to a rousing start. Vital, decisive and stirring talks in the new series will stimulate this feature of service, and will undoubtedly aid tremendously toward the 34 per cent publisher increase during April. Hence, halls should be lined up, handbills ordered, and the assigned speakers ready to deliver well-prepared talks. Servants and publishers can keep their hands active in service by handbill distribution and advertising. Extend an inviting hand to those whom you call on or with whom you conduct home Bible studies to come along with you to the public talks. Will you do your part in attaining the 34 per cent increase?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Bring the 13th </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign to a successful close by meeting or even surpassing your individual subscription quota. Work diligently for the desired 34 per cent increase by helping someone out into the service in April. Take advantage of the opportunities for uicreased service activity following the Memorial and opening of the new public meeting series. Theocracy is on the increase ! Therefore, “droop not your hands.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many companies are continually changing the address to which their literature orders are shipped. This causes much confusion, loss of time and delay in handling orders. Oftentimes the address -of the Kingdom Hall is used, with the result that freight companies are unable to deliver the orders because no one is there to receive the shipment; or it is necessary to give two addresses, one for shipping and another for notification. For these reasons it is better to Mse </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one address</span><span class="font5"> that can be used both for freight and mail. We would prefer that all orders be sent to the name and address of the company servant, for then we can use the address stencil that is in our files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you must have your shipments sent to someone other than the company servant, we suggest that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">address</span><span class="font5"> of some other servant be selected who can conveniently receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> orders. Then use this same address each time you order<sup>-</sup> literature. Your co-operation on these points will facilitate handling your orders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To a Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When presenting the good news in the field, how do you deal with this response: “I am a Catholic and I go to the big church up the street’’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might tactfully reply, “I am glad to know that you believe in God and ate interested in serving the Lord. Without doubt that is why you go to church, and it is to further help God-fearing persons such as you that this work is done. You know, in my work I meet Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others, and all of these ask the same questions. They want to know what the world is coming to, whether or not it will be afflicted by another war, or if there will ever be real peace. They want to know if God has destined man to his present plight, and just what they can expect of God in the future. Haven’t you often thought of these same questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, and the fact that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> ask these same questions proves that they are not getting them answered in their respective churches. That is why this work of free Bible education is so necessary, because only in your Bible can you find unprejudiced and reliable answers to these questions. To aid you in an orderly study of your Bible, this valuable publication </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has been provided. Hundreds of thousands use it in their personal study and find that it faces these questions squarely and answers them right from the Holy Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Is it a Catholic magazine?” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1951 District Assemblies </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">to begin arranging your affairs in order to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Check on transportation facilities and schedules, till out the Hoorn Request form promptly and accurately, and enthusiastically invite all persons to have a share with you in this feast of the pure language. All mail regarding these assemblies should be addressed to the Watchtower Convention Committee for the attention of the proper department (rooming, volunteer service, installation, etc.) at the city where the assembly is to be held. Remember: If you write for rooms, accept </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and occupy them.</span><span class="font5"> This in itself Is a good witness and shows forth the proper Christian attitude of good conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers on the list prior to March 1, 1951, will again be assisted by the Society by being provided</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No, it is not a Catholic magazine, but neither are many of the daily newspapers and magazines you read. Neither are the radio and television, or the movies, and many of the schools and colleges to which millions of Catholics-go every day for information. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is a guide to the Scriptures, which foretell present conditions and describe our only hope for peace: and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is the only magazine doing this. Look, the last printing of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was 1,235,000 copies in 35 languages. It is a magazine for everybody. Many Catholics read it and like it very much. Just to illustrate what you can learn through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> see what it says in this paragraph . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you do not obtain a subscription, you might say, “Why not take this copy to read? It is only 5c. I will stop next week to see what you think of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When next week comes, be sure to call on such persons. If they are sheep, they will be expecting you. Be prepared to discuss and present the good news to them and other members of the family. Take along your Douay Version Bible, if you have one. Do not hastily tear down their religion, but rather endeavor to build up good will by tactfully overcoming objections. Show them that you have good news they need and which they can get from no other source. The sheep will respond. —2 Tim. 2: 24-26, .VW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These same suggestions can be used with a bound book or other publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">with meal tickets. Do not lose these: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no others will be issued.</span><span class="font5"> You may select the assembly city that you choose. Pioneers should not, however. go to the assembly city ahead of time unless the Society calls them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The district assemblies will play a large part in praising Jehovah more and more and in attaining the 34 per cent increase over last year's peak of publishers. Come prepared to attend each session, bring literature for witnessing and bring someone with you to the assembly for feasting and service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As all features of Kingdom service increase in tempo, more and more good-will persons are being found and many new faces appear at the Kingdom Hall. These strangers, present for the first time, are not acquainted with God’s people as a group and are observing very intently what goes on. Their first impression of the organization is usually a lasting one. For that reason, it is necessary to know how to treat these strangers when they come to our meetings. This demonstration should show how to treat them before, during and after the meeting.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: Two publishers are conversing Just before the meeting is to begin. A person walks in the door and takes a seat in the back row, all by himself. The two publishers notice him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This scene should demonstrate how a stranger should be greeted when he first enters the hall. The two publishers can discuss whether or not they are acquainted with him and one will decide that he will go and find out who the stranger is. He goes over to the stranger and introduces himself in a friendly manner and engages him in a conversation. The publisher then explains that this is the Kingdom Hall where Jehovah's witnesses meet to study God's Word together, and offers to show him around. Then he can show him the various features of the Kingdom Hall, such as the yeartext, the library, the stock counter where literature can be obtained, the advertising department, etc., explaining briefly the functions of each one. Then it will be time for the meeting to begin and they will sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: The publisher is seated beside the stranger as the meeting progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since it is the service meeting, various publications will be studied, and, of course, the stranger has none of them. So as each one is studied, the publisher should offer to let the stranger look on with him. (That is one of the reasons why he sat beside the stranger, because he knew that the stranger would not be prepared for the meeting and would feel quite helpless without some assistance.) The stranger appreciates this very much because now he knows what is going on and he benefits from the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD SCENE: The meeting is Over and the publisher is again talking with the stranger. He proceeds to introduce him to the servants, procures an “Informant” for him, and then introduces him to other publishers in the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those to whom the stranger is introduced should accept the introduction warmly and in a friendly manner. Finally, before the stranger leaves, the publisher arranges for him to return again, informs him of the times of other meetings and tells him of the programs for such meetings. Getting the stranger acquainted with the publishers and the meetings is a very important part of welcoming him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">general points:</span><span class="font5"> It should be kept in mind that a friendly, receptive spirit should prevail throughout. The stranger should be made to feel right at home, however not made to feel too conspicuous, but readily accepted into our midst. The stranger will feel like returning again, and in an atmosphere such as this, he will begin to take in life-giving knowledge from the table of Jehovah. A stranger should be a stranger only once, and that once should be only on his first visit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">District Assembly Forms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are sending pioneers and companies a supply of Room Request and Volunteer Service forms. If you need more, write for them. Servants, discuss the instructions on this form at one of the service meetings, and explain that the forms, after being filled out, are to be mailed to the assembly city each chooses to attend. Prompt action in requesting desired accommodations will help the Rooming committees to get for you the best possible accommodations. Show love for your brothers by volunteering your services at the assembly. Please take care of these matters immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Use U. S. Mailboxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time it has been called to the attention of the Society by Post Office officials that publishers, when in the witness work, leave handbills and other advertising material in mail- and letterboxes. This is illegal and contrary to postal regulations and is punishable by a fine of $300. Mail- and letterboxes are for the use of mailmen, and only for matter on which postage has been paid. It would be appreciated if all publishers would remember this fact and refrain from leaving handbills, publications, or other printed matter in mail- or letterboxes </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Vacation Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With summer vacations “just around the corner”, children of school age are once again invited to enter the vacation pioneer service. And why not? What better way could there be to spend the summer months than by devoting full-time service in praise to Jehovah! How much more practical for these youths to so remember their Creator than to spend these months in idle play or in the selfish pursuits of this world I Think seriously about it, young publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Vacation pioneer service is a forward step in your chosen career as a minister of Jehovah God. It will help you grow in maturity and understanding of the truth; you will develop a keener appreciation of your privilege of serving the Most High; you will realize more fully your responsibility as a consecrated follower of Christ and you will become better equipped for efficient service. Yes, you will be laying </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">solid foundation for the future, and vacation pioneer work might well be the turning point of your life, namely, the start of a life career of fulltime praise with bright prospects of Gilead schooling, foreign missionary work and other joyful opportunities ahead of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year 858 enrolled as vacation pioneers, our highest figure thus far. Many of these will again renew this refreshing experience. Parents can co-operate with their children and, realizing what it means for them, assist them to see the advantages of becoming vacation pioneers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">fact, it may be possible for many parents to join their children and enjoy pioneer life during the summer months. Remember, the vacation pioneer service is not restricted to those of school age. It is open at any time of the year<sup>-</sup> to anyone who is baptized and has been a publisher for six months, and who can devote at least two months in the full-time work. Many of the older publishers who cannot stand the rigors of winter weather can take advantage of the warmer months to enjoy the rich blessings of vacation pioneering. Why not try it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1951 should see a new peak of vacation pioneer publishers. Will YOU be among them? Write us now for your application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now it is more imperative than ever that “every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities”, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The heavens, earth, sea and things therein belong to Jehovah by right of creation. He is man’s Life-giver. Hence man's first obligation is to Jehovah. And so Jehovah's witnesses and their companions, impelled by a theocratically trained conscience, continue to give the Kingdom witness despite opposition and persecution, in order that “every soul” may become subject to the superior authorities.—Rom. 13:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font5">II’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During May and June we have the splendid opportunity to help others learn such proper subjection by presenting afield the excellent Bible study aid </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Menns Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font5"> along with a 32-page self-covered booklet, on a 35c contribution.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible Study Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The privilege and responsibility of the Bible study servant is to oversee and care for the back-call and Bible study activity. He will set a proper example by engaging in the back-call and Bible study work, while his chief concern will be to assist other publishers in making back-calls and starting and conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- The Bible study servant can ascertain which publishers need assistance b.v regularly checking the Publisher’s Record cards. He will endeavor to tactfully aid his fellow worker by offering to take him along in the baek-call work, show him how it is done and aid him in starting home Bible studies. Assistance to the publishers in larger companies can be rendered by the Bible study servant's working through the com-puny book study arrangement, rotating from group to group.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In large companies it would be well for the Bible study servant to have an assistant so that he can have more opportunity to work with the publishers. He will also enlist the aid of other publishers and pioneers who are active and efficient in the back-call and Bible study work. The Bible study servant may assign these to assist the various-publishers needing aid, and thus make them their personal charge until they have been sufficiently trained.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">will include a record of all the home Bible studies held by both the publishers and pioneers, as well as each of the company meetings. The Bible study servant will receive the Study Reports from the assistant company servant and will post the information from them on the Study Record slips, making out a new Study Record slip for any new studies started. The Study Record slip need no longer be filed under the territory number, but can be filed alphabetically according to the name of the householder, if this is more advantageous in your company. However, the territory number will continue to be recorded, though filed alphabetically. If a publisher is unable to continue a study and cannot find another to take care of it, then the Bible study servant should be informed of this so he can arrange for another publisher to care for it. He will also work closely with the territory servant, furnishing any information regarding studies and goodwill data that may be necessary, when territory is assigned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> With the Bible study servant diligently and systematically fulfilling his responsibility of giving loving assistance to his fellow publishers, and all the publishers in turn cooperating with him in the same spirit, Jehovah’s organization will continue to be blessed with theocratic increase.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Someone told you the good news of the Kingdom. You listened to it, learned to appreciate it and then started telling others about it. The one who told you also continues to tell others, and daily the number of Kingdom proclaimers grows. It is this chain reaction going on throughout the whole world that makes it possible for more and more to hear the good news of the Kingdom, learn to appreciate it, and, in turn, aid still others to know of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Are you not glad that someone took the time to tell you that good news, which is as soothing “as cool water to a thirsty soul”? Yes, you are. And you can now prove your appreciation to the Provider of the good news, Jehovah God, by employing your ‘ability to use your mouth and to make known the sacred secret of the good news’ at every opportunity.—Eph. 6: 19, .Vil’.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer “The Watchtower”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> During February, the second month of the 13th annual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtaiver</span><span class="font3"> campaign, we will continue to offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> (or, if the person is already a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriber, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> may be offered), with a three-booklet premium, for $1, the yearly rate. Take the initiative and energetically present the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom. Etigage regularly in door-to-door work. Call on those whose subscriptions have expired. Make regular back-calls and be alert to every other opportunity for witnessing. This will result in many subscriptions’ being obtained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Have you experienced the joy of obtaining a subscription? By the end of February each company publisher should have obtained at least one subscription, while each pioneer should have obtained a minimum of 8 subscriptions. Using the valuable features of the magazine in an effective presentation will help you to obtain subscriptions. Point out that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> contains the best news. This can be done effectively only if the publishers have diligently prepared their presentation in advance and are thereby familiar with the magazine’s contents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Interest</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> But taking a subscription is only the first step in aiding one to get the good news. Now that they have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtouer,</span><span class="font3"> they must be aided to appreciate it. Since this can best be done by making back-calls, a real effort should be made to call back on each new subscriber. Show them that you were not interested merely in taking their subscription, but that you want to assist them to get the full benefit of the magazine’s contents. To do this effectively, you must be prepared when calling back. When they say on your return, as they often do, “No, I haven’t had a chance to read the magazine yet,”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Have a Fuller Share in Theocracy’s Increase</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Glance through the 1951 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font3"> What is most outstanding? Is it not Theocracy’s remarkable increase? And what accomplished it? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Work! Working with a purpose.</span><span class="font3"> ‘As a man sows, so shall he reap,’ and in harmony with this Scriptural rule Jehovah’s servants have sowed purposefully, watered patiently and diligently and God has given the increase. You are thrilled at the part you have had In it. Yet, would you like to have an even greater share in it? You can by enrolling </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font3"> as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Because the pioneer service is a joyful one does not mean that it is a carefree, happy-go-lucky life. It is a full-time job that carries weighty responsibilities. If you desire to pioneer, know what is required of you and plan accordingly. For example; have something definite in mind to talk about. Be familiar with the articles in the issue you are using so that you can refer them to the magazine and they can see the advantage of reading it. By using the magazine effectively, you will set a good example for them, as they see that you appreciate the magazine enough yourself to read it and make known its good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Try to start a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study with them, for it will greatly aid them to understand and fully appreciate the good news. Such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study can be counted as a home Bible study and should be reported at the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> By our getting out into the field service this month and offering </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer,</span><span class="font3"> many of the “other sheep” will be located. By following up the placements, they will be assisted to understand the refreshing Kingdom news, which will cause them to show their appreciation by blending their voices with yours in making known the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers are required to meet a minimum quota of 100 hours a month, or 1,200 hours per service year. Realize, first of all, that this is a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">minimum</span><span class="font3"> quota, not a maximum requirement. To meet it a pioneer must average four hours a day. Hence, plan your time, not simply to meet the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">minimum</span><span class="font3"> quota, but set your goal above the minimum requirements and allow yourself a margin for unforeseen emergencies. Do not let every little thing that comes up during a day’s activity interfere with or interrupt your service schedule. Neither let the fact that you do not have to punch a time clock make you negligent or lax about your service. Get out early in the morning, put your pioneer service first, and let nothing distract you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> However, there is more to pioneering than just meeting the hour </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>London Convention August 1-5</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> London convention delegates who want to travel by boat should make their own application for space to and from Europe through local travel agents or with the steamship companies direct. There are three classes of boat travel: Tourist Class, Cabin Class and First Class. Tourist Class is cheapest, running about $350 round trip: the other two classes are proportionately higher. If you definitely decide to make the trip, put down a deposit for space with the travel agency or steamship company and as soon as the space is confirmed, purchase your ticket for the going and return trips. Only then will you be assured of space for the round trip. Some of the steamship lines serving Europe are the Canadian Pacific (leaving from Canadian ports for Liverpool), Cunard, Holland-America, United States Lines and French Line. The Society presently holds 50 berths in Cabin Class on the S. S. “America” (United States Lines), which sails from New York on July 21. This space is for eastbound only and does </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> include the return voyage: that will have to be arranged separately. The one-way minimum fare would be $230. Anyone interested in taking these reservations should write the Convention Desk.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Air Travel</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In order to get charter air service, the Society will have to know how many persons are going and on what dates they want to leave and return. If you have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">deffnitelu</span><span class="font3"> decided to go to the London convention and you want to travel by air. then write to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York, London Convention Desk, giving your name, address, age, citizenship, date you desire to leave the United States or Canada, whether you will attend the Paris assembly too, and the date of departure from Europe to the United States. Those desiring to travel on the same plane should list on the same sheet of paper till of the information requested. Some may attend both the London and Paris assemblies. (The Paris convention is August 9 to 12.) In that event one must allow at least one day to return from Paris to London, where planes for the U. S. will leave. (Whether planes will leave from Paris Is still questionable.) On receipt of this information the Society will be able to make reservations for you and write you when to send us the money for your round-trip ticket. Roundtrip air travel will probably cost about $400. Please be very definite</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>On the Streets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">’Among the many thousands walking up and down the sidewalks of the busy streets are persons never reached with the Kingdom message through the house-to-house work. Working odd hours, traveling as salesmen or construction workers. living in hotels, inaccessible at their business offices, etc., these persons are entitled to, and must be reached with, the good news of God's kingdom. This can be done by displaying and offering the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awuke!</span><span class="font3"> magazines on the streets.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> “But I don’t seem to place any magazines even though I spend several hours in the magazine work.” some publishers remark. Experience shows that many more magazines will be placed by taking the initiative and calling out slogans as well as approaching and presenting the magazines to the people. Use appealing slogans to arouse the interest of the passers-by’, such as, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> dispenses life-giving knowledge. Get your copy for only 5c.&quot; “If you want truth and facts, get the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> Only 5c a copy.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Shoppers who momentarily pause to look at something in a shop window might be approached in this manner: “Pardon me. Have you ever read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine? These are serious times and I’m sure you are keenly interested as to how they might affect you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will prove to be a source of real comfort and enlightenment Io you, as it discusses these perilous (imes in the light of Bible prediction, and points to God’s kingdom as man’s only hope. A copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is only 5c.” about your desired date of departure from New York, Chicago or Toronto and your desired date of departure from Europe.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Probable departure dates from New Y'ork (and other points in the U.S. and Canada) will be July 27, 28 and 29. The return trip to the United States via chartered plane will have to be made before August 31, 1951. Report the date you want to return and then the Society will advise you as to the schedule of your return flight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> If you are undecided about going to Europe, no not bepobt to the Society. If you know definitely you are going, then report by March 1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> There are those persons waiting for a bus or streetcar that can be approached like this: “Hello! Ever read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazine? May I suggest that you obtain the latest copy and examine it as you ride the bus home. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will acquaint you with uncensored information that will keep you awake to the vital issues of the times. It is only 5c :i copy.” These introductions can be elaborated on by opening the magazines and showing some of the fine features contained in them if time and opportunity permit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Street Conduct</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> It takes courage to approach people, but it likewise takes courage for people either standing or passing by to approach you to take a magazine. If we approach the people, we make it much easier for them. Be congenial and friendly. All may not accept your offer when approached. but you will find that many who have been too timid to come up and ask you for a cop\ will take the magazines when you present them this way. Never give the appearance of being apologetic for doing your work. Yet, never act rude or discourteous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> It is recommended that publish ers stand by themselves in street magazine work, unless a publisher is training another, in which case it is suggested that they stand about ten feet or so apart rather than close together. The tendency of publishers to converse with one another will thus be avoided, and the people who are yet unacquainted with the Kingdom message will receive the benefit and blessing of such knowledge.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">1951, as instructed herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> At present, American citizens traveling to Britain and France will need a U. S. passport, but no visas. For full information on obtaining the necessary travel documents, write the Department of State, Passport. Division, Washington, D. C., or contact the clerk of a United States District Court, if there is one in your vicinity.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective back-calls stimulate and advance Kingdom interests. The demonstration outlined below should show by contrast how ineffective a back-call Is when the publisher IS not properly prepared and how simple it Is to make effective back-calls when a few minutes are spent in preparing and how helpful such calls are to people of good will. If we are to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">realize a 34 per cent increase in the peak number of</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> publishers this year, effective back-calls must be made. This demonstration should be from 15 to 20 minutes in length.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: (Part one) The publisher has just completed door-to-door witnessing and Is talking aloud to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having time to spare he decides to make a back-call. Taking out the house-to-house record sheet, a woman with whom literature was placed is selected and the publisher makes the call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: (Part two) Publisher is at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following a brief introduction, he asks, “Have you had a chance to read the magazine I left?” “No,” is the answer for one reason or another. Having nothing definite in mind that he can turn to in the magazine, the publisher can only make general comtnents to the effect that the magazine contains good information and that it should be read. He offers the householder another magazine, suggests that it be read and is about to leave when her husband makes an appearance, saying he has read the magazine and likes it. The publisher, not being familiar with the articles, says he is glad it has been read, hopes the one just left will be read also and leaves with the promise to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: (Part one) Publisher is at home, talking to himself, preparing for back-call work that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His house-to-house record sheet reveals the previous week’s placements were mostly January 1, 1951, copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Taking that issue of the magazine in hand, the publisher starts looking for an article that could be used on almost any call. He realizes that he cannot memorize the entire is^ue, so he seeks something that will catch the good-will person’s interest, be simple to understand and something upon which a further witness could be given should the opportunity present Itself. He comes across the “Questions from Readers” column, page 31, and notes the question, If God knew all things, then why did he create creatures that would fail?’ He decides to use this point on his calls, noting that it can be used to tie in other articles in the magazine for further discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: (Part two) Publisher at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following a brief friendly introduction, he opens a copy of the January 1, 1951, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and says, “I don’t know whether you have had a chance </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> read this or not, but what do you think </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3"> this question, ‘If God knew all things, then why did he create creatures that would fall when put under test?’ ” After letting the party express his views, he then points out that he learned </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">from the article</span><span class="font3"> that God knew his purposes would succeed before he started creation, that God’s purposes are predestinated, but not creatures' lives, and that creatures must choose life or death for themselves. Then build up the witness showing how one must have knowledge to serve God and choose the way that leads to life. Turning to the main article, the publisher can show the great number now being helped to that end, then how the magazine’s purpose is to aid people to know of God so that they can serve him. He concludes the call by arranging to return for a further discussion of the magazine’s contents, thus laying the groundwork for a home Bible study.</span></p>

Pioneers are also required to engage in every feature of Kingdom service. Sometimes we have a tendency to specialize in one feature of activity, such as street work or back-calls and Bible studies, and neglect the other features, either because we feel we can do that feature of the work better than the others or, oftentimes, because it is an easy way to “put in time”. However, by so doing, we miss the real </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">purpose</span><span class="font3"> of our service, which is to find and feed the “sheep”. By participating proportionately in every feature of service you will become a well-balanced pioneer who can effectively wield the “sword of the spirit” in whatever field of battle you are engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> In working with a purpose you must make the most of your time. You must be efficient, yes, proficient, in your service. So do not go out merely so you can “count time”, but make your time </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">count.</span><span class="font3"> Do not waste or squander your efforts and energy, but endeavor to accomplish some-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Warning Draft Registrants</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Some of Jehovah's witnesses who have registered under the draft and claimed classification as ministers and conscientious objectors have been visited by agents of the FBI and asked unlawfully to sign statements relinquishing their rights as conscientious objectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Counsel advises that registrants who are ministers may also claim to be conscientious objectors and the board of appeal is entitled to have complete information on both claims. It is not necessary, therefore, that Jehovah’s witnesses sign statements for FBI agents giving up their claim as conscientious objectors in order to be classified as ministers. Both claims may properly be raised at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a letter to Hayden Covington, stated : “You are advised that Agents of this Bureau have been specifically instructed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not to</span><span class="font3"> persuade or coerce any person to waive either his claim as a minister or a conscientious objector . . .”</span></p>

He must have a good knowledge of the Scriptures and an accurate knowledge of instructions and communications issued by the Society. Therefore, he is the one to take the initiative in reconciling difficulties and adjusting any problems arising in the company that would retard Kingdom expansion.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Instructions, supplies, and information received from the Society are to be passed on to the company and servants to whom they apply. The Society appoints other servants to assist the company servant In getting the work done. The company servant must be familiar with the duties, work and records of all the other servants and will periodically check on the work and records of these assistants. When a servant cannot handle all his work alone, the company servant will sblect someone to assist him. If a servant does not fully understand his duties or has become a little lax in performing them, the company servant will show love for his assistant by devoting some time to help him become more proficient.</span></p></li>

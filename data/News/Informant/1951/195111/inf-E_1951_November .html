<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Back-Calls and Bible Studies to Be Emphasized</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The flood of expansion is on! The Lord’s sheep are hearing his voice and are pouring out of this system of things. This is a torrent of increase that will continue on until the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah, declares that our work is finished. And how is this increase coming about? Why, by the cultivation of “the right kind of soil” and by Jehovah’s blessing on this work so that those “hearing the word and getting the sense of it” really bear fruit manyfold.—Matt. 13:23, AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During the month of November, to aid us in our cultivating work, we will be placing three bound books, preferably including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life’’,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of $1.00. These aids can be used in several ways, as we shall see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Bearing fruit manyfold means seeing an increase in publishers and general service activity. To achieve this result, we must do more than just break up the soil and plant the seed with the initial presentation of the offer. We must weed, water and loosen the soil around the seed. That means making back-calls on the persons with whom the books have been placed, re-arousing their interest and pointing out ways in Which the seed of truth which has been planted can be made to sprout and grow in their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Producing the Fruit</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Of the various soils, only the “right kind of soil” brings forth good fruit. By zealously following up all interest found we can definitely determine which is right soil. Hence, it is the responsibility of each publisher to follow up the interest he finds. If he does not, the seed cannot be expected to bear fruit. On the other hand, if we do make the effort in this matter, Jehovah is certain to bless it with increase.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> But, again, we do not stop with back-calls. Home Bible studies, using the books as study aids, must be started if the good-will persons are to advance toward maturity. From the home Bible study such ones will get the basic knowledge and understanding of God’s Word that helps them send roots down deep so that they cannot be choked out or plucked up by the birds. Thus they grow in the accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The fruit is finally harvested when the new interest are taken out into the field service. If they are properly trained in regularity and proper presentation of the good news they continue the cycle that produces- fruit as much as a hundredfold. They cannot be left to stand alone until they are sufficiently mature and strong in God’s Word. Otherwise they might, as tender young buds cut from the tree, wither and die.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased Activity Vital</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> It is true that there has been an increase in back-call and Bible study activity in this country. However, reports show that there </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Many Respond as Pioneers</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Among those who have responded in thunderous tones to this most cherished invitation, there are the 6,166 full-time servants of Jehovah who have heard his voice, and their answer is similar to that of the prophet Isaiah, as the.v unitedly cry out, “Here am 11 send me.” (Isa. 6': 8, AT) No ordinary invitation is this, but a call from the eternal King, Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> We are living in the day of Theocracy’s increase and we share in the joy of seeing the actual fulfillment of prophecy. Our eyes witness God as being true to his promises. Are we only to gaze and stare at this wondrous fulfillment of promised expansion or can we have a</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Hell-Fire Tract Correctior</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The following correction in the Hell-Fire tract should be noted by all Kingdom publishers. On page 3, paragraph 1, in lines 2-4, the portion of the first sentence under the subtitle “What Does the Bible Say?” reads. . . but, please note, the expression ‘hell-fire’ is not to be found, and there is a vast difference.” This should read as follows: “. . . but the expression ‘hell-fire’ is not translated from the same original Greek words, which makes a vast difference </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(gehenna</span><span class="font4"> is used, not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hades).’’</span><span class="font4"> All publishers will please study and become familiar with this correction so that all will be fully equipped to explain any questions that may arise relative to this matter in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(NOTE : Tracts should be ordered in lots of 250 of each tract; for example, 250, 500, 1.000, etc., as the Society will not be filling orders for less than 250 of any one particular tract. Companies may supply the tracts to the publishers in quantities desired, based on the. same rate paid to the Society, such as 65 for 5e, when they have been received in lots of 1,000. Tracts are cash items, therefore a remittance should -accompany your order.) greater share in this invitation to “praise Jah”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah is the great director of this chorus of praise to his name. From and after 1018 he sent forth the call, &quot;Who will go for us?” and, “Enter into the joy of your master.” We have had the cue, what more do w’e need to join in the life-giving melody and song? We must now give our best so that the song will reach the ears of all who have righteous hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The chorus is made up of those who really and sincerely desire to be used by the Lord and who actually do sing forth His praises. At first we participate in the chorus by being good company publishers. With this requirement met, the next question is, How can we have a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Here Am I! Send Me &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Conf A)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">greater share in this song of praise and respond more fully to the invitation? This is made possible by being used as ministers in a fulltime capacity—pioneering! Yes, these are the ones who are ready to heed the voice of the Lord now and are most fully qualified and able to share to the fullest extent in answering the question, “Whom shall I send?” They say, “Send me.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Does that mean that just a limited few can be pioneers? Definitely not! All who have completely dedicated themselves to do the will of Jehovah have the opportunity to take advantage of this privilege. If you have participated in the field service regularly for at least six months after having submitted to water Immersion, you are eligible. The pioneer is one reporting full time, to the extent of at least 100 hours a month, or 1,200 hours a year, in Kingdom preaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The voice issuing forth from the throne says: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him.” (Rev. 19:5, A<sup>r</sup>W) Who is in the most logical position to fulfill this command of continuous eulogy? If you answer that it is the one who does all he possibly can in service to his Creator, your reply is correct. So you see why Jehovah in his Word holds forth pioneering for all, and as time goes on we can expect to see this group of full-time praisers grow and expand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> In many cases, whatever your present station of life is, by wise planning, use of foresight, an organized schedule, good conscientious work, reliance on Jehovah’s promises and by prayer, you can be a pioneer. Strong determination, courage and faith are needed in this full-time work of setting the prisoners free. Practical information and illustrations on how to get into the pioneer ranks and then remain there will be considered in subsequent issues of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> An automobile, trailer or substantial living quarters are not the things essential to be in the pioneer service. If we plan to have these things before we enter the full-time work, we may never taste of the real pleasures and joy of pioneering. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">can easily become a slave to this old system of things by craving, submitting to and striving to fulfill the desires of the flesh. “Keep on . . . seeking first the kingdom,” said Jesus, “and all these other things will be added to you.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Consider too that there are many in the world who are tied down and chained to old world traditions and philosophies. How dark must their future look to them without any hope! As a pioneer you have so much more time to get to all of the people in your territory, to</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Through Bible Tracts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part Two)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup>A mature dedicated servant of the Lord appreciates fully that he must live a life of praise to Jehovah all the time. Necessarily, then, he must follow the command: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, . . . with all longsuffering and art of teaching.” He must be ‘always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of him a reason for the hope in him'.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The four tracts recently released by the Society were designed particularly to aid us to always be ready to effectively present the good news. In our daily routine we are continually coming in contact with people, either when out in the field service or when doing necessary work to sustain ourselves in the ministry. Let us not waste these opportunities to preach the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> For instance, the housewife can keep a supply of tracts conveniently placed at home and use them in witnessing to those who call, such as deliverymen, salesmen, neighbors, etc. To the neighbor that drops by for a few minutes she might say: “I’ve talked to you several times about the Bible and what Jehovah’s witnesses believe. Here’s a little tract that discusses the primary doctrines of the Bible and Scrip-turally shows what Jehovah’s witnesses believe. Read it over and I'll be happy to discuss it with you sometime when I’m over to see you.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> A brother riding the bus or streetcar to work in the morning engages in conversation with the person beside him. World conditions predominate in the conversation and, perplexed, the stranger asks: “Why is it that something can’t be done about this awful state of affairs? People are so Indifferent.” No time call back on all of the book placements you make and aid them to clear their beclouded minds. Refreshing to them will be the news of the new world promises. The future you seek is before you ; measure your steps wisely by making up your mind to join the chorus of full-time praisers in the united cry, “Here am I! send me.”</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The brother who is a farmer and known by all in the community to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses may engage in conversation with his supplier of needed items for the farm. The discussion turns to Jehovah’s witnesses and he inquires: “Is it true that Jehovah’s witnesses have connections with the Communists as claimed by many?” The brother can briefly explain: “No, for Jehovah's witnesses are hated by the Communists and are outlawed in Russia as well as other countries behind the Iron Curtain. They have no connections with such futile organizations of men but put their trust entirely in Jehovah God and his kingdom. I have a tract here that goes into this matter briefly. Rend it over and let me know what you think about it next week when I call.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>G</sup> The younger brothers can use the tracts in witnessing to their friends at school. In a discussion of God’s punishment for the wicked, the subject of hell-fire comes up. The young publisher might say: “My family doesn’t believe in hell-fire, they believe what the Bible teaches about it, and here’s a little tract that proves what hell really is,”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Yes, tracts open the way for many fine discussions. The shop and office workers can use them when talking to their fellow workers while eating lunch or otherwise. While traveling, we can supplement our verbal witness with appropriate tracts. In many cases they will serve as the first step in arousing interest. Be sure to follow up this interest whenever possible. Use every opportunity to effectively preach the good news through the tracts.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to harvest a crop a farmer must first of all plant seed. But that Is not all that Is necessary, for he must also water and cultivate It. If he is going to give the seed proper attention, he must know exactly where It is sown. The same principle applies in our ministry work. We must not only plant seed in the field by placing publications or stirring up initial interest, but the place of planting must be properly marked so the seed can be watered and cared for through the back-call and Bible-study work. In the following demonstration, Scene 1 illustrates the need for keeping a record of interest located and Scene tl illustrates, not only the gratifying results, but how simple it is to keep such a record.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE ONE: Start with publisher making current offer for the month on the doorstep of householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1 (4 minutes) </span><span class="font4">Householder shows interest in what is said and takes offer. Publisher encourages householder to read publication and to make a note of points he wants clarified, since he desires to call back to answer questions and discuss the subject further. Publisher leaves and, talking aloud to himself, says the contact just made was the best he has had in a long time and that he had better make a record of it for future reference. Going through his book bag, clothing, etc., he finds he has nothing on which to keep a record. He consoles himself by saying, “I’ll remember that one. I won’t forget a call like that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2 (3 minutes) </span><span class="font4">Householder, who remains on the platform while publisher is talking to himself in front of house, manifests real interest in what was said and sits down to read publication. Another member of family comes in and householder starts telling of the interesting discussion he had with a minister who said he would call back at a later time. Part 2 closes with householder commenting, “I'm glad he said he would come back, for I want to hear more about that religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 3 (3 minutes) </span><span class="font4">q'i<sub>le</sub> publisher is back in his territory trying to remember where placement was made. After wandering around territory for awhile, he sees a place that looks familiar and, deciding it is the home of his call, goes to the door. An unfamiliar person answers the door instead of the original good-will person. He asks if the son or brother or father is at home. When advised the householder lives there alone, publisher replies he must have the wrong house. Heaving the house he tells himself he must be more careful in keeping a record so he can follow up interest and water the seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE TWO: The same publisher, engaged in door-to-door work, presents the offer to another householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1 (5 minutes) </span><span class="font4">The householder manifests interest and accepts the offer. Being friendly and desiring to secure the name of the householder for future calls, he offers his naihe and in return receives the name of householder. Arrangements are made for a return visit and encouragement is given to householder to study the literature taken. On departing from house, publisher- makes a mental note of house number and, after walking down the street, stops to make a written note of householder's name, address, publication placed; subject of interest discussed and date back-call is to lie made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2 (5 minutes) </span><span class="font4">The publisher is in the territory and, upon consulting the record he made, has no doubt regarding the back-call he is to make. He has the person’s name and address, what was placed, subject discussed and is on time for the call. Witli confidence he goes to the door, greets the householder by name and effectively assists the person of good will with refreshing waters of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Gener'al Points: </span><span class="font4">For the convenience of publishers who find it advantageous to use, the House-to-Ilouse Record has been provided by the Society. However, small notebooks or any other similar device may be used by the publisher to note the important basic points outlined above. In addition to keeping a record of interest found, a record of ‘not at homes’ should be kept so the territory can lie completely worked.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bearing Fruit Manyfold </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Con</span><span class="font4"> t’d) finding and then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">returning to feed </span><span class="font4">the Lord’s other sheep. Experienced publishers can assist those needing help to get started. In this way we really show our love for- Jehovah and for our neighbor.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> So, all publishers, take advantage of all opportunities to learn the best ways to serve Jehovah. Then show true understanding by applying your knowledge in the field. Do not stop at just planting, but through back-calls and Bible studies water and cultivate the seeds sown. So doing, you will take your place with those who are bearing fruit manyfold.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Preaching on Board Ships</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In many coastal cities and seaports throughout the world a splendid opportunity for spreading the Kingdom message is afforded by visiting the ships from many nations which dock to unload cargo and passengers. Many of the men employed in the merchant marine of the world are eager for the opportunity to read and study the truth during their long days at sea traveling from one port to another. As they bring the literature they receive on their travels to their homes in distant lands the seed of truth has further opportunity to sprout and grow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Usually it is not difficult to obtain permission to board the ships and to witness and place literature with the crews. A courteous explanation of your work and mission to the gate watchman for the dock and also to the guard at the gangway of the ship is sufficient in most cases to gain permission to enter. You can explain that you are a minister of the gospel and that you are engaged in an international Bible educational work. Your purpose in calling is to give the crew the opportunity to obtain Bibles and Bible literature and to invite them to attend a public Bible lecture while they are in port. A brief witness is sufficient in most cases. Where the company operating the ship requires a pass before entrance is permitted, the watchman or ship’s agent can tell you how to get it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In some cases it is necessary to ask for the chief officer of the ship and explain the work to him before the publishers will be permitted to witness to others on the ship. However, where the minister is freely permitted to board it is best to call on the crew in their cabins and then work up to the ship’s officers, finishing with the captain. If members of the crew who are approached are on duty, the publisher should use discretion so as not to interfere with the necessary operations on board ship. For the most part it is possible to call from one cabin to the next just as though working from door to door in an apartment building, introducing yourself and presenting the offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Much good has been accqm-plished by brothers’ witnessing on board ships while in dock, but it is a field which has not been regularly covered. Publishers visiting the ships will find it necessary to carry a good supply of bound books in various languages, depending on the nationality of the ships in port. When someone shows interest in the message it is good to suggest that it will be possible for him to meet with Jehovah’s witnesses again during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col.</span><span class="font4"> 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In a world filled with false religion, how fortunate and privileged are the enlightened and true worshipers of the Almighty God, Jehovah. God’s kingdom is the only source of hope in this fading, gloomy old world, and sincere worshipers of Jehovah realize it.

<p><span class="font4">Honest labor brings forth good fruit. Jehovah’s servants have proved this to be true by the consistent increase of Kingdom proclaimed year after year. We are now in a new service year, which means that we will work for a new quota of publishers. The United States goal for 1952 is attaining a 10 per cent increase in average number of publishers, or 130,308 ministers of the true religion on an average witnessing in the field each month. The quota is based upon the average number of publishers for the year just completed, plus 10 per cent.</span></p>

And what a wonderful new instrument Jehovah has given us, to show to all the world what both false and true religion have done for mankind I The new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> will be presented to the public in December, for the first time. Along with this a premium booklet (any of which you have a good quantity) will be placed, on a contribution of 50 cents.

Present it to everyone with conviction and enthusiasm such as you have for Jehovah’s praiseworthy rule as King.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study conductor has a serious yet pleasant responsibility. He enjoys the privilege of directing the study so that the spiritual food the Lord regularly provides through the channel of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine is properly and understandably served to Jehovah’s servants. This he does by conducting an orderly and systematic question-and-answer discussion of the contents </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. The material studied will be according to the schedule appearing in the magazine.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> For this study to be lively and interesting, the conductor should thoroughly study and prepare his lesson in advance. He will thus be able to see that the main points </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the lesson are covered, make sure that correct thoughts are expressed in harmony with the paragraphs, and be certain that the study is timed to stay within the allotted hour.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> If the appointed conductor is unable to be present to conduct the study, it will be necessary for him to arrange for some capable brother to substitute for him. He will select competent brothers to read the paragraphs, and will use a different brother each week, where such are available, notifying them of their assignment at least one week in advance. (1 Cor. 14:19) As conductor, he will read the questions on the paragraphs, and then call on as many holding up their hands to express a comment as time will per-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">Many companies are ordering the book “Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> These are temporarily out of stock due to our presses being fully occupied with the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> However, 150,000 of these are in the company stockrooms in the U. S. Hence companies desiring </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> should contact nearby companies to obtain their needs. Circuit servants noting companies with -excess stock of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> should advise other<sup>-</sup> companies that are out of stock so they may obtain some.

He should endeavor to have as many different -publishers as possible comment during the study. Timid publishers can be encouraged to participate by assigning them scriptures cited in the lesson which they can read and comment on when time permits. The conductor may also make comments on any of the paragraphs where a vital point has been missed. However, these comments should be required only occasionally, and should always be brief. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization,</span><span class="font4"> paragraphs 131-134, for additional information.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> When new ones comment during the study, the conductor should try to contact these publishers after the meeting and express his appreciation of their comments, and encourage them to give further comments at succeeding studies. A real effort should be made by the conductor to make all persons in attendance feel welcome and to feel free to participate in the study. At the close of the meeting, brief announcements relative to field service and company study activity may be made by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">conductor or the company servant.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study conductor will faithfully fulfill his responsibility and privilege of making certain that the brothers are properly served “food at the proper time&quot;. In addition, he will set a right example by diligently applying himself to feeding persons of good will in field service regularly.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Fills Great Need</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> People everywhere are seeking success, but, outside of the truth, they have great difficulty in deciding what constitutes success. To them success means the gratification of some selfish desire of their own without any thought of what their personal success may cost someone else. But meditation upon and observance of the divine Word and law of Jehovah lead to “good success”.—Josh. 1: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Pointing the way to “good success” is the mission of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">magazine. Recognizing this, in October we will enthusiastically present to the people a one-year subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> in any one of twelve languages, with a premium of three booklets, on the contribution of $1.00.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota and Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> We are now printing over 870,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> each issue; but, with each one of us meeting the regular subscription quota of one for each publisher and four for each pioneer, its circulation should easily run over the million mark. Think of the expanded witness this would give! Is it not worth it? You know it is. Then let each one of us conscientiously give our all to this witnessing campaign, in order to attain our goal. Be ready to take subscriptions in the store-to-store and street work, on magazine routes, from house to house and on ba,ck-calls and Bible studies; and don’t forget your neighbors and friends. All over, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> can fill a great need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Present “Awakel”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The path of the world points to anything but the Bible. Rather it leads mankind away from “good success”. Of the magazines on the newsstands, none meets the critical need of the people in this day of crisis. All paint a dark picture without hope. In sharp contrast </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">is not religiously pessimistic. It is realistic and optimistic. True, it exposes the corruption of this present wicked system of things, but, even more important, it presents irrefutable proof of Jehovah’s righteous panacea for all this world’s ills by announcing the destruction and clearing away of all wickedness and the ushering in of a new world of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font4"> is not just another magazine but one that the people need. It is outstandingly different, presenting untarnished facts and not catering to the lustful propaganda desires of the public to stimulate sales. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> presents to the people the real issues of the day and points to the sure way of “good success” by ending each article with a word of comfort and hope. It is interesting, instructive and truthful, and maintains a high standard of integrity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> At each service meeting attention should be directed to the current offer as well as the weekly service schedule. Arrange to have lively demonstrations so that all may be stirred to present </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> Use selections from the magazines to show how the contents may be used to best advantage. Experiences may be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Have you made final arrangements to attend the Washington, D.C., convention? If you have not, you stand to miss what promises to be one of the most blessed assemblies to date. Here is the one grand opportunity to enjoy the unforgettable program presented to the publishers across the ocean. Be sure to be there if at all possible. You will have the chance to hear the same stirring messages that thrilled those attending the conventions held abroad, and this from the lips of the brothers who served on the program, and</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Change on Book Rate</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the rising costs of materials that go into bound books, it seems advisable to increase the rate of contribution to 50 cents a volume. Beginning December 1, 1951, all bound books will be placed with the public at 50 cents a copy (or half of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription rate set by the Society). The company rate on all bound books will be* 45 cents and the pioneer rate will be twice the present cost for books used as campaign literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All orders invoiced by the Society after November 1, 1951, will be at the new price. There will be no increase in prices of stock on hand held by companies or pioneers. After December 1, whatever stock is on hand will be placed at the new rate. No other changes in prices should be made, on either magazines or booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Book Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The regular edition of the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> is ready for delivery, and the new rate, as shown above, will apply to it from the very beginning of shipment from Brooklyn. During the month of December, the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> and a booklet will be used as the offer, on a contribution of 50 cents. Order your needed supply immediately. (Any booklet of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

You will hear the widely acclaimed public talk “Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?” delivered by Brother Knorr, who will be present at Washington, D.C., to deliver it in person. Reports indicate that there will be good representation from all states at this national convention. Make all the necessary plans so you can be there too. You’ll never regret attending this assembly; but you certainly will if you miss it. Ask the ones who </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Thousands of handbills, placards and window signs are ready, and something new—colorful lapel cards, just like the ones used at the London international convention, which were such a success in advertising the public lecture in the Wembley Stadium—will be there for your use. Hundreds of car cards will be displayed in the public transit buses and streetcars.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Parking space will be very limited. Although there will be some street parking in the general vicinity of the stadium, this too is limited. While traveling to and from assemblies and while at the assembly city it is always the best and safest practice to refrain from leaving any articles or valuables lying visible on the inside of one’s car, because of the risk of having thieves break in and steal them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Since the hotel rooms are inadequate to take care of all the brothers requesting such accommodations, some may be assigned to private homes. If you receive such an assignment, please accept it and bear in mind that a much greater witness can be accomplished in the homes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It may be impossible to provide outlets for sound recorders or, at best, provide them for only a limited number. Therefore, please write Watchtower Convention, Sound Information, at 817 A Street NE.. Washington 2, D.C., for verification before taking your equipment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Experienced musicians may bring their musical instruments with them. Songbooks should also be brought by all. Send in your room request at once if you have not already done so. If there is not sufficient time to get it back in the mail before you leave, send it in anyway; then call for it at the rooming department when you arrive. Everything is ready for you to attend the Washington convention. Listen to the assembly call and ATTEND!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Through Bible Tracts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part One)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Competing with this fast-moving atomic age. the Christian servant at times finds himself faced with a problem: people generally are in a despondent condition and need comfort and assistance and yet, too often, they think that they are so busy they have no time to listen to the message. Realizing the importance of making known the good news of the Kingdom to everyone, he fervently and zealously<sup>7</sup> strives to fulfill his commission from the Lord. But how is he to overcome the obstacle and present the message to the countless numbers who are so engrossed in this system of things that they<sup>7</sup> continually give the excuse, “Sorry, but I am busy”? At the London convention the Society released something that will aid toward solving this particular problem : four fact-presenting, questionanswering Bible tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just think! A complete witness on “What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?” “Hell Fire,” “Jehovah’s Witnesses, Communists or Christians?” and “Awake from Sleep!” The question now comes to mind, How should these tracts be presented?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being efficient ministers we will at all times consider the purpose of the tract. It was designed to give a witness by personal contact. The tracts are not to be slipped under the doors or left on the seats of buses, trains or other means of public transportation. When someone says “I am busy”, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> tract or two may<sup>7</sup> provide the brief witness that is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not hand out the tracts as you would a handbill. Nor are they for house-to-house distribution regardless of whether people are home or not. At all times strive to make a personal presentation. The tract is not to be left with the person of good will and then forgotten. Follow this up with a back-call. The contents reveal thought-provoking information and may lead to the placing of a bound book, further questions on the subject or the opportunity to give a verbal witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We should at all times handle the tracts carefully, realizing that they<sup>7 </sup>curl at the ends and soil easily. Avoid folding or crushing them. Make certain that those we present to the people are attractive to the eye as well as the mind. Perhaps a small folder can be used to hold them in the pocket or handbag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are a variety of opportunities that provide an opening for the use of the tracts. By carrying the tracts with us at all times, we will be equipped to give a witness under any circumstance. We can use them while talking to a friend or a relative or a businessman. In striking up a conversation with a stranger on the street or the friendly companion on the Ims. the opportunity may present itself to make known the Kingdom hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So make known tiie good news with confidence that your territory<sup>7 </sup>can be more easily covered with the new and colorful tracts. Keep pace with this fast-moving system of things by<sup>7</sup> letting those you come in contact with hear of Jehovah’s purposes and of the coming destruction on this rebellious world. By conscientiously<sup>7</sup> applying ourselves in presenting the tracts we will have many opportunities to further the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society is ready to fill company orders for tracts, and you may begin using them as soon as you receive them. In ordering the tracts please note the one desired and indicate by<sup>7</sup> the corresponding symbol: T1—“What Do Jehovah's Witnesses Believe?&quot; T2—“Hell Fire,” T.‘!—“Jehovah’s Witnesses, Communists or Christians?&quot; T4—“Awake from Sleep!&quot; All orders should be in lots of 250. The prices on the tracts will be: 75 cents a thousand; 40 cents for 500, 25 cents for 250. There will be no reduced pioneer rate. They are to be given away free by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After supplies of the tracts are received, 15 minutes in each service meeting for four weeks may be spent in considering each of the tracts. Discuss a different tract each week, showing how to make further use of them as a means of advertising and arousing interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Studies in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This book may<sup>7</sup> De studied at the company<sup>7</sup> book study as soon as the group finishes the book it is studying at the present time and when publishers have received their personal copies of the new book.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports indicate that although there is an increase in publishers throughout the country, yet there is no corresponding increase in book placements. It is the placing of books that furnishes one of the best bases for back-calls and home Bible studies. Therefore, to assist in overcoming this weakness in book placements, the following demonstration should aid the publishers to make their presentations more effective and enable them to devote more time in the field service, especially in the house-to-house activity.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE ONE: The ,company servant and assistant company servant are on the platform discussing the report of the company activity. (8 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The company servant Inquires of his assistant what an analysis of the Publisher’s Record cards reveals. The assistant explains that the book placements are low and notes the need for improvement. He also shows how the other features of activity, such as back-calls and home Bible studies, have suffered and suggests that an increase in book placements would make way for increases in these important features of activity. Many times the book placements average less than the number of publishers, and it can be shown that it is usually a minority of the publishers who make most of the book placements. (Base your discussion on analysis of Publisher’s Record cards.) Low hours of field service can also be emphasized as a contributing factor as well as the little amount of time spent in house-to-house activity. To remedy these weaknesses the company servant and his assistant decide to arrange for an interview of a few publishers who have been successful in their book placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE TWO: An interview of publishers is conducted on the platform by either the company servant or his assistant. (8 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A number of brothers and sisters are interviewed to relate how they have been successful in their book placements. They can either demonstrate or explain how they present the books to the householders and illustrate how their presentations are varied with different persons to insure successful book placements. They can also show how these placements are followed up by making back-calls, pointing to some of their home Bible studies as a result of following up book placements. Likewise it can be shown how they devote a good portion of their time in house-to-house activity, rather than perhaps spending all their time in other features of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE THREE: Sunday morning out in the field service. (4 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A publisher is just finishing witnessing to a householder and places a book. The name of the householder is obtained, and the conversation closes with the householder agreeing to a return visit by the publisher. The publisher notes the householder's name and address and the book placement on his House-to-House Record form. As he looks up, he is happily greeted by two other publishers who in times past had spent most of their time in other features of activity. They joyfully tell of their successful placement of books and the good experiences ehjoyed in witnessing to the people. With this, they express their intention of continuing to put more time in house-to-house activity. They express their gratitude for being encouraged to put more time in house-to-house activity and the blessing received from the Lord for doing so.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

<p><span class="font4">which you have an excessive supply may be used.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you do not have ample booklets in stock or are unable to obtain some from a nearby company that is overstocked and you wish to order booklets from the Society, then you may consult the August 1951 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> as to which booklets are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklet Paper Shortage</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?</span><span class="font4"> released in London, will not be stocked for campaign use, due to shortage of newsprint paper. Only a limited supply of this new booklet is on hand for the publishers who wish a personal copy. Hence, if any company wishes to order copies of the new booklet, please be governed by the above circumstances.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Reporting Home Bible Studies and Public Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Some servants and pioneers are having difficulty in correctly reporting their home Bible studies. As a result reports containing mistakes are sent to the Society. It is not difficult to report correctly if instructions are followed. Do not report the number of times you conduct studies during the month as the “Number of Home Bible Studies”. What is required is the number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font4"> studies held. Before filling out your report stop and ask yourself: “In how many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font4"> homes did I conduct studies during the month?” If you were in five different homes then report five. Do not report twenty studies just because you held a study four times in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">each </span><span class="font4">of the five homes during the month. However, each time you conduct a study, report it as a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning public meetings: This column on the pioneer report card is to be used only by pioneers holding isolated territory. The pioneer who sponsors any public meeting in such isolated territory where the public is invited and a discourse is given should report such meeting. A pioneer who gives a discourse at a meeting sponsored by a company should not report the meeting, since that is to be reported by the company. Also, pioneers who advertise and attend such company-sponsored meetings should not report them. All public meetings in company territory are to be reported by the company, including funerals and meetings conducted by circuit servants. Consult </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization</span><span class="font4"> for further information on reporting properly.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Tract Experiences</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Joyful over the prospect of using the new tracts, released in London, undoubtedly many publishers will be blessed with interesting and educational experiences. These experiences may prove to be helpful in aiding our fellow publishers. Any sound and helpful experiences pertaining to the use of and distribution of the tracts may be sent to the Society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah has been very gracious to us. He has given us knowledge and enlightenment through his visible organization. The reading of the Society’s bound books gave us our fundamental knowledge of the truth.

<p><span class="font4">To welcome persons of good will and make them feel more at ease, and to acquaint them with true Christian hospitality, the Society is printing Public Meeting Welcome slips (C-29). These are to be given out before the public lecture to good-will persons and strangers. When circuit servants order programs for the circuit assemblies they should order these welcome slips at the same time. They are to be used at circuit and district assemblies. Estimates on the number required can be determined by ordering (1) enough programs to supply only the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">publishers </span><span class="font4">attending the assembly and (2) enough welcome slips to supply the number of good-will persons and strangers anticipated. The Assembly Good-Will Follow-up slip (C-63) will continue to be used by the publishers when finding interest. Companies should, review this information just prior to their circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">know what our publications contain. Become familiar with these study aids and, with strong conviction and sincerity, use them effectively in preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In order to bear fruit manyfold, we must prepare an enthusiastic and convincing presentation of the books, and then ‘buy out opportune time’ to spend In Jehovah’s service. Engage in house-to-house work, call on the “not at homes” and endeavor to share in all other features of the ministry. Remember also to make return calls on those who obtained the books and help them to “get understanding” of the way that leads to life. Strive always to excel in your service to God, and thus you will be truly bearing fruit manyfold from right soil—Matt. 13: 23, A<sup>r</sup>W'.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The school servant occupies a unique position in the company. Into his hand has been committed the responsibility of training the brothers in public speaking, and both the brothers and the sisters in their oral presentations. By setting an enthusiastic, energetic pace for himself, he sets a good example for those whom he is trying to assist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The school servant should take an active, personal interest in the students. His job is not just to assign them talks and then counsel their presentation in the school. He should give them personal assistance and instruction in preparing and delivering their talks. The students should appreciate that the school servant is their servant and should not hesitate to ask him for needed help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Time should be spent by the school servant in preparing for the school. Not only should he be familiar with the lesson, but he should -also be prepared in advance for his counsel. This can be done by keeping a duplicate counsel sheet or a record for each student. So doing, the school servant can be familiar with the points on which the students are likely to be weak and can look up appropriate lessons in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers,</span><span class="font4"> noting constructive counsel and suggesting that the student also study those chapters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Counsel should not exceed two minutes. The instructor can thus limit himself by discussing only one or two good points and one or</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Tax Exemptions on Kingdom Halls</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Companies that rent halls are not entitled to tax exemption on the real property. Since the building is not a church and the owner receives rent, he must pay taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Companies that own their Kingdom Hall are entitled to exemption from paying taxes under the state constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is notice to any company that owns its Kingdom Hall and has been paying taxes on it to write to the legal office of the Society as to the amount of taxes paid and the date of the payment of taxes each year, and instructions will be sent as to the procedure for obtaining </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tax</span><span class="font4"> exemption. Address your letter to Watchtower Society, Legal Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">two weak points. He will still have sufficient opportunity to give con structive suggestions for overcoming weaknesses and for showing practical application of the good points.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The present arrangement of the school, allowing one minute to present important points omitted by the student speakers on the Bible chapters, offers the sisters a grand opportunity to have a greater share in its blessings. (This, however, does not apply to the chain word talks.) Of course, participation in the discussion requires advance preparation. But preparing the lesson on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> is not ‘wearisome for the flesh’. In fact, those who do little advance preparation have no idea of the thrill they are missing in discovering for themselves clearer renditions of scriptures that were previously hard to understand, more powerfully worded scriptures for use in the field, and eye-opening chains on subjects that were previously puzzling. If you are doubtful about how to study the lesson, ask the school servant for assistance, whether you are a brother or a sister, enrolled or not enrolled. Do not deny yourself , this fascinating and beneficial personal study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The school servant should be a constant example to the publishers, as all servants should be. He too must set an example of faithful field service, assisting publishers to use well their ministry training. The better the example he sets in the school and in the field, the greater will be his joy in assisting his brothers in the way of success.</span></p></li></ul>

The poor suffer while the greed of the rich continues to grow and threatens to wreck the whole tottering system of this old world. In this system, although no part of it, are an everincreasing number who have learned the folly of placing their trust in the riches of this world and have learned the secret of storing up riches in heaven.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Counsel on School Procedure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The following counsel is given to clarify the procedure in the theocratic ministry school so that all will get the most out of our study of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font5"> First of all, what is the procedure to be followed in a company composed of sisters? The sister appointed as company servant or school servant will handle the meeting by assigning someone to prepare the instruction talk material in advance, then during the school session to read aloud and briefly discuss it. To consider the assigned pages of the Bible text, the one in charge of the school will call for the sisters to point out what they have found of analytical value in the week’s assignment. A sister may comment on several verses for a few minutes, and as many as desire making to get last year’s subscribers to renew their subscriptions? Systematic arrangements should be made to call back upon as many of these subscribers as possible. Companies have these listed on the S-10 Subscription Record Sheets kept by the accounts servant. Help these to continue to gain riches of God’s wisdom and knowledge as made plain in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Magazine Day witnessing, as well as the other methods of offering “the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name”, provides the necessary ways to demonstrate that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer </span><span class="font5">is a vigilant guide to the new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> March brings the Memorial season. For the servants of the Lord this means not only the celebration of the Lord's death and the reason therefor, but the joyous hailing of him as the living, reigning King. The Memorial comes on Friday, March 23. Some may have their service meeting on Friday evening, but it is suggested that the service meeting for this week be planned for Thursday or some other day in the week so that it does not interfere with the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">The chain reference word may be handled by one sister taking up the whole chain consecutively, going from text to text as on a back-call, or the one in charge of the school may assign in advance a certain text or texts in the chain to each person. Then at the school they will read their assigned texts and discuss them. All counsel should be on the material, merely bringing out any points missed; no counsel will be given on delivery. No sisters will be enrolled, and they will remain in</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Every subscriber for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is entitled to receive each issue of the magazine, and it is the privilege of the,publisher obtaining the subscription to see that he does. However, not all are properly caring for this matter, for during January, 1951, 8,514 undelivered magazines were returned to the Society (at the cost of 2c each, or $170). The reasons given were “Moved, left no address”, “Not found,” &quot;Refused,” “No such address,” “Returned for better address,” etc. Many complaints, much delay and needless expense can be prevented if all publishers make sure that the name and address on every subscription slip is correct. The Society cuts the address stencil according to what appears on the subscription slip. Hence, make certain that the slip shows all the desired information. If the subscriber wants the designation Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., or other title before his or her name, be sure the subscription slip shows this. Accounts servants should also check all entries, and, if they are not correct or legible, make the necessary corrections on the subscription slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers, call back regularly on each new subscriber in order to guarantee receipt of the magazines. Be sure that a Change of Address form (S-20) is sent in for each subscriber who intends to move or has recently moved. Whenever writing regarding a subscription send along the latest address label.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For subscriptions in languages other than English, print the desired language ,in the upper righthand corner of the subscription slip. It takes two months to begin delivery of subscriptions for magazines in languages printed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the United States. Advise new subscribers of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With each one applying the above counsel, delivery of magazines will be insured, much time and money will be saved, and, most important, the “other sheep” will regularly receive the good news to which they ■are entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Be Rich in Right Works” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(C ant'd) </span><span class="font5">Memorial celebration. This service meeting should stress the importance of attending the Memorial, bringing people of good will to this celebration and highlighting the field-service arrangements for the week end. Every effort should be put forth to aid those attending the Memorial celebration to participate in field service. Demonstrations along this line may be planned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Wherever possible a capable anointed brother should be assigned to deliver the Memorial discourse. He should prepare his talk well, using the new outline and the information appearing in the January 15 issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> At the conclusion of his talk, he should include pointed information about the importance of ‘being rich in right works’ by joining in with Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. The speaker or the chairman of the meeting can announce the arrangements for service during the week end to follow and invite all present to share in announcing the reigning King. The number attending and the number who partook of the emblems should be reported to the Society by the company servant, on the card supplied by the Society for this purpose.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Advancing Toward 34 Per Cent</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> With each one accepting his full share of the load, it is believed that a peak can be reached in March and the groundwork laid for a further peak In April. The service year is now half gone, so we want to make good strides toward reaching the 34 percent increase in the peak number of publishers. In fact, we should come close to meeting this desired goal by the end of March. This will be assured if we keep in mind the individual requirement as outlined in the January 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font5"> “Aid another creature to understand God’s purposes, help him in going out in the work, grounding him well in the truth, and letting him see his privilege of being a minister of the Most High.” The other suggestions outlined in this issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> should be heeded. This will take patience and hard work, but the joy received in helping others become “rich in right works” will certainly offset any hardships encountered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah has decreed that greedy and oppressive men shall die. “So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” But to those that love him and work diligently to store up treasure in heaven by “right works”, everlasting life is assured.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>On Back-Calls</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To fulfill our commission to “make disciples of people of all the nations” we must make effective back-calls. Our return visits should be with a purpose; each eall should be a theocratic lesson w here a point that will stimulate further Interest Is forcefully brought home. Consequently, we must be prepared. How to break through their outer shell and rekindle the spark of Interest noted on our first visit is a major problem for many publishers. The tendency of many is to abruptly bring up an issue immediately after their “good morning” and try to tell all the truth they know in the first breath. However, first, try to put the householder at ease by speaking unhurriedly, calmly and conversationally. Ask a few friendly questions and then tactfully guide the conversation into a Kingdom witness. For instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Good evening, sir. How are you? I’m very glad you’re in this evening, as I’ve been wanting to talk to you about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to which you subscribed last month. You’ve already begun receiving it in the mail, you say? Very good. I’m sorry that you haven’t had the chance to read it, but I realize that there's so little time; we’re all so busy. But say! You know, I was reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> last night and I read something that I’m sure will appeal to you. Remember on my last visit we discussed about orthodox religion’s failure as a peacemaker despite their prayers for peace, and you didn’t quite agree? Well, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> made an interesting observation on that point. Would you get your copy? . . .” From there proceed to develop your testimony and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">School Procedure </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd) </span><span class="font5">their seats when considering their assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chain talks in all schools are to be handled progressively, otherwise the chain is of no value. The purpose of the chain is to enable the brothers to locate a particular word or subject and follow it through the Bible without having a lot of notes, just as you would do on a back-call. The chain word or expression should be the theme, and as the student comes to each text he will show how the word applies. Do not group the texts together except where there are too 2 answer the question to their satisfaction. You might let the conversation lead into another issue, but tactfully suggest it be reserved for next week’s discussion as you have another call, or for some other reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only is making the initial back-call a major step, but keeping it alive and interesting after months of regular calling is important, if your back-calls are to progress and develop. To avoid their becoming “dead” material, so to speak, begin early </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> train them to be “disciples”. You know they will have questions. Hence, “be ready always to give an answer” by taking a few minutes before or after your study to explain the functions of the organization and other matters. Arouse their interest in the different meetings held at the Kingdom Hall and tell them what they are for. From time to time take along another publisher with you so that when they do attend they will not feel like strangers. Relate an interesting demonstration from your service meeting program, discuss a scripture made clearer by the study of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW</span><span class="font5"> at the ministry school, go over portions of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> calling their attention to the various comments made at the company study’. Also, looking forward to their becoming “disciples”, tell them of your field service experiences. Live the truth in every way and make them want to follow your good example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this will make your back-calls alive, interesting and progressive. Continue to make “disciples of people of all the nations” by systematically teaching and presenting the good news on back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">many texts in the chain to cover in the allotted time. Do not jump around but handle the chain references CONSECUTIVELY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Counsel given the student speakers should be on delivery, timing, preparation and analytical coverage. The Speech Counsel sheet is to be used as heretofore. Youths enrolled in the school should be given their opportunity to talk. Parents, the school servant, or any other capable person may help them prepare their talks. With all participating in the theocratic ministry school and then following through by applying the knowledge gained, a more effective witness will be given, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This month’s demonstration is to contrast the wrong way with the right way of aiding Irregular publishers. Caution should be exercised, however, that a demonstration of this type does not become so extreme as to be absurd. Such absurdity minimizes the total purpose and effect of the demonstration. These demonstrations need not be elaborate, but should be practical and instructive so that they will definitely assist all to be better ministers. This is simply a sample or model. You are not limited to only the suggestions in this column, but use your imagination and develop demonstrations as required throughout the month.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: The “Watchtower” study has Just adjourned and a regular publisher approaches an irregular publisher, asks him to sit down for a moment and then begins to talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The regular publisher can take‘an attitude like that of a father to a child. He can then explain, calmly, but not too tactfully, how he has come short in field service, and how such course will lead to his destruction, and that he must participate in all features of service and put in lots of time. Wrong features to expose should be: waiting till he was at the meeting to contact him, taking a “holier than you” attitude, being tactless, and not making definite arrangements to assist him in service. (This part should be very brief. The emphasis is to be on the right way.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: A regular publisher is making a friendly call on an irregular publisher. As the scene opens in the living room of the irregular publisher, the regular publisher is tactfully changing the subject from one of world news to the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this scene it should be comparatively easy to switch the subject from world news to an experience in the field service. After mentioning the experience, the regular publisher can casually ask if the irregular publisher has had any good experiences lately. He will reluctantly admit that he hasn’t been out for some time. The regular publisher will find out why. (Usually no real reason, sometimes just a little bit of fear) He should be sympathetic, and then show good Scriptural reason why it is important to put in all the time possible now. Then he can suggest that the irregular one assist him. He has a large territory that needs to be worked and he has so many back-calls that he cannot care for all of them. So he appeals to the irregular publisher for help. Aided by this loving appeal, the irregular publisher agrees to help him. So they make definite arrangements as to the day, time, place, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD SCENE: The two publishers are just arriving in their territory. This scene can show them making calls at two doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The regular publisher realizes that he must train up this fellow witness in the way he should go, so that when he is mature he will not depart from it. He knows the irregular publisher has not been in the field recently, that now he will be a bit timid, so he doesn’t send him off by himself but tactfully suggests that they make the first few calls together. At the first door the regular publisher gives a witness, briefly overcoming several objections, such as: “I’m not interested,” “Well, I have my Bible,” and “I’m just too busy”. Afterward the irregular publisher decides to make the next call by himself. He tries to give a good witness and overcomes the same objections and gains confidence. As the two go home after a long day, the irregular publisher is happy because he has preached the Word to others and now he is determined to go out regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The grand total of new subscriptions sent in by all branches during January, 1951, was 51,192. It is very good to note that of these, 5,331 are in the Spanish language. The campaign is off to a good start, for this is an increase of 8,831 subscriptions over January, 1950. With each company publisher and pioneer diligently striving to meet or exceed his quota, this campaign should prove to be the greatest yet. Keep up the fine work!</span></p>

These applications should be renewed annually by written request. The Society should also be notified of any change in information as to qualifications for work, health, draft classification and address.

<p><span class="font5">Interest in the European conventions this summer is mounting throughout the United States, as indicated by the number of inquiries received concerning the assemblies in London and Paris. It is anticipated that travel to Europe this summer will be extremely heavy. Therefore, the sooner you definitely decide on what you are going to do, the more certain you will be of obtaining suitable travel accommodations. Those going by boat should make their reservations just as soon as possible. The Society will try to charter some airplanes for the trip and those delegates interested in this transportation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">should report to the Society soon.</span><span class="font5"> Address such mail to: London Convention Desk, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for incidental expenses in Europe: Be prepared to pay prices equivalent to prevailing prices here in the United States for food, lodging, travel, etc. Your travel to past conventions in the United States will help you in arranging your budget for the trip to Europe. The Society will soon publish the addresses of the rooming committees in the European convention cities and give instructions on reserving rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An early decision will be to your advantage. If you </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font5"> you are going to the London assembly or if you are going to stay in Europe for three or four weeks, write immediately for further information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The assistant company servant should be the one best fitted to take oversight of the company’s Kingdom interests in the absence of the company servant. To be thus qualified it is necessary for him to co-operate closely with the company servant in all service matters. Not only will he assist in planning the service activities of the company, but he will help in carrying them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is to tabulate the field service report each week and post it on the Company Progressive Report sheet, as well as keep the Publisher’s Record cards and company chart right up to date. All records should be accurate, complete, neat and always available for use at company meetings. At the end of the month the Bible Study Reports are received by him for counting and posting on the Publisher's Record cards; after which they are turned over to the Bible study servant. He will report to the company servant any weakness or trend in the company’s report noted by him as he handles it. This information will be of assistance to the company servant in planning the meetings and activity of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After compiling the month’s report he will supply the study conductors with a list of those who did not report during that month. All conductors, servants and publishers will then work together to help these persons into the service during the early part of the new month. He will be on the alert tp see that those</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">helped during the previous months are likewise receiving proper attention. On the 15th of the month the assistant company servant will supply the conductors with another list of those in their respective studies who have not yet reported that month. This will insure the greatest number of persons being helped into the service by the end of the month. Through such mutual assistance rendered, all will be knit more closely together and the preaching work will expand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The primary duty of any servant is to take the lead in field service activity. Therefore the work of the assistant company servant is not merely that of keeping the company’s records or doing a supervisory work, but he is to energetically assist the company servant to co-ordinate the activity of the brothers in aiding new and irregular publishers. He will engage in the different features of activity, setting an active example for those he helps into the service. The more personal attention all servants give individual publishers in service matters the greater the increase will be. Hence, he will make it a point to discuss the publishers’ service problems with them at the Kingdom Hall and when necessary call at their homes to aid them. The brothers will show their deep appreciation for this by greater co-operation in carrying out service arrangements and in aiding others themselves. Thus the company organization will be strengthened and grow to Jehovah’s honor and vindication.</span></p>

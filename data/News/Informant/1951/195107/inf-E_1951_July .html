<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Rural Work to Be Stressed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> With Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as their teachers, Jehovah’s witnesses have received fine instruction in the way of life. They have learned the elementary doctrines of Christian principles, they have been enlightened on the issue of universal domination, they know the Kingdom is now in operation, and they know that their chief obligation at this “time of the end” is to make known this good news to all the inhabited earth. The “feast of fat things” enjoyed at our recent district assemblies was part of our teaching and has helped to equip all of us to heed the admonition to “continue in the things you learned”. Only by so doing can the man of God become “fully competent” in teaching, reproving, and all good works.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5"> Tim. 3 : 14-17 ; 4 : 1, 2, .VW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> A ready instrument to assist us to continue dispensing the things we have learned will be featured during the months of July, August and September, namely, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God lie True’’ </span><span class="font5">together with a 32-page self-covered booklet, on a 35c contribution. This hook presents God’s side of the issue now before mankind. Many have already learned much from its pages. But there are a great many more who have not had that opportunity. So we want to search out these persons and aid them to get a basic knowledge of God's Word through this help. Then they, too, will be able to continue in things learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Cover Rural Sections</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> During July, weather conditions are very conducive to rural work. Many persons in our rural territories receive very little attention during the winter months, so we should use this opportunity to carry the things we have learned to them. Of course, we do not want to neglect our city territory completely. But we want to cover our rurals while the season is favorable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">«Public meetings have proved very successful in giving a witness in rural territories and in finding those who want to learn the truth. Locations for these lectures are comparatively easy to get. Why, public meetings can be held in fields, on lawns, on sun porches, in schoolyards and in various other places that can be had free or at a very reasonable cost. Once found, this rural interest should be regularly fed by starting home Bible studies, group studies or by letter writing when it is impossible to make personal visits. Let us take advantage of every circumstance and condition that offer us an opportunity to teach these honest ones, that they too may continue in the things they will have learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hold On to Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Many new publishers are now swelling our ranks. Also increasing by leaps and bounds is the number of good-will persons who associate with us. We want to aid all these</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Spend More Time in</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Make Your Time Count</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Now is the “opportune time” for men to take in and pass on to others knowledge of Jehovah, his Son and his kingdom. The time period allowed for this since 1914 is rapidly moving toward its end with the destruction of this wicked system of things. Hence, the remaining time is especially precious to all of Jehovah’s servants. As much consecrated time as possible must be spent in the ministry. Ours is a real stewardship, a life-saving ministry, the most important of all work! The sheep of the Lord must be found and fed, and a warning witness given! To do this, time is required. Time must be spent in preaching from house to house, holding forth the Kingdom message on the streets, making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies, and training new publishers to be effective ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>2</sup> More time devoted to field service will result in a greater witness </span><span class="font5">to continue in the things they are learning. What gain is there if we start a publisher in the service and on his way to Christian maturity, and then abandon him and let him lapse back into inactivity or even back into the world? Yes, we must assist him to continue in things learned until he is strong enough to move forward on his own. And we must assist those who have not yet entered into the service to continue in the things they have been learning by making public declaration of the good news. We can set an example for all by diligent study, regular attendance at meetings and regular service, and thus demonstrate how to continue in the things we learned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Now is not the time to droop our hands and rest on our laurels. Knowledge brings happiness and responsibility as well. If you would obtain Jehovah’s favor, “continue in the things you learned.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Field Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">and assure that the sheep will be found and cared for. Do not be content with minimum service. Strive to increase the amount of time you spend in field service. At least make an effort to reach and exceed your company’s individual quota of hours each month. Can you do more? Is your territory being properly worked? Are your back-calls made regularly? Does each publisher conduct at least one Bible study? Does everyone participate in Magazine Day activity? Are there new or weaker publishers that you can help? No, none can afford to relax and take it easy. The field is large and much is yet to be done. However, with each one putting forth effort, more will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Sacred Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> With careful planning it will be possible to utilize in field service time unnecessarily spent in other </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font5"> 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">More Time In Service </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font5">pursuits. Weights and hindrances must be cast off. For the theocratic minister it is not “How much can I crowd in on the ministry?” but, instead, “How many of these weights can I lay aside for the ministry?” Putting the Kingdom interests first will allow the most time for field service. Time and energy consumed in pursuit of illusive wealth, worldly entertainment, etc., are the things to be sacrificed in favor of time for the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> How can you make your time count while in the service? Strive for efficiency. Be well organized both as a company and individually. Get necessary literature and territory at the service meeting. Wherever possible, arrange your group beforehand for the week-end service. This will save valuable time when the group is to leave for the field. All will know where they are going. No time will be lost in indecision; publishers will be able to Immediately depart to the field. Also, efficiency at the doors will result if you have in mind what you intend to say in presenting the literature offer. Regardless of the number of hours you spend in the field, make them the best hours you can give. Jehovah’s service deserves it!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regularity Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Then, there is the matter of regularity. The most good is accomplished by a publisher who is regular in the service. Endeavor to be regular, engaging in the service some time each week. Schedule your affairs to do this. This will make possible the coverage of more territory, proper and regular care of interested persons, and will show your dependability. Such a regular example was set by the apostles, for “they continued without letup teaching apd declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus” —Acts 5: 42, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> After field service is done, report it. In this way all will know how 'much of the “opportune time” Is spent in the preaching work. Ours Is a great privilege to serve Jehovah. It is a good work. Therefore, we should face each day’s service with enthusiasm and a desire for the work; be joyful, happy to be used by Jehovah. He will not forget your work and the love you show for His name. Be industrious in the service. Resist any tendency to be sluggish. Instead, always have plenty to do in the work in connection with the Lord. Make your field service time count!—1 Cor. 15 : 58; Heb. 6:11,12, MK</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>To Those “Not Interested”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “I’m not interested.” How often the Kingdom publisher hears this remark when approaching the people with the Kingdom message! This presents a challenge, and in order to make sure that such persons do not willfully turn the minister of good news away without first knowing what he represents, it becomes the duty of each publisher to devise ways of overcoming this barrier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It is not a case of refusing to take “No” for an answer, but of being sure that the householder is not answering before he knows what the visit is about. Perhaps, in the mind of the householder you are just another salesman, or he may know you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses but his mind has been poisoned against the work because of misrepresentation. The need to ascertain why one is not interested is thus seen in order to know how to approach him and remove the objection. One might answer such a remark in this manner:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> “But surely you are Interested in the Bible, and that’s why I’m calling—to further acquaint you with the good things contained therein. You are interested in the security of your home and family. And no doubt world events, perplexing as they are, have caused you to wonder what chance there is for security and peace in the world. The Bible holds out a hope; and that is the purpose of my call, to point out the importance of gaining an understanding of the Bible and thus learn the way to gain God’s favor. If we</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Stimulating Sessions Spur Works of Praise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “The three days went by so quickly,” “So much wholesome instruction was given I” “The assembly has given me renewed determination,” “Certainly, these assemblies are Jehovah’s provision.” These are but a few of the many thousands of expressions made in appreciation of the eight recent district assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Yes, we have good reason to be grateful. Just review the timely instruction that we received. Much good counsel was given on Magazine Day activity, appreciating and using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> and how to reach and maintain our 34 per cent increase. Pioneering was have this, we can be certain of his protection and salvation. You want to learn about this, I'm sure; and to aid in this regard, I would like to show you this book which is a great aid in studying the Bible. Let me show you some of its features.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In the case of some who are prejudiced and have based their erroneous conclusions regarding Jehovah’s witnesses on false testimony, one might tactfully draw out the objector and find out why he does not like the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Frankly and sincerely ask him: “What is it about our work that you object to? I am very much interested in your opinion.” In this manner the sincere person will express himself, and an opportunity will be presented to tactfully refute the erroneous conclusions. Care should be taken to avoid closing the mind of the individual with dogmatic refutation. It is best to establish common ground immediately, and then as quickly as possible let him see that, despite all that he has heard about Jehovah’s witnesses and their beliefs, they are following the teachings of the Bible and are endeavoring to apply the principles of truth and righteousness contained therein. Honest persons will not object to this practice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The circumstances will always dictate how one shall proceed after he has taken the initial steps to overcome this particular objection. Hence, the publisher will need to be alert and be ever ready to help those with whom he comes in contact to grasp the truth and learn of Jehovah and his purposes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">shown to be the ideal life as we rapidly approach the new world. The information on divine healing and keeping the organization clean and wholly devoted to Jehovah’s service was deeply appreciated. Then, too, our responsibility as servants and publishers to maintain a blameless ministry was clearly outlined. Thus, with our minds braced up for activity, all of us together will push ahead faithfully In order to complete that tested quality of our faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The high point of each assembly was Sunday’s public lecture, “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land.” The combined attendance of the eight assemblies for this main event was 93,305.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal preparation and organization of one's own affairs is necessary to get the most out of the time and energy spent in Jehovah’s service. This is emphasized by the apostle Paul’s words recorded at 1 Corinthians 9: 26, NW, &quot;The way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.” The following demonstration is to show by contrast the need for personal advance preparation and organization in order to accomplish the most good while in the field service. Time: 15-20 minutes.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE ONE: In the home of a family of publishers. (4 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is Sunday morning and the parents are getting the children up to go into the field service. It is rather late, none seem to know where their literature eases are, the parents are scolding, all is in a state of confusion, no one seems to know where anything is, and each one expects the other to get it. They hastily try to get organized, find they have none of the latest literature, magazines, territory, etc., but decide to go out anyway, though poorly equipped, too late to meet the group, some without breakfast, and no consideration of the daily text, etc. Of course, under such circumstances they will not stay very long or accomplish much in territory coverage or give an effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE TWO: In a well-ordered home of publishers who believe In being prepared and ready for the service. (If </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">necessary, the same</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> publishers used </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Scene One may be used in this scene. 4 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is early evening before the service meeting. The parents have their children get their literature cases, and they proceed to make a list of the things they will need to get at the Kingdom Hall for the week-end service, such as a supply of latest magazines, current literature offer, a Bible for a back-call, report slips, house-to-house records, and check to see if they have enough territory, etc. Thus, with an eye on future service, they prepare in advance, so when Sunday morning comes they will be fully equipped for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE THREE: In the well-ordered home, early Sunday morning before leaving for the territory or group contact point. (7 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The family Is gathered together after breakfast, they are just concluding the discussion of the daily text. Then they proceed to prepare a testimony (under direction of the parents) that they can use in presenting the current literature offer. An appropriate paragraph in the book is selected for use in showing the people the value of the book as a Bible study aid. Thereafter, fully prepared, organized and with their literature cases and territory, all leave joyfully for the field service or contact point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">General Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all of this do not overdo the wrong way and lose the point of instruction, namely, personal organization and advance preparation for the field service. While the above demonstration illustrates a family scene, the points brought out should be such that they could apply to all publishers, and from which all can profit. By applying the above counsel, publishers will be in a better frame of mind to accomplish the ministry. They will be fully equipped, able to stay in the field longer without wasting valuable time. So doing all will be running in a “certain” manner, not striking the empty air with what could be telling blows in field service.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1951 District Assemblies </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’rl) </span><span class="font5">increase, to compare with 66,350 for 1948 and 85,441 for 1949. Also, 2,006 persons symbolized by baptism the dedication of their lives to Jehovah’s service. (Servants, remember to post this baptism date on the Publisher’s Record card of those publishers baptized.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Not only Jehovah’s witnesses were served by these assemblies, but many additional persons of good will were witnessed to by publishers en route to and from the assemblies, and more especially in the assembly cities. Now that this interest has been found, we must diligently care for it by calling back soon and starting home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> To the extent that we apply the sound counsel received at these assemblies, we will show our appreciation to Jehovah for this grand provision of his. With grateful hearts and renewed strength received from these tine assemblies, all publishers are determined to steadfastly press on with the work of ‘proclaiming liberty throughout ail the land’ in their respective home territories.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Share in August’s Activity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The woeful cry of the people today Is for life. How are they to find It? If the declaration of Jehovah holds true that “my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”, then the converse must be true, that the people will be saved and preserved alive by the possession of knowledge, life-giving knowledge of Jehovah God and of his Son Christ Jesus.—John 17: 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font5"> W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest service any man, woman or child could possibly render to humanity today is to dispense freely the knowledge of God and encourage all those who are “sighing and crying” to make a personal study of the Bible, the source of lifegiving knowledge. During August Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to serve people everywhere by offering the Bible study aid </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'‘Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and a self-covered booklet, on a 35c contribution. The weather this month continues to be favorable for working rural territory, so well-planned efforts should be made to really witness in such areas. With the groups starting early and taking lunch with them, a full day of service can be spent among people in these areas, serving them life-giving knowledge. Where possible, plan public meetings in conjunction with rural activity. Companies not having rural territory can concentrate on city territories needing attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many newly interested ones have acquired life-giving knowledge through a study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font5"> They are familiar with its contents, appreciate Its value and</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">are in position to tell others. Often all that is necessary for them to join in rendering sacred service is a loving and tactful invitation from you to engage in the service that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But to really serve people with life-giving knowledge means more than just placing a book. Keep a record of all placements so back-calls can be made, with the goal of starting studies in mind. If placements are made in isolated territories where it is difficult to call back, then when placing the book spend time to explain how they can study it themselves. With everyone following these suggestions the crying need of many individuals for life-giving knowledge will be satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> For the purpose of checking and auditing, the accounts servant will keep a “Hold file” and a Permanent file. Into the “Hold file” go all invoices, duplicate copies of remittance forms, Literature Credit Request forms, labels for magazines received and any other information you expect to appear on your statements. After all information is checked against your statements and found to be correct, then transfer such to the Permanent file, which is to contain all forms and statements relative to the company accounts. These will then be kept for seven years, in accordance with the Statute of Limitations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> At the end of each month all accounts are to be balanced, and money received for literature and magazines is to be sent to the Society, using the regular remittance form along with a covering check, money order or bank draft, etc. The accounts servant will not make payment on any bill unless it is first approved by the company servant. The company servant will check, sign and mail all remittances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Finally, the accounts servant is to make a report to the company on the condition of the company accounts at the first service meeting of each month. This report must be in writing and contain the standing of the Company Cash, Literature and Magazine Accounts, and must be signed by the accounts servant and put in the Permanent file. With the accounts servant thus diligently caring for his duties and working along with the rest of the servants and publishers, local Kingdom interests will be advanced, to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

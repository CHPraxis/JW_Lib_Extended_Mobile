<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah our Creator is all supreme. It follows that we as his creatures should obey him by subjecting ourselves to the doing of his will. We have no stupendous assignment, such as participating in cleaning up this present system of things or destroying those who refuse to conform to the new system coming in. No, that is His job, by decree. Our commissioned work is to preach while maintaining integrity. Right in the midst of the trembling and crumbling society of nations, we are commanded to preach the good news of the Kingdom in obedience to the “superior authorities”.—Romans 13:1, A H'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Work During May</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The work of Jehovah’s prudent slaves is not unfruitful. On the contrary, many are halting in their indecisive course and listening to the message of hope proclaimed. By word of mouth and by the printed page, they are instructed in the way of life. During May the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font4"> will be used effectively in this regard to instruct these sheep of the Lord. Chiefly from house to house and on back-calls, this publication along with a 32-page self-covered booklet will be offered to the people on the contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> While placing this book in the field, on back-calls and with those who recently subscribed to the magazines, keep in mind our main purpose in placing literature, that of using it to teach people of good will the truth. If they already have literature and do not desire to obtain the latest, then do not conclude that they are not interested. Use the publications that they have to instruct them. The literature is incidental and only instrumental in the over-all campaign of education for life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> It is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">district assembly</span><span class="font4"> time in the United States! From one end of the country to the oilier, east to west, north to south, tens of thousands, anticipating the assembly blessings, are eagerly planning and arranging to attend one of the eight conveniently located assemblies planned for this year. Are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font4"> one of the many thousands planning to attend? What a treat is in store for all who do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> For months Jehovah's ‘discreet slave class' has been making the preliminary and detailed arrangements necessary so that these assemblies will run smoothly and to the mutual benefit of all assembled. Spacious really no reason why these features of the service should lag, since ample provisions for their advancement have been made by the Lord’s organization. Service meetings instruct us in the most effective ways of conducting back-calls and home Bible studies; assimilating the meat in due season provided through the publications of the Society at meetings and in private study gives us sufficient knowledge to teach others; and on-the-spot training offered by the servants in the companies provides a means for personal instruction in the doing of this work. Do we have any excuse, then, for holding back from participating in these forms of the service? No ! These are the very essence of our work and are where the waters of Jehovah's Word of truth are dispensed so much more freely. By everyone's concentrating on back-call and home Bible study activity in May. by calling back on all who show interest, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page J<sub>h</sub> col. 1) </span><span class="font4">halls, as announced in the April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> have been obtained, assembly personnel organized, rooming work cared for, a delightful program arranged, etc., so that all attending will be well served. Do not hesitate to encourage those with whom you are studying and other good-will persons to attend. No doubt, in most instances, arrangements can be made to bring these interested ones. The information to be presented will be of interest to all. Bethel brothers will serve at each assembly, and specially prepared subjects of vital importance will be discussed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Do not forget to take along your witnessing case and your magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Six-Month Check-up</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Pioneers—Excel in Your Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The results of the six-month pioneer hour check-up covering September 1950 through February 1951 are heart wanning and definitely prove tfiat despite present critical times increasing numbers are joining the pioneer ranks and making a success of it. At the time of the check-up last February there were 4.553 pioneers on the list. This year there are 6,207. Of these, only two per cent had to be transferred to the company publisher ranks because of their reports and circumstances. Those who did not quite reach the minimum quota are being written individually respecting their pioneer activity, and they will be given until the end of the service year to make up lost time and reach the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneers, work to excel at the fulltime ministry! Do not be content with minimum service. Yours is a grand privilege, yet, a grave responsibility. Preach the good news, find the sheep, feed them and help them shoulder the load of responsibility that the knowledge of the truth brings. Serve your brothers, do good toward all, set the right kind of example that will cause others to glorify Jehovah. Put pioneering first at all times, always “keep watching the ministry which you accepted in the Lord, that you fulfill it”.—Col. 4: 17, A IF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Publishers, does not the steady growth in the pioneer ranks mean something to you? It is most convincing evidence that pioneering is a practical vocation. Additionally, the Scriptures abound with promise that Jehovah will provide for those who step out with faith into the fulltime ministry. Why put it off any longer? If you cannot be a pioneer the year round, perhaps you can be a vacation pioneer. This field is open at any time of the year for both youths and adults who can meet the pioneer requirements lor at least two months. Do not let the present “critical times hard to deal with&quot; prevent you from joining the ranks of full-time ministers now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So now is the favorable time and season to engage in full-time service. Prayerfully apply yourself now to do God's good will and pleasure while the opportunity to serve thus is open. Write to us for your application. We shall be happy to send you one immediately.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit and district assemblies are means that the Lord is using to assemble his people for vital Kingdom instruction so necessary during these last days. A great deal of time, money, and effort are spent in arranging and preparing assemblies and, for publishers to derive full benefit, they must properly prepare to attend and conduct themselves fittingly while there. The following material emphasizes proper publisher preparation, consideration for the landlady and conduct at the assembly. To cover this material as outlined, twenty to twenty-five minutes should be devoted to it at a service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: (Part one) By pantomime illustrate the basic steps each publisher should take in preparing for an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Publisher has Room Request form and is in the process of filling It out. Care is taken to supply all requested information, such as full name and address, type of room requested and amount desired to be paid, date of arrival and length of stay, etc. Upon completion it is recheeked and mailed. Receiving the rooming assignment a few days later, time is taken to write the landlady and confirm date of arrival and intended time of arrival. Next comes personal organization. Proper clothing is selected, appropriate literature, book and magazine bags are put in order, duties requiring one's attention before leaving are cared for. room assignment card is thoughtfully put in with those things to be carried to the assembly, such as songbook, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part two) Show arrival of publisher in assembly city at a reasonable hour on day before assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon arrival the publisher, with suitease and book bag, goes directly to assigned room, introduces himself in a friendly manner to the landlady, and is directed to his room. Showing consideration for the landlady and wanting to be fully rested so as to get the most from the next day's assembly schedule, the publisher retires for the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: Witnessing to the landlady. (Arrange as a demonstration.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many landladies are interested in Jehovah’s witnesses, want to know what kind of work we are doing, what we believe, etc., and open their homes to Jehovah's witnesses with this in mind. Understanding this, on the following evening the alert publisher utilizes an opportunity to witness. A program is produced, future assembly activity is highlighted, particularly the public meeting, and an offer is made to have the landlady and her household attend assembly sessions with the publisher. Continuing, the witness tells of an experience had in the field service there in the assembly city. The scene will end with the publisher leaving with the landlady the particular booklet, magazine or book which covers the point of discussion raised in the experience related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD SCENE: Forum discussion covering Christian conduct at an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two or three publishers should be assigned to cover I he following points, and in their discussion they should point out the benefits all receive by adhering to these principles: 1. Be on time for mid attend all sessions. 2. Show neighbor love by not talking and distracting others during the meetings. 3. Do not rudely leave sessions before being dismissed or while prayer is being said. 4. Visit before and after sessions (not during). 5. Volunteer for assembly work. (&gt;. Have a part in field service; help others attend. Turn in good-will slips and subscriptions at assembly city : field service reports to home company. 7. Arrive at your rooms at a reasonable hour each evening.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">that Isaiah instructed, “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Loim.” Baggy, impressed trousers, grimy, wrinkled shirts or dresses, or unshined shoes are no aid to us as we bear the Kingdom message. Though not necessarily fancy or expensive. clothing should always be neat and clean, befitting the message we bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Personal cleanliness is likewise important. An ambassador of the Theocracy will not <sub>(</sub> have unkempt hair, unshaven face or dirty hands. Such things nullify the good effects of the comforting words we speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By far the majority of the servants of God do observe the simple rules of cleanliness. But since people are prone to judge all by the one who may not. it is essential for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font4">to lie equally diligent in this important matter. We are called upon to reflect the light and glory of Jehovah. Neat appearance, clothes pressed, shoes shined reflect cleanness and enlightenment and confidence. Pause a moment each time before going into the service and ascertain if these things have been taken care of. It is a good investment to be clean. It will make your work doubly effective, and you will be conforming to the apostle's counsel. &quot;Giving no offence in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ann</span><span class="font4"> thing, that the ministry be not blamed.” —2 ('or.

In eight short months more than 2,009,1X10 copies of this book have been printed, shipped and most of them placed with the public.

<p><span class="font4">But to enable prospective “other sheep” to ‘call upon the name of Jehovah' according to his purposes means more than just placing a book. They must learn the pure language it contains. So continue to serve by calling back on every placement. Make a real effort to start a study, for through home Bible studies these honest-hearted ones will learn of Jehovah, his purposes, and how to worship and serve him. The mature servants and those just learning the pure language will together ‘call upon the name of Jehovah’ and serve him with one consent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Sometimes it is necessary<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> to settle matters in the company<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> upon which no specific instructions have been given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization.</span><span class="font4"> These matters must be decided upon by the company committee representing the congregation. The company<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> committee, comprised of the company servant, assistant company servant and the Bible study servant, has the responsibility of handling such matters in a systematic and orderlyway. Wherever possible, the committee should be composed of three different publishers, and should be the most mature in the company and tlie logical ones for the companyservant to consult when he needs advice or counsel on such matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The committee will consider and care for all incidental company matters such as the advisability of dividing the company<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> into units, how much rent should be paid for halls, what halls should be rented, what should be done with excess money, how much money should be spent on legal matters approved by the Society, how to minister spiritual and physical aid to the poor and infirm in the congregation, when needed, and any other similar matters relative to company affairs and the service. It will also be the duty of the committee to make recommendations for servants to the Society, in accordance with paragraph 82 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization.</span><span class="font4"> All such recommendations should be signed by each member of the committee. The recommendations must be impartial and always for the best interests of the company. Publishers should not be recommended until they have published for one full year after immersion.—See Philippians 2 : 3, 4 ; James 2:1-9; and 1 Timothy 3:2-10, A'W.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> It must be remembered that the company servant takes full oversight in the company and that the other members of the committee are to work closely<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> with him in supervising the company’s activities.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> When difficulties arise in the company because of an individual's conduct and the congregation and persons of good will are affected, the Bible places the responsibility for handling such matters in the hands of the &quot;older men”, and such difficulties may be handled by the company committee or, if assigned, other mature brothers who are Scripturally- qualified. If the company servant feels it advisable, he may select two mature brothers other than those on the company committee to handle these particular difficulties. This assigned committee, after hearing all tlie evidence and witnesses, can recommend whether the guilty<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> individuals should be removed from their servants’ positions, disfellowshiped, or just counseled and given a chance to prove their repentance and good intentions. If a disfellowshiped person has repented, and shown this by right works over a period of time, such committee can recommend his acceptance back into the congregation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The company committee should always be willing to receive suggestions from the publishers and give them careful consideration, and should be at unity and in harmony so that it can carry out its duties to the honor and glory<sup><a href="#bookmark30">7</a></sup><sup></sup> of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Instead of the distracting and deceiving propaganda put forth as knowledge by this present system of things, it is the taking In of the soul-satisfying knowledge of Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus, that means everlasting life. (John 17:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Just as Jehovah sent his Son to bear him witness, so now he sends forth his witnesses to carry this lifegiving knowledge to everyone, that they might exercise faith in him and not perish at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During August we will give everyone the opportunity to gain this Ufe-giving knowledge by presenting afield the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font4">and a 32-page self-covered booklet, on a 35c contribution. While the weather is favorable continue to expand the coverage of territory to the rurals and outlying sections so that none are missed. Hold outdoor public meetings where advantageous. Locally arrange for house-to-house, store-to-store and street witnessing so all can join in spreading the knowledge that means everlasting life. With the servants planning and taking the oversight, the activity of the company should run smoothly. Publishers, remember to keep a record of the names and addresses of Interested persons in order that you can call back. Your calling back will show that you are sincerely interested in their gaining life.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Perceptive Powers Trained Through Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In the May </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> appeared this statement: “The mature servants and those just learning the pure language will together ‘call upon the name of Jehovah’ and serve him with one consent.” How can this good end be successfully accomplished? First, all must learn the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Back-Calls and Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In what better way than through back-calls and home Bible studies can you insure that those of good will are going to take in the lifegiving knowledge? These sheep must be fed. It is our privilege to do it. If we find them in isolated territory, it would be well to take time to show them how to use the book themselves in home Bible study. However, make a real effort to personally call back on all who obtain literature and inquire if they ‘understand what they read’, thereupon making a sincere and determined effort to start a home Bible study with them. Thereby they will be enabled to accurately take in the knowledge that leads to life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> By working through the company book studies in evening back-call work arrangements can be made to give personal help to the new publishers in this feature of the work. Every publisher should endeavor to conduct at least one home Bible study. Perhaps a demonstration can be put on the service meeting program to show how to tactfully turn a back-call into a home Bible study. The object of each Bible study is to equip interested persons with knowledge to serve Jehovah ; so, keep service prominently before them as you conduct the study. By encouraging them to witness to their acquaintances you will start them to pass on knowledge.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">pure language. This requires regular study and diligent use of the things learned. From the fundamentals of the language, the publisher must advance to maturity so that he can speak the pure language fluently. It is the mature publisher who stands the best chance of squarely meeting the issues and trials of these critical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Training and Assisting New Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Knowledge of Jehovah also includes instructive counsel on how to effectively serve him. The thousands of new publishers who have recently joined our ranks must become regular and mature ministers, able to teach others also. Since many of them came into the truth by studying the life-giving knowledge contained in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font4"> they should have little difficulty talking about it to others. Publishers, before taking these new ones into the field, help them prepare a testimony to use at the door in presenting the book. Show them how to keep a record of all the interest found, and, when necessary, go with them on their back-calls and assist them in starting home Bible studies. Complete your work of teaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Never should, we lose sight of the fact that in this manner Jehovah purposed to ‘teach the meek his way’. Exercise love and patience as we press on together in this lifesaving work. Help not only those whom we contact in the field, but, with even more good reason, those who are our brothers. So doing, we will maintain our present gains in publishers and insure Jehovah’s blessing for future increase. In all this Jehovah is to be praised, for it is his unselfish arrangement to extend life through his Son to all those who now take in life-giving knowledge.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">Two Stock Inventory forms </span><span class="font3">(S-7) </span><span class="font4">are being sent to each company and pioneer with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> An actual-count inventory of stock on hand is to be taken on March 1 and September 1 of each year, as stated in paragraph 120 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization for Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font4"> The count of your inventory taken on September </span><span class="font3">1 is</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Press On to Maturity” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd) </span><span class="font4">times and overcoming them faithfully. Mature knowledge and understanding of the truth or pure language is our safeguard.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> There is, then, a great need now for helping the many thousands of new publishers, who, in recent months, have joined our rank's, to grow to maturity and become adept at using the pure language. This will take time and effort, but then, we are commanded to &quot;work what is good toward all, but especially those related to us in the faith”. Such time and effort will be well spent. It will produce a mature body of ministers doing Jehovah’s service “with one consent”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Acquire Maturity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Since “a pupil is not above his teacher, but everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher”, it is imperative that every Kingdom publisher “pay constant attention” to his teaching. (Luke 6: 4b, AIT) See that your Bible studies are lively and interesting. Strive to give sound instruction to these many new ones. Having taught them the “elementary doctrine about the Christ&quot; kindle a desire in them to speak the truth to others. When taking them into the field service, help them develop a pleasant and appealing testimony. Set a proper example for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Additionally, the company meetings are the Lord's provision through his organization for aiding publishers and people of good will to progress together to maturity. That is why it is necessary for company servants to try to make the meetings full of instruction. Servants, face the weak points in your company’s service, determine how to overcome them, and at the meetings suggest workable means to remedy them. Let the meeting serve to encourage and train the publishers for the ministry. Brothers, when you are assigned a part on the program, prepare well; do your best. Make it practical and instructive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Publishers, it is in your life's interest as well as those of persons of good will<sup>1</sup> to attend all meetings. Therefore, see that the newly interested are invited and brought to the meetings to receive and profit by the counsel and training given. If you feel timid and backward about preaching, then make an effort to openly express the pure language at the various company meetings by commenting in answer to questions. Use the truths you learn in study. Make them a usable part of your pure-Ianguage vocabulary. If you don’t, the results may prove disastrous. To illustrate. One not using a language for a period of time risks losing even that which he knows, but if it is used by him, he becomes</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>To a Hell-Fire Believer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">It will require tact and good judgment by Jehovah's ministers to appeal to the minds of those who believe in the hell-fire doctrine. Some will exercise a reasoning attitude, while others will exhibit a fanatical disposition when approached on the subject. Therefore our presentation must be governed to a great extent, not only by what we say, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">how </span><span class="font4">we say it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For instance, you are calling on a householder and presenting the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let (tod Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> Upon opening the book to the table of contents to show the various subjects treated in the book, the householder notes the subject on “hell”, and inquiringly asks, “I understand you people do not believe in hell, is that true?” Calmly and considerately you can then suggest turning to the chapter on “Hell, a Place of Rest in Hope”, and note a few points discussed in a paragraph or two to establish the correct Bible viewpoint on the subject. After satisfactorily answering the controversial question, the person can then be encouraged to learn further by procuring a copy of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other hand, fanatical hellfire believers who are informed of our disbelief of such doctrine usually confront us with the outburst: &quot;You people don’t believe in hell! I don’t want to have anything to do with you I etc.” Do not countercharge or retort with any rash statements. Instead, with calmness you fluent. So it is with the truth or pure language. Those who are diligent in studying and speaking the truth in meetings and field service are the ones who are seen to grow to maturity. They are, as the apostle I’aul said, “Mature people . . . who thbough vsb have their perceptive powers trained.” (Heb. 5:14, ATT) Train your perceptive powers by using the things learned. Doing this will have a wholesome effect on everyone. All will, as a result, become more qualified to teach.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Don’t be content to just “get along&quot; in the ministry. Rather, seek to excel. “Press on to maturity.” Advance from the elementary doctrines of the truth, such as, repentance, where the dead are, baptism, Armageddon, etc., to more meaty things. Become well-balanced teachers, with a mature knowledge of truth from which strength can be drawn and understanding imparted might answer like this: “But I do believe in the hell mentioned in the Bible. When the scripture at Acts 2: 31 states that Jesus went to hell when he died, and arose out of hell the third day, I firmly believe that truth. However, the question that enters my mind, and no doubt yours also, is, If hell is a place of fiery torment reserved for only the wicked, then what was Jesus doing there? I am sure we both agree that, according to the Scriptures, Jesus was perfect and without sin, and therefore that would be no place for him to be. Likewise, is it not true that no one can ever come out of hell, according to popular religious teaching? And yet, Jesus did come out of hell the third day when he was resurrected. Logically, then, the hell mentioned in the Bible and which Jesus went into could be nothing more than the grave.” Then sidetrack this controversial subject to a Kingdom witness. Show how Jesus, after his resurrection and ascension, sat down at his Father’s right hand and awaited the due time to establish Kingdom rule and its blessings. Only after a proper frame of mind has been established would it be wise for the publisher to return to a further discussion of the “hell” subject.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Never be rash or use cutting remarks toward those who oppose themselves. Instead, be kind and considerate, always using tact in presenting the good news. Unquestionably, it will result to Jehovah’s honor and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to others whom you teach. Make disciples of people of all the nations. Set an example of maturity for them. Unselfishly “strengthen the weak hands, and the tottering knees make firm”. Study with them, take them to our meetings and into the service. Thus doing, the mature servants and those just learning the pure language will together ‘call upon the name of Jehovah’ and serve him with one consent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In times past, Jehovah’s witnesses have had the privilege of witnessing before many authorities of the lanti. By contending for our rights from the police court right on up, we have succeeded, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, in building a mass of precedent to protect our legal rights. However, the battle to keep the way open to preach the good news is not over, for the enemy is constantly striving to break down that which has been built up. This demonstration, therefore, is for the purpose of showing the need of preparedness when accosted by local policemen.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I: (4 minutes) An unprepared publisher is doing street magazine work. He Is accosted by a policeman and, after a brief discussion, is arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publisher, not having studied </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good N'eics,</span><span class="font4"> is found standing in front of a store window. The policeman approaches him and explains that the manager complains that he is blocking the view and blocking the traffic, and wouldn’t he please move out to the curb. Immediately the publisher becomes excited, firmly announcing that he will not move and that he will stand on his constitutional rights. He quotes such scripture as “We must obey God rather than men” and' denounces man-made laws. The patient policeman tries to reason with the publisher, but finally loses his composure and gruffly places him under arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II: (6 minutes) A well-prepared publisher is standing on the street and he too is accosted by an officer. After </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> calm discussion, he agrees to go down to the station and have a talk with the desk sergeant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This publisher, having studied the legal booklet, is standing near the curb away from the store windows and traffic. While he is energetically presenting the magazines to passers-by, the officer approaches him and informs him that because of complaints raised, he will have to cease his work there. Calmly, the publisher suggests that perhaps the officer and complainants were misinformed concerning the legality of his work. While saying this, he brings out his copy of the legal booklet. He explains that there have already been a number of similar eases, and he points to a few of them in the legal booklet. The policeman is somewhat taken aback and seems a little uncertain of himself. The publisher further points out that as long as he is not blocking traffic or disturbing the peace, there certainly could be no valid objection to his being there. The publisher, being calm and sure of his legal standing, has partially convinced the policeman of his right to be there. But the officer is under orders, so he asks the publisher to go to the station with him and explain that to the desk sergeant. To this the publisher agrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III: (10 minutes) The publisher and the policeman are talking to the desk sergeant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The policeman explains that this is the person against whom the complaint was registered, but after talking to him, he isn't sure that the publisher is doing anything unlawful. The desk sergeant then asks the publisher the nature of his work. Using the information on pages 7, 24 and 87 of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing- the Good News. </span><span class="font4">the publisher shows exactly what he was doing, why he was doing it and the Scriptural backing for it, and how he is trained to do it properly without creating a disturbance or violating the law. The desk sergeant raises three objections, which are answered by referring him to the court decisions listed on page 36 and in the appendix. The desk sergeant then agrees that the publisher should be released without charges being filed, and he returns to his street corner to resume his Kingdom service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">to be recorded on these forms accurately and completely. Send the original to the Society no later than September 5, and retain the duplicate for your files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">List on this inventory only literature that is usable in the field, literature that is clean and in good condition. Note on the inventory form the title of any literature of which you have a large supply in stock. Foreign literature should also be listed; however, do not include the value of foreign literature received </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font4"> from the Society, in the Total Value of Literature on Hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Total Valve of the completed inventory will include the total value of literature on hand, amount of cash on hand (book money), and the value of literature held on credit by the publishers, if any. The company servant should check with the stock servant to see that the inventory is properly taken, and give him help if necessary. The results of this inventory and the latest statement of the company’s indebtedness to the Society should be read to the company.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Use Your Booklet Stock</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the prevailing paper shortage, the Society has had to curtail the printing of English booklets. However, according to the stock inventories of September 1, 1950, ten million booklets are in the hands of companies and pioneers, therefore it is advisable to draw from this reserve. Circuit servants should take note of the supplies of booklets in the companies which they serve and if possible arrange for a redistribution of booklets. Where one company is overstocked and another needs them, a transfer should be made by the companies involved. Listed below are the booklets the Society has in stock and which you may order if needed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the paper shortage, companies and pioneers should order no more than a one-year supply of any fokii. When an order is in excess of a one-year supply, the Society will reduce it to prevent an overstock. For example, consider the new Accounts Sheet (SC-8). Large companies will seldom use more than one form a month, while smaller companies will use one form every two months, so 15 would be an ample supply for one year. When it is necessary for the office to change the quantity ordered extra time is taken here in handling orders and also an adjustment in your remittance and in your company account is required. Use discretion when ordering forms.</span></p>

Companies will receive a credit each month for those placed with pioneers. This is an excellent opportunity for back-calls, home Bible studies and new publishers to obtain them at this reduced rate. Check with your company publishers and pioneers in your company as to how many each one would like to have. Then place the order with other literature. Your prompt orders will be filled as long as we have stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be fearless means to put our complete trust in Jehovah: to enter into the truth, the commands, the service and the love of God with all we have. If we do this we can say, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.” (Ps. 46:1,2) Knowing we have His never-failing strength with us we can and will remain fearless to the accomplished end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fearlessness is also required of the other sheep. Yes, they too must be strong-hearted. To start them in the right way we must disclose and demonstrate the faith we have, the prospect before those serving Jehovah and the unlimited power with which he backs them up. This will move them in the direction of faith in God and trust in his almighty power for the realization of their fondest desires.

It will be easy for such to join with us in door-to-door work and in calling back on the many new subscribers and literature obtainers. Help them get the full benefit from the publications by discussing their contents and arranging to use them to conduct home Bible studies. Then as these too become new publishers, help them to become efficient, mature ministers by taking them with you into the field and to the Kingdom Hall. Here they will meet others who, like themselves, are doing this work. Seeing the fearless organization of God in action, they will take courage and remain fearless to the accomplished end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Organizing and arranging for advertising the Kingdom message throughout the company’s territory is the responsibility resting upon the advertising servant.

Complete organization is very necessary so that on Magazine Day all in the company may enthusiastically engage in magazine distribution from store to store and house to house. Advertising servants would 'do well to organize work in their territory in harmony with the suggestions given at the recent district assemblies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Territories for street-corner and store-to-store activity will be made up and issued by the advertising servant. When house-to-house territory is worked on Magazine Day, the advertising servant can obtain regular territory cards from the territory servant and return them when completed.

<p><span class="font4">The Society now has in stock color post cards, which are similar to the ones released at Yankee Stadium, with new scenes of Gilead and of the factory. Sets of 10 post cards have been prepared, with each set consisting of 4 pictures of Gilead, 1 of WBBR at Staten Island, 3 of Bethel, 1 of the Bethel Kingdom Hall, and 1 of the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cost of the post cards is 25c per set of 10, or $2.50 for 10 sets. Please order in multiples of 10 sets only: 10 sets, 20 sets, etc. All publishers associated with a company should order through the local company, as this saves the Society time and expense in handling orders. Since these are Cash Items, a covering remittance must accompany each order.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Convention Reports</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">A limited quantity of the report on the 1950 International convention is still on hand. These may be obtained at the reduced rate of 15c per copy.</span></p>

Publishers should regularly take the number of magazines they order. The company servant should be advised when to increase or decrease the order for magazines during campaigns. When magazines are received from the Society, the advertising servant will count them and inform the accounts servant of the issue and number received. Money for magazines placed with publishers will be turned over to the accounts servant each week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Public meetings deserve much advertising. Usually this will be worked in with street work and regular service activity. Handbills and placards should be used whenever possible. Where window space Is available at the Kingdom Hall, the advertising servant will keep a neat display in the window. It should be changed from time to time, at least once a month, so it will always be clean and attractive.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Advertise! Advertise! Advertise I is what Jehovah commands his people to do during these last days. By the advertising servant’s taking the proper oversight of his duties, the Kingdom message will be advertised throughout the territory.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>34 Per Cent Increase —Goal for 1951 !</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During the 1950 service year 115 countries reported ! Each year brings a larger number of countries into the field of action. But what is even more thrilling than this is the marvelous increase in publishers that lias resulted from all the preaching activity. Of these 115 countries reporting, 28 had an increase in publishers of 50 per cent or more, and 45 had an increase of 34 per cent or more! We marvel at the work accomplished in other lands, but we are inclined to dismiss from our minds the possibility of such an increase right here at home. In the United States we had an increase of 19 per cent. Why should we be behind those 45 countries with increases of better than 34 per cent?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Consider: Are there fewer sheep in our country? Is witnessing so much more difficult here? Are we lacking in literature and equipment? Are we financially hindered in preaching? No, for in all these points we are better off on a whole than our brothers throughout the world, being blessed with abundance. Should not we then show appreciation by increased effort?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Goal</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Brother Knorr, as president of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, suggests that in addition to our quota of 10 per cent increase on an average we strive to increase the peak number of publishers by 34 tier cent over the 1950 peak. That would mean a peak of 144,913 publishers reporting by next August. Certainly this is not impossible, for last April 144,890 persons attended the Memorial. Should not these persons also be heralding the good news of the Kingdom to others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Everyone must make the increase his business. It will require the co-operation of everyone: district servants, circuit servants, servants in the company, pioneers, and company publishers. Earnest zeal must be displayed on every hand.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">of publishers, or 220,000 subscrip-1 tions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> While people in general do not appreciate the priceless value of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch tower,</span><span class="font4"> we do, and can therefore enthusiastically present the magazine. In your presentation show how attractive and valuable it is in gaining a clear understanding of the Creator’s purposes. Be prepared. Read your own copy. Know its contents. Then use that knowledge in making your presentation. Back issues may be left with the people as sample copies. Calling hack on such placements will provide openings for obtaining more subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The primary avenue for obtaining new subscriptions is the regular presentation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">from house to house. If one fully appreciates the importance of this essential part of the ministry, he Will set aside a definite time each week to participate in the house-to-house presentation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Be determined not to let small and incidental things prevent you from sharing in the witness given from house to house.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Assist Each Other</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> If till now you have not had an active part in the house-to-house witness work, take advantage of the Lord's organization with its mature servants to help you get started during this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. Accompany one of the more experienced publishers for a while, or when the circuit servant visits your company, go with him. Servants and mature brothers and sisters, you are in position to help train and encourage these persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Companies may profitably spend a few minutes, before going out in group witnessing, to demonstrate or discuss some effective ways to present the offer. The conductor should check to see that each one has the needed equipment, such as subscription slips, sample copies and record sheets. Keep an accurate record of all subscriptions placed and interest found, because you will want to call back and cultivate this initial interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> How will we cover our vast territory and give the final witness? With increased effort, of course! We will extend our preaching time by getting an earlier start and remaining in the field for longer periods of time. And we will aid others to bear witness of our reigning King and the blessings of his rule. We are determined during 1951 to spread the pure language of the ‘good news of the Kingdom for the purpose of a witness’.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>At the Doors</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Honest persons in all walks of life desire life in peace and happiness and are now distressed by the perilous times in which we live. They need a comforting and cheering message, and Jehovah’s witnesses have it! Confidently approach the door with these thoughts in mind. When you contact the householder, it is wise to make known the purpose of your call as soon as possible. Do not act hurried or frightened, but speak calmly and distinctly so that what you say will be understood. Be friendly and conversational, just as if you were talking to your neighbor. You might choose to introduce the message in this manner:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning, I am Mr.------,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">a minister of the gospel engaged in a Bible educational work. In these perilous times people all over the world need the comfort and hope that comes from knowing what God’s purposes are respecting the earth. This information can be obtained only by an examination of God’s Word, the Bible. The Bible teaches us to pray for God’s kingdom to come, because through it we are to receive peace, security and life. It is comforting to know that that kingdom is here and we can confidently look forward to the blessings it will bring. I have a publication with me that shows where these facts are given in the Bible. It is this magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">whose purpose is to announce Jehovah’s kingdom. Look what it has to say in this paragraph about that kingdom.’’ Thereafter inform the householder how he can get </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> For those still uncertain as to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">34 Per Cent Increase! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued) </span><span class="font4">Each publisher should make a personal goal of starting one new publisher in the service during the 1951 service year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The increase is on! No power under the sun can stop it! Thousands of good-will persons are waiting to be fed with the truth and helped into the preaching activity. The challenge is before us. Will we measure up to it? Already we have seen in the first month of the service year an increase of 3,500 publishers over last year’s peak. This is the time when everyone must do the value of the magazine to them, you can point out its excellent features. It contains enlightenment on important Bible prophecies that are ancient patterns for present-day happenings : it answers puzzling and perplexing questions in each issue; it considers the lives and actions </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font4">Bible characters, as well as doctrine, recent archaeological findings, research on ancient writings, languages, history and geography. Of special interest are the articles dealing with human relations, conduct, rearing of families, etc. And do not forget its convenient size, easily read type on non-glare paper, and colorful illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Or, you might be able to use the handbills to good advantage in introducing the gospel at the doors. After introducing yourself and stating the purpose of your call, you might say: “A part of this work is the holding of free Bible lectures. Please accept this personal invitation to attend one that will be given this week. These meetings and lectures are but a small part of the work we are doing. The greater part is the helping of the people at their homes to get an intimate knowledge of the purposes of Almighty God as they are found in the Bible. For that very reason this publication has been provided. Just listen to what it says here about the purpose of Jehovah in establishing his kingdom and what it will do for all men of good will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Servants can plan demonstrations utilizing the above introductions or any other approach that is friendly and appealing. To accomplish the most in your house-to-house preaching, prepare yourself to introduce the good news at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">his part in educating such persons to Jehovah’s praise. Our goal is 34 per cent increase in the peak of publishers! Can we do it? With determined effort and Jehovah’s help, we will do it in 1951!</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A regular feature of this column will be to outline suggestions for demonstrations to improve your service meetings and to assist you in fulfilling your ministry. Do you feature demonstrations on your service meetings? Are your meetings lively, interesting, practical and Instructive? Are the most effective and successful means of presenting the good news illustrated by demonstrations so that all publishers can benefit from them? The following material should be planned for one service meeting during the month. Approximate time will be from 10 to 15 minutes.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This demonstration should answer two objections commonly raised by many when offered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> namely, (1) “I have too many magazines already. I don't need </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower&quot; ;</span><span class="font4"> and (2) “My church supplies me with all the reading matter I need. I am quite satisfied with what I have.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SCENE: Publisher on the doorstep talking to man of the house. Assume that the publisher has already made his initial presentation of “The Watchtower”. The demonstration can open up with the man of the house raising the first objection noted above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In refuting this objection do not denounce their magazines, but show where </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> fills a need their publications do not. Their magazines are all right in their field, but they do not point out the way to everlasting life. Have they found that those periodicals give them the knowledge that is required to meet life’s problems? Just how much of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lasting</span><span class="font4"> value have they gained from them? They will generally agree, too, that many magazines feature things of little or no value, being printed primarily to entertain. Contrast this with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> what it has to offer. It is in a class by itself. It points the way to everlasting life by announcing the established kingdom of God. What would you, as one of earth’s people, say is our greatest need? Is it not God’s kingdom for which you as a God-fearing person have been taught to pray? Do you realize that to live in it you must live for it? And to live for it you must learn about it? From there you could point to a certain section of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">that will substantiate your argument and show the practical value of having such a magazine come regularly to the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND SCENE: The living room of a religious home. In this scene the publisher has been invited into the house, where he makes a brief presentation of &quot;The Watchtower”. The householder counters with objection number two. In overcoming this the publisher may use the following points:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ask if they always find time to read their church magazines. In the majority of cases the answer will be No. Then, certainly, they cannot consider them completely satisfactory or necessary. Though they are busy, surely, if they considered these publications vital, they would find time to read them, for almost all people find the time to do the things they really want to do. Whether the answer is yes or no the publisher may tactfully draw the person out on the matter. Do you find that your publications have the answer to world conditions? Do they offer you a solid hope for the future? By reading them, do you acquire peace of mind, security and the hope for everlasting life? Then illustrate just how </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">meets and satisfies these needs. It answers their Bible questions, explains the reason for the world crisis, establishes hope in a new world, gives peace of mind and security by showing what the future holds forth and how to prepare for it. Have something definite that you can point to in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> that will stir their interest and arouse theii' desire for the publication. The publisher might tell how </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has aided him, the value he places on it, prompting him to give his time freely and unselfishly to bring them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministry School </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued) </span><span class="font4">tion have that rendering? Why does the AW? Note footnote <sup>b</sup>. In 1: 2-16 note the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AV</span><span class="font4"> rendering “begat” and how the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW</span><span class="font4"> improves over it to show whether it refers to the conception of the child or its birth. Note the names in the genealogy: Do they agree with the Greek text spelling or with the Hebrew text of the ancient scriptures? How about their hyphening and accenting? Do not overlook any of the footnotes on the first page (page 35). Is there any value in the cross references In the side margin?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Note “Christ” In 1:16. Is Jesus always spoken of as “Christ” without the article, and does the expression “the Christ” mean exclusively the “body of Christ”? See 2:4. At 1: 18 note “holy spirit”. Is the omission of the definite article an affront to the “Holy Trinity”, and why does the AW here carry no definite article? See the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott’s </span><span class="font4">Greek text and the interlinear word-for-word translation. What does this indicate concerning “spirit”? Note the first appearance of “Jehovah”, at 1: 20. Why does the footnote say, “Jehovah's or Yahweh’s”? What authority is there for this rendering? What does the footnote on “Jesus” in 1: 21 show for this name? Even if the name “Jehovah” were not in the main text of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW, </span><span class="font4">would “Jehovah” still be in the Christian Greek Scriptures, according to this footnote? Note the difference of Hebrew authorities for 1: 22 and 2: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In 2:1 were those visitors “wise men” or of demonic w-isdom? According to 2:2 and 9 did they see his star to the eastward and travel east? At 2:4 what does the footnote show for “the Christ”? According to 2:13, was Jesus then a newborn babe? Do not overlook the footnotes on this next page (38). At 2: 23 what does the footnote <sup>d</sup> have to say for that unknown town of Nazareth, and hence what does footnote <sup>e</sup> have to say in relation thereto? (See October 15, 1950, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for additional examples.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The above represent some of the features that the student speakers in particular might watch for and call to the special note of their auditors. This represents the system of analytical commentary that they are to follow in delivering their talks on the text of the AW.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Now for the speakers on the chain-reference words. For the first lesson, you may group the references on “Abraham” in similar passages. But in your alloted time try to bring to the fore all the outstanding references on Abraham. Do not dw<sup>r</sup>ell too long on any one feature about him, but try to show his justification by works as well as faith, his meeting Melchizedek, his ‘attempting to offer up his only-begotten son', etc. Have your auditors follow<sup>7</sup> along with you in their copies of the AW.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> This assistance rendered by the speakers will aid all attending the school to learn, how to do research work in the A'W for themselves, and so make us all more able ministers of God’s Word. Good demonstrations on the proper w<sup>T</sup>ay to use the AW w’ill show many who attend the service meeting why they should always attend and support the theocratic ministry school.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">It has been Impossible to keep up to date in filling all orders for recent publications, even though the Society’s factory has been working extra hours. Already one and a quarter million copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font4"> have been shipped out, yet we are far behind in filling orders. We ask, therefore, that you do not write the Society regarding these delayed orders, as they will be filled as soon as we are able. In the meantime if you do not have the campaign literature, use whatever you have for your field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You may note some of your orders have been reduced. This we are doing so as to extend our limited supply.</span></p>

C.. of his current address within ten days thereafter and during the same period in each succeeding year. Failure to do so will subject one to prosecution.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Call back on persons to whom you have given sample copies. Subscriptions are many times obtained in this way. Even if the person does not subscribe, perhaps you can place the latest issue with him and further kindle his interest. Note all such placements and call back on these prospective sheep.

<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> In making known the good news, a minister must be prepared. By taking down pertinent information concerning the person, a good back-call can be prepared which will fan that spark of interest into a flame. Being prepared, we can radiate the enthusiasm so contagious to the other sheep.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> During January we will have gained much valuable experience in presenting the offer. We will be able to begin February at full speed. So forward go during February to ‘make known the good news’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “Company” is the designation given a group of Jehovah’s witnesses that meet together in a certain locality for worship, Bible study and united preaching activity. Such a company is enrolled and organized by the Society. It receives its territory assignment, literature, supplies and instructions for effective service from the Society. Each company as an organization has the responsibility, and its chief objective is, to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all its inhabited territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Various servants are appointed to serve the company by overseeing its functions, arranging and providing meetings, and taking the lead in the various features of field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> A Kingdom Hall is secured by the company so that persons of good will can be directed to the company meetings and Bible studies. It serves as a center for theocratic activity. In turn, the publishers support the company by making voluntary contributions to defray its expenses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The Society deals with the publishers through the company organization, providing the service needs of pioneers and company publishers alike. The Society looks out for the spiritual welfare of the company by sending circuit servants to visit it periodically to observe its condition, offer needed counsel and advice as to how it can overcome its weak</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> not only is to serve and instruct the Kingdom publisher, but serves also to stimulate persons of good will to engage in field service. Therefore, not only those who attend the service meeting should lie given a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Infoiiiiant. </span><span class="font4">but all those listed as regular or irregular publishers. The company servant should see that all the infirm and sick publishers receive a copy. Your supply should be large enough to care for all the above plus a few extra for the newly interested who attend. It will no longer be necessary to put the names on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font4"> before distributing them. Publishers, take care of your </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> study it carefully, take it with you to the service meetings, make kt be your servant for more effective ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> To conquer the cruel and mindenslaving force of fear, Jehovah has given us the most powerful weapon in the world. This is the mighty “sword of the spirit&quot; which is able to give us a defense that is better than any carnal weapon. This sword, or the Word of the Lord, “is alive and exerts power&quot; and “is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart”. Those who go to it for guidance and search diligently in it for knowledge will be blessed by the Lord’s spirit with understanding. Because this has been proved true with all of the Lord’s servants, the psalmist rightly and confidently proclaims : “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.”—Ps. 46: 1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Our hearts were joyful as a result of the “good things” received at the district assemblies. But here is something more: an opportunity to receive greater provisions at the assembly the Society’s president announced (at Gilead graduation) for the week end of October 12-14, 1951, at Griffith Stadium, in Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of brothers, Including the president, will be back from London and other European assemblies, and will have information we will be eagerly awaiting. The new London releases will also be available. All who can attend are invited and encouraged to make every possible effort to take advantage of this provision of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now is the time to begin arranging your affairs in order to attend. Immediate and definite plans will have</span></p>

Confidently we go forward in our work of preaching the good news, though the forces of this entire world be against us. There are many more of the Lord’s other sheep that need to be found and fed. and we do not cower in fear at what may seemingly be impending. Bather, we go confidently forward in the strength of Jehovah, fearlessly we enter the new service year, and we will work unitedly with our brothers world-wide in presenting the campaign offer for the month. In the United States this will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’</span><span class="font5"> with one self-covered booklet, on the contribution of 35c.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The London, England, International Assembly</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To the great Wembley Stadium they came, thousands of them, from forty nations, eagerly, knowing that their days together would n ore than justify ail the expenditure of effort, time and resources they made to be in London on the first five days of August. And why not? Had they not received through the organization of the new world society an invitation to back up by their presence a theocratic assembly? Important were previous Christian conventions in London; of outstanding importance they knew this one would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And it was! In its title is seen its theme: &quot;The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Clean Worship </span><span class="font5">Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Assurance, optimism, encouragement. these prevailed throughout the program. Practical were the many features relative to meetings, conduct, organization, ministry. Thrilling were the many reports from countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, the islands, the Americas. Vital were the spiritual truths set out in clarity for the first time. Devastating to demon religion was the resolving of the issues in the current fight to the finish between true and false worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upward of 20,000 were in attendance on Wednesday, opening day. Meetings were scheduled in many languages other than English throughout the five days. Brother N. H. Knorr’s first discourse was on Thursday afternoon. His subject: “Confidently Facing the End,” and at its conclusion he released four splendid little tracts, briefly outlining their use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The immersion was held Friday forenoon in a beautiful lake, and 1,123 were baptized. Friday’s program included a discourse on “Baptism for Salvation and Fire Baptism”, correcting our viewpoint of scriptures involved. “Making Your Mind Over for New World Living” was Brother Knorr’s subject Friday evening, and he spoke Saturday afternoon on “The Triumph of Clean, Undefiled Worship”, to 22,-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">International Assembly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">250. Powerful were the truths set out. and the conventioners were overjoyed when at the conclusion of his talk on Saturday Brother Knorr released A NEW BOUND BOOK: “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” Yes, the London convention was one of “firsts” in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Comes Sunday, August 5, and the morning sessions were climaxed by a discourse, “Princes Shall Rule in Justice,” applying properly the thirty-second chapter of Isaiah. Then the public address, delivered to 36,315: “Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?” And It was in booklet form, released at the conclusion of the speech!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is such a brief report of the great assembly, but may it further whet our appetites for further presentations of that spiritual food. Yes, the American brothers who went to London were well repaid, as were all in attendance. Perhaps at any future international convention, whenever and wherever that may be, this country of the United States will be better represented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the grand and informative international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses held at London, England, August 1-5, 1951, the Society released a new 352-page bound book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> Additionally, a 32-page booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?</span><span class="font5"> was released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Copies of the publisher’s edition, the only edition of this book now available, can be obtained on a contribution of 50 cents each and the booklet at 5 cents per copy. Company servants should ascertain immediately the number of publishers desiring personal copies and then submit an order covering the company’s need. Do not order regular editions for use in the field service until advised to do so at a later date.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>To the Atheist</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Atheism is one of the many means the Devil is using to turn mankind away from the true God, Jehovah. It furnishes an objection that can be difficult to overcome if we are not prepared to meet it. What would you say if someone said to you, “I am an atheist”? Perhaps you could say something like this:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> “Well, that is understandable, seeing the condition the world is in and also the hypocrisy of so many who claim to believe in God. Yet, that does not deny the existence of a Creator. Take a little watch, for instance. It could not possibly have just happened, with all its intricate and inter-working parts. It took intelligent minds, the minds of men. to put it together. How much more complex than a watch are the solar system and the universe which run on a much more accurate time schedule than the finest watch ! And look at the intricate complexity of all life, plant and animal. Does not that all indicate the presence of a great Mastermind? How could any of these things have just happened, any more than a watch could just happen? Romans 1:19-23 bears this out. And, too, God’s Word, the Bible, is an accurate scientific book, referring to many now-known scientific facts that were supposed to have been discovered only in the last few centuries. It offers the only reliable remedy for the world conditions, and condemns hypocrisy. And that is why we are calling, to show the</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Bible Tracts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord through his visible organization is continually supplying us with additional equipment to aid us in our work of preaching the good news effectively. To this end the Society released at the London assembly four Bible tracts dealing with timely subjects. Here are provisions that will prove of real benefit, and they are just what many have been asking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These attractive two-color 6-page Bible tracts (samples sent to each company) are so designed as to attract the attention of the people and create a desire to pick them up and read them. The titles are eye-appealing. The material in these tracts is written so as to hold the atten-people that remedy, God’s kingdom through Christ . . .”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Of course, many atheists will bring up the doctrine of evolution to explain how the universe and man came into existence. Then you might say something to this effect:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> “My main objection to the evolution theory is that there is such a lack of evidence to prove it. For instance, prominent evolutionists have admitted that there are a great number of missing links in the chain of life forms from which man is supposed to have evolved. In fact, one of them said that most life forms, fossils of which have been found in various layers of rocks in the earth, have all the ‘characteristics of absolute creation’. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World,</span><span class="font5"> page 17.) But what is even more puzzling is that the first link, where life started, has never been produced. Darwin admitted that the first form of life was probably created. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibid.,</span><span class="font5"> page 18) So if one admits the creation of the first life form, why discount the creation of the others? Incidentally, I have a little booklet here, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The Xciv World.</span><span class="font5"> You would no doubt be interested in what it has to say.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> In preaching to the atheist and evolutionist, one must adopt a materialistic approach, and he must point to tangible evidence of the Creator and his creations. He must try to establish confidence in the reasonableness of the Bible. In this way it will be possible to make known the good news to those who are sincere in these beliefs.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">tion of the reader once he begins to read them. Sufficient meat is contained in them to cause people to think and inquire for further information. Their attention is also called to other literature that can be obtained to increase Bible knowledge. The Bible tracts will fill a great need. Announcement of availability will be made later.

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If new and irregular publishers are to make rapid progress and become regular and effective ministers, they must be instructed in what to say and how to say it, given an assignment and shown by example how to carry it out. This Jesus did for his new apostles and disciples. He told them where to go, told them what to say, and set them a proper example in the field. (Matt. 10: 5-7; Luke 4: 43; Luke 8: 1, NW) The following demonstration should show how to follow this Christian example now in helping our brothers become efficient and productive ministers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE ONE: Early Sunday morning a mature publisher calls for the one with whom he conducts a home Bible study to go in the field service. (4 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This newly Interested one has not as yet engaged in the house-to-house work. Having this in mind, the mature publisher calls early in order that some time can be spent helping the new publisher prepare a testimony to use at the door during the morning’s field service. Tactfully he helps him decide upon a point or two in the book that can be used in its presentation. (For example, the need people have for new world conditions described on pages 2C1-2G3 of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.)</span><span class="font5"> Thereafter they leave for the field to work in the mature publisher’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE TWO: Both publishers are in the field. (6 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mature publisher suggests new publisher accompany him to door for first few calls. Mature publisher makes first presentation, leaving booklet with promise to call back, and then shows the new publisher how to use House to House Record, so he will know where to call back. Thereafter new publisher is encouraged to try the next door alone using presentation previously decided upon at home. He makes presentation, copying mature publisher's example, and, using points discussed earlier, he places book, and gets person’s name and promises to call back. This scene should close with new publisher asking mature one to go with him when he makes the back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE THREE: Two weeks later. Both publishers are calling back on new publisher’s book placement. (6 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before approaching the door they decide to proceed on a definite course in their discussion. They choose to use the chapter “Who Is Jehovah?” in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> When greeted by the householder, they are asked to step in for a few minutes. After a few friendly remarks, the conversation is directed to the book and it is found that the person has not read much of it but seemed to like it. Since the householder has no Bible question of his own, the new publisher raises the question as to who Jehovah is. This catches the interest of the householder. For the answer, they turn to pages 21 to 32 of the book. The householder makes mention of never having noticed the name Jehovah in the so-called “New Testament”, and asks, “Why?” Paragraph 4 is discussed in answer. The mature publisher supports the argument with information found on pages 10-18 of the Foreword of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation. </span><span class="font5">The back-call ends with the householder asking for a copy of the A’eic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation,</span><span class="font5"> and arrangements are made to call back and further consider the book in a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">General Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these demonstrations strive to make them as natural as possible. The mature publisher should have in mind that he is training a new publisher and should therefore try to make bis sample presentation simple and to the point, yet appealing. Publishers receiving assistance should be shown that the object of all our witnessing as respects the sheep is to first find them and then feed them with the message of truth, in the most effective manner.</span></p>

Do not, however, go to Washington, D. C., ahead of time, unless the Society calls you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Circuit servants and district servants should keep this assembly before the publishers as they visit the companies and serve circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s blessing has always been upon these conventions which supply us with determination and wholesome instruction. Come fully prepared to attend each session, bring literature for witnessing and bring someone with you to the convention for feasting and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Remaining Fearless </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(continued) </span><span class="font5">priate arrangements for presenting the offer in the field, we will- keep in mind a primary objective for the year, that of giving all the help and training we can to those who have just started in the ministry, even as Paul’s desire was for the Philippian brothers.—Phil. 1: 8-11, AW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Servants should have an orderly procedure that is streamlined and efficient for assisting new publishers. Here are a few suggestions that can be worked into the system used. First of all, the assistant company servant will need to keep a close check on the Publisher’s Record card file and always have available the names of those that have not reported field service during the month. Early in the month, before the fifteenth of the month, and again close to the end of the month, he should furnish a list of those that have not published to the company book study conductors. They in turn can arrange to assist the irregular or new’ ones to participate in the service. The company servant should keep close check on the system to see that it is effective and results are obtained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The assistant company servant should also note from his records which publishers are obtaining good results in the field and pass this information on to the conductors. Some of our brothers other than appointed servants are very effective publishers. Perhaps several new publishers can be assigned to these mature publishers selected and each can then be responsible for regularly aiding the new’ publishers assigned to him in the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> These extensive arrangements are made that all might be effectively aided to appreciate their privileges of serving Jehovah and enjoy his blessing as they engage in theocratic activity. We are sure all will appreciate the kind assistance given by those who are assigned to care well for the needs of the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Throughout the year we want to always manifest the unselfish spirit of “one help another” and see that every provision made to insure the well-being of Jehovah’s people is used to the maximum. From the time newly interested ones begin to learn of Jehovah until they begin to attend company meetings regularly, participate in the service and grow to maturity, we want to show our love and consideration by giving them a helping hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Our commission is clear. We know we have much work before us which the Lord has assigned us to do. Fearlessly w<sup>r</sup>e will move forward to perform it until the accomplished end.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Do you want a real treat? One that will enable you, whether a company publisher, servant or pioneer, to better equip yourself for more efficient Kingdom service and to enjoy a greater part in the work of the Lord? Then upon receiving notice from the Society regarding the next circuit assembly in your circuit, start planning for it and be certain to attend! A sure blessing is in store for all who do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the week end of August 31-September 2 a new circuit assembly program goes into effect. Changes have been made in the Friday, Saturday and Sunday features. The Society feels that the new arrangement considers and deals very effectively with material important to God’s servants during the present time, and encourages all new world servants to feast on this provision of the Lord. The assembly will be very stimulating to persons of good will too, so do not hesitate to encourage them to attend or bring them along if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the whole, circuit assembly attendance has been splendid in all sections of the United States and the results have been very gratifying. However, a weakness has been noted in the Saturday night meeting attendance in some circuits. This meeting, which has as its purpose the considering anil overcoming of circuit weaknesses, has been completely revised, and the district servant, circuit servant, local servants, pioneers and company publishers will share in presenting helpful material on overcoming circuit weaknesses. This will be done by means of talks, pantomimes, discussions and demonstrations. The material to be considered is timely, being applicable to the circuit, and each publisher will derive much practical instruction from it. The Friday and Sunday changes will likewise be appreciated by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you receive the next invitation to attend a circuit assembly in your circuit, plan to attend all three days and be the recipient of rich blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This system of things and its invisible ruler, the Devil, are opposed to God’s will. This opposition is manifest as the masses of humanity vainly struggle for temporary success. Businessmen, clergy, educators and politicians join-forces to assure their fellow men a way of security and success. But the reality is that after repeated tries and failures, sorrow, distress and death have always resulted, because this old system of things does not know the way of success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s favored people know success lies only with Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus. By a study of his Word, the way that leads to life is revealed, and gladly do his servants adhere to it.

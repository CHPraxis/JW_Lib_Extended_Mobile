<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Under the full establishment of the new world every living intelligent creature will praise Jehovah God, the Almighty, as King. (Rev. 19:6, A'W’) Such is the purpose of the God of creation, and his will is sure to be fulfilled. The nucleus of this new world society of earth’s inhabitants is today being gathered from all races and nations. Undefiled praise Is increasing. Unitedly we will continue praising Jehovah during December by presenting to the public for the first time the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> and any available booklet, on a contribution of 50 cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Urgently the warning is given: Mass destruction to befall mankind ! And with mankind in general en-slayed to error and ignorance, great is their need for truth and light to break their bonds. The dark superstitions and beliefs perpetuated by the varied religious systems of earth must be proved false, if sincere-hearted persons are to be saved from impending destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The eye-opening Bible aid </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </span><span class="font3">is a godsend to these persons. It clears away the confusion and ig</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Can You Pioneer?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">4 Every person who has made a dedication of his life to serve Jehovah is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">obligated</span><span class="font3"> to serve him as much as he possibly can. If we have dedicated ourselves to his service, then everything we have should be used in praising the only true God. Why? Simply because we as consecrated Christians belong to Jehovah God through the merits of the ransom sacrifice he provided. “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price,” even the precious blood of Christ. (1 Cor. 6:19, 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> If you are one norance which clouds the minds of men and it leads them to pure paths of worship. Literally hundreds of scriptures from fifty-four books of the Bible are cited and indexed in support of pure worship. Authorities of religion and science, men of great worldly following, are quoted and their works cited with impressive force. (For examples, see pages 85, 247 and 295.) Thus the book is not a fanatical blast at false worship, but is a calm, factual, Scriptural consideration, which will open the minds of the enslave,d peoples. Call attention to the abovementioned points, as well as other appealing features, such as its subject index and Scripture index, color illustrations and large bold type. Show how it is a practical book of value and facts, pleasing to the eye and whetting the appetite.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> To ensure time being profitably-spent, the companies will prepare and present instructive service meetings, illustrating practical and effective methods of placing the combination in the hands of interested persons. Timely information on the importance of following up with back-calls and establishing home Bible studies should be presented. (Note the suggestions in “Presenting the Good News’’ and “Your Service of these devoted Christians, you belong to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> It is true that Jehovah makes allowance for certain ones who have Scriptural obligations which cannot otherwise be cared for. (1 Tim. 5:8; Matt. 15: 4-6, SIF; Ps. 103:13,14, AS') There are those who do not have such Scriptural obligations. Keep in mind that consecrated servants of Jehovah are not to take on obligations where there are unconsecrated relatives to carry the load, or, at least, not any more than their share of the burden. Our original covenant with Meeting” in this issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span><span class="font3"> Each publisher will want to take notes, while reading or studying the book, and thus have these good points in mind to use when offering the book and also prepare friendly presentations for personal use in the field service. Further, appointed servants and study conductors will work directly with the publishers in the field, aiding them to make effective use of this new book at the initial contact and at subsequent return calls. (Acts 15:36, .VF) The local company book-study arrangement can be of real aid as a service center. Midweek contact schedules should be arranged for all those who are able to meet with the group. Indeed, all publishers should avail themselves of every opportunity to present this new book, and then follow up their placements with back-calls and studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> We are determined to “press the battle to the gate”, exposing false religions and championing the one true religion. As enlightened new world ambassadors ours is the privilege of carrying the torch of freedom to the bedarkened prisoners, saying: “Go forth.” (Isa. 49: 9) We will thus show ourselves at unity with the organization of pure worship, inviting others -to praise Jehovah as King with us, and then have “sure success”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah still stands. We are bound to it and must “obey God rather than men”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Then, too, there are many who have erroneously concluded that the theocratic requirement for each and every publisher at the present is part-time service. The Scriptures argue against such a mental conclusion. Those who can Scripturally do more, and yet do not, can be likened to living in a “fool’s paradise”. God’s Word informs us to “honor Jehovah with thy substance”, and “to present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God”. (P¥ov. 3:9, AS; Rom. 12:1,- yiF) If it is Scripturally </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be Alert to Witness with Tracts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Have you found the tracts a ready instrument in incidental preaching? Do you use them to pave the way for future placements in your regular ministry? How well do you appreciate these fitting provisions from the Lord? If you have no physical obstacles to hinder your ministry, think of the innumerable opportunities you have of using the tracts to give an effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are limited in a physical way can also make wise use of the tracts. For example, one invalid sister wrote the Society relative to her joy over the use of the tracts: “I am an invalid doing my witness work by mail and telephone. I have mailed thousands of cards using material on the subjects listed in the index of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Equipped for Every Good Work’. </span><span class="font3">Along with this I have written out some of the principal points from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’</span><span class="font3"> books. So that I can make a direct contact, I usually send all my mall to people who have telephones. I make my back-calls by calling them up to find out their reaction to the letters I send them. I do find a great deal of trouble in expressing myself in writing; nevertheless, I always ask them to write to me if they have any questions on the subjects that I send out. Many have answered and said that they enjoyed my letters and cards, and are asking for further help. Can you imagine my joy when I first heard of the new tracts? Now I am able to send out a complete witness on a given subject. Along with these I include a few personal comments relative to the particular tract that I send. How wonderful it is to be able to supply those who request more information about our work with a well written tract which briefly yet satisfactorily presents the message 1 I know that many who are in the same position as I am will want to make wise use of this provision. I am thankful to the Lord’s visible organization for the efforts it puts forth in making the witness work possible for all who wish to praise the King.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you too had good results in using the tracts? Then send your experiences in to the Society so others may benefit. The. above may serve as a reminder to all of us to be “wise persons, buying out the opportune time”. (Eph. 5:15,16, A’W) [We are unable to print tracts as fast as they are being ordered, hence there may be a reduction in your order or delay in filling it.]</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Using the New Book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">December is here again! And with it comes the year’s end, bringing holidays which stir the world to heights of religious fervor. Now, while all the world is conscious of religion, Jehovah’s witnesses will present a timely new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> Preparation is necessary if we are to properly present it, and to aid in this, the following sample presentation is offered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Good morning, I am a minister calling in the interest of a worldwide Bible educational campaign. This work is vital now ■when one crisis after another faces mankind, and since religion is accepted by many as the answer to these crises, the plea for, more religion is being raised throughout the world today. As we know, religion has existed for thousands of years. So the question arises, What has religion done for mankind? We are all interested in this, for when we understand religion's part in human history we know what to expect of religion in this present crisis. I have a Bible-study aid here that deals with this subject, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Ha# Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> It is yours for a coptribution of only 50c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After this introduction, one might continue: “This book discusses the major religions and gives a practical analysis of religion world-wide. For Instance, did you know that the destiny of many nations has been </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Taste and See ...” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font3">possible for us, the full-time service should be our goal.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The servants of God today are found in the following groups: (1) those in full-time service, or pioneers; (2) those for whom the Lord makes allowance because of Scriptural obligations, or company publishers; (3) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">those who could be in the pioneer service, but are not.</span><span class="font3"> In which of these categories do you find yourself?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> A “pioneer” is one who converts all that he has into equipment that will aid him in full-time service of praise to Jehovah. He buys a car and a trailer, if he is able to, but if he cannot do that, then he converts what little he has into pioneering equipment, and uses his God-given means of transportation —his two feet. If he has obligations shaped by religion? That once there was only one religion? Do you know how the false kind began? And did you know that communism is a religion, though it denounces religion as the opium of the people? All this information is viewed in the light of the Bible, and hundreds of Scripture texts are used. This book brings forcefully home to us that all religion is now on judgment, and all that Is false will soon perish amid the great ruin that it is bringing upon itself.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The book’s various features can be 'pointed out and demonstrated. A paragraph or two read directly from the book to the person will often arouse interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Use the book itself in overcoming objections. For instance, “I have my religion, and it is good enough for me.” One might reply, “It Is quite natural that you feel that way about it, and that very thought is discussed in this book.” Turn to the index under “Toleration” and read to them the paragraphs referred to, namely, paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 17. Then conclude with the last paragraph in that chapter. Other objections ’can be overcome in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In conclusion, one might say: “This book carries a message of vital importance, appealing to all persons whether they are religious or nonreliglous. Why not take a copy of this book and, along with your Bible, prove for yourself what religion has done for mankind?” beyond that, he gets a part-time job to take care of them. The principle involved here is that he adjusts his life to fulfill his covenant obligations, that of full-time service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Those, however, that find themselves in group three have not fully matured to this point. They are always busy living up to the supposed high standards of this old world. They are interested in having a home, with all the modern conveniences : car, radio, television and luxurious up-to-date furnishings and the like. Most of them have to devote the best part of their life to acquiring and maintaining these possessions. As far as Kingdom service is concerned, they do a little here and there when they can get away from their worldly ties. Being so absorbed in fleshly interests, they can-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Whenever a publisher places a bound book he should have a definite objective in mind. That objective should be the starting of a home Bible study. This can be accomplished only if he is alert and has a ready plan of action in mind. There is no set -time when a Bible study can be started, for prevailing circumstances at the time govern the actual procedure. The following demonstrations are designed to show some of the various times and ways Bible studies can be started.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE ONE: (7 minutes) Publisher starts Bible study while placing bound book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witness introduces himself and new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind f</span><span class="font3"> Interest is aroused and quickened by pointing out that today there are hundreds of religions, while at one time there was only one true religion. Householder is asked if he would like to know when and how false religion began. Showing a desire to know the answer, he is handed a copy of the book. Then publisher demonstrates how book can be used to answer this question.. He asks householder to open it to page 51, and directs his attention to questions at bottom of page. Opening his own copy to same page, he proceeds to demonstrate by regular question-and-answer method when and how false religion began. After a short discussion, arrangements are made to call back for a continued consideration of material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE TWO: Many times a householder will be busy preparing dinner, has company, or is in a hurry to leave for an appointment, etc. An alert publisher will then make arrangements to call later to start a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1 (3 minutes) </span><span class="font3">At Initial contact woman comes to door with appearance of preparing dinner. Alert publisher notes this and briefly states purpose of his call and presents the book. Woman remarks that she is busy preparing dinner and doesn’t have much time to talk, but will take the book. Witness briefly informs her that a free demonstration on some very effective methods of studying book is provided for each person obtaining book, and, since she is busy now, he will call in a week (or when convenient) to give her a demonstration on studying book. Name and address are obtained for return call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2 (5 minutes) </span><span class="font3">At appointed time publisher makes his return call. He informs woman that calling back is part of his service and he would like to spend a few minutes illustrating some effective methods of studying the book. He can then proceed to give question-and-answer demonstration similar to that outlined in first scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE THREE: (5 minutes) Starting studies with those who do not wish to obtain additional literature since they already have some of the publications and have not read them as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When offer is presented householder does not wish to obtain new book, stating he 'has not read any of the other publications obtained previously. Publisher inquires which publication party has, and then asks if he would like to know the best method of study, or perhaps he would like to have the proper method demonstrated to him now. Witness then follows pattern similar to that outlined in scene one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[Note: The first contact need not be an hour in length, but can be limited to 10 or 15 minutes. Circumstances would determine how long this first call should be when contacting a busy person.]</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Taste and See ...” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font3">not do much house-to-house work, or much street work or conduct many Bible studies. Working for all these things will not permit very much time for the Lord’s service. They are in a similar position to the rich young ruler who said to Jesus: ‘I have kept all of the Lord’s commandments ; what yet am I lacking?’ Jesus answered him: “If you want to be complete, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.” That is what Jesus advises for all who are in the same circumstances as the rich young man—full-time service. (See Matthew 6: 25-33 and 1 Corinthians 7:29-31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> Therefore, those who can Scrip-turally do so and who are able to, why not sell all your belongings; that is, convert them into new world life-giving equipment. Then you will be able to feed many more of the poor with the bread of life. Now stop, pause for a moment and reflect. Does your heart rebel at the thought of having to change, disturb or upset your present state and surroundings? Does your flesh resent the call to pioneer service? Remember now, neither of these</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“Continue applying yourself to public reading,” says Paul at 1 Timothy 4:13 (AW), and with the improved ministry school procedure, today’s Christians can prepare for over a year of training in this vital part of their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed, we do read, both privately and publicly. We read the daily text aloud, we read paragraphs and scriptures at our Bible studies, we read when summarizing the paragraphs at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. We are aware of the pressing necessity of reading with understanding, with enthusiasm, with expression. And now, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we are to get long-needed training and experience in the art of reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But this is not the only improvement to be made. Other features have been added to the school that will inject even more life, vigor and interest into it than it already has. Yet it will lose none of its powerful instruction and practical value for all. Get your new schedule and study it.

It should be opened and closed with prayer. The conductor should ask the questions, and then scriptures cited but not quoted can be assigned to various ones to be read. Reading should be done in harmony with paragraph 143 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization. </span><span class="font3">The study should not exceed one hour. If the chapter or portion being studied is concluded before the hour is up, before closing the meeting a few minutes might be used to review material just studied. The conductor should have his lesson</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">studied well, and should make sure all important material is considered. Service announcements should also be made at the end of the study. If, at times, the study conductor is unable to care for this meeting, he should arrange for someone else to care for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With love, kindness and patience, the conductor should give all those attending the study helpful suggestions and examples in presenting the good news. By being friendly he can make everyone feel at home and assist new ones *to get acquainted with the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company book study conductor is appointed by the Society after he has participated in the field service regularly for at least one year after having been immersed. Thus all conductors should be mature brothers and able to carry out their assignment well to feed the Lord’s sheeplike ones- By taking the lead and setting a good example in field service himself, he can be more than just a conductor of a study. He can aid new ones and publishers needing assistance to engage in the field service. He can take them along with him on back-calls and on home Bible studies, showing them how to bring comfort and enlightenment to the honest-hearted in their homes. Yes, as a company book study conductor, one has an important part in Jehovah’s great educational program now being extended to “all kinds of men”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Your New Work Should Be Well Under Way Now</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The “Lightning-War” Testimony Period previously announced for the month of October begins the new fiscal year of the Society. It should bring great joy to the heart of every publisher of The Tiieocbact to share in the opening campaign to which the Lord, by His grace, has brought us. With lightning speed the spreading of the message will go forth to all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the consignments to the companies were shipped out from Brooklyn and the depots by the 15th of September. All companies should by now have received their first order. Pioneer orders that have been received are being given attention. Many of the companies, after receiving their consignments, got right to work with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font3"> as they should have done. Many report that their consignments were put in the hands of the people within three days, one week, or two weeks, and this, of course, brought a flood of telegrams, special deliveries, and air mails, ordering a new shipment. We are trying to give all these orders quick attention. Because of the inrush of orders we shall have manufactured and shipped out by October 1 upward of three-fourths of a million copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font3"> along with the Study Course, and more than four million copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span><span class="font3"> It is a joy to the heart of everyone to see the lightning speed with which the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> is being placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Your Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everyone who claims to be of The Theocracy will go forward as children of the King, aiding the people of good-will to “flee into the mountains”, The Theocracy. We have been supplied with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span><span class="font3"> Some of the publishers may be fortunate enough </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> receive records during October; and when they do, they can use these. All can engage in the magazine work with the new series of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles on Daniel the 11th chapter. Everyone will be anxious to get into the new work with the back-calls and conduct model studies. Door-to-door witnessing will play a prominent part in the “Lightning-War” Testimony Period. The doorstep setup will bring the message to the people quickly and completely. Avoid lengthy presentations of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> to the people. Show them its helpful points in studying. Obtain their names. Send them the course; and follow through with the back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Persons who are too poor or unable to contribute for the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font3"> or even </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn,</span><span class="font3"> leave with them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> No. 9 and a folder advertising your Kingdom Hall, or if they show real interest, leave </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font3"> free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Lightning-Wab” Testimony Period (the name the Lord has given this month's work) has surely been directed by Him, because we are beginning in the fiscal year of work with new instruments, with a message of comfort and one that will truly aid the people of good-will to take a definite stand. The message we have is clear, easy to understand, but as publishers we must do our part, and that will require time, effort, and many back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak In Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up to this time we are not certain whether 70,000 publishers went out into the field in September. You will recall the 15,000 children standing before Brother Rutherford at St. Louis when he said, “Behold, more than 15,000 new witnesses to the Kingdom!” Many of these children are new publishers, and with all of the other publishers who have served in the interests of The Theocracy we should surely reach upward of 70,000 for the first month of the fiscal year 1942. We reached a peak of over 64,000 at one time during this past year. The pioneer peak has gone as high as 4,434. But still there is plenty of room for improvement before we hit that 70,000 mark. Don’t put your personal affairs and business first and neglect the work of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">greatest importance, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy. Have uppermost in your minds the work at hand, this “lightning-war” against the Devil’s organization. (See 2 Timothy 2:4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let each one assist the other members in his family to get out in the work with him. Let every company servant, secretary, and other servants help irregular publishers, as well as the regular, to get out during this one month, October, and make it a new peak for all time. The wise will now take advantage of every opportunity to do with their might what their hands find to do in the service of The Theocracy. Let the “Lightning-Wab” Testimony Period be a real “blitz” against the Devil’s crowd, and to those of good-will bring comfort and joy of heart.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Legal Notice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren writing to the Society concerning arrests have neglected to send in copies of the ordinances or laws under which they are arrested and a copy of the complaint. Always send these in when making your report. A true typewritten copy is preferred, and it need not be certified.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Finest Recordings Yet!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren have been eagerly looking forward to the time when the lectures by Brother Rutherford at the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in St. Louis would be available in record form to play for the people of good-will. We are pleased to announce that very shortly a new series of recordings, including the speeches “Integrity”, “Children,” “Comfort All That Mourn,” “Children of The King,” and “Theocracy”, will be ready for shipment to all parts of the world. It has been stated by those hearing the test records that these are the finest recordings we have ever been privileged to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special order blank has been prepared and is enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> Please use this order blank in ordering the new records. Special rates are made available for a limited period of time, and everyone will w’ant to take advantage of this provision. See order blank for details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every publisher owning a phonograph or having opportunity to use a phonograph should equip himself with the special recording entitled “Children” (P-262). There is no better introduction to the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> than the use of this new record in the doorstep setup. Company servants should check carefully with all publishers to see that all have a chance to obtain one of these discs at the special rate of 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record entitled “Theocracy” is coupled with Part 14 of &quot;Children of The King” Every company or individual publisher having a complete set of the recordings will therefore have one of these. This special disc is to be used on the first back-call after the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course has been mailed. Many publishers have had difficulty in arranging further back-calls, and this new record will aid them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then follow up with “Children of The King”, “Comfort All That Mourn,” and “Integrity”. Companies should have sufficient sets that all publishers may have access to them for their back-calls on new readers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font3"> Any additional discs of “Theocracy” required may be had by companies at 50c during the special offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special rates are being given the pioneers to aid them in the work. The Society will bear the balance of the expense. Also, one disc P-262, “Children,” will be given them free upon request. Please note the information on the Special Order Blank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Stock Up on Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each company should check its stock of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> books. This is one of our most potent instruments now, and therefore all publishers should have a good supply. Each company should try to have in stock no less than ten of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> for each company publisher reporting. Pioneers should have at least one carton of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> on hand. Check your stock and order accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sending In Your Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before sending in your Special Order Blank, check the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you filled in all shipping information?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you enclosed the proper remittance? (Records cannot be shipped without remittance. See instructions on Order Blank.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you checked with all publishers in your company as to whether they personally desire any complete sets or individual discs at this special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you ordered a good supply of records for use in the back-call work by the company?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you ordered sufficient “Children” records for each publisher having a phonograph?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you ordered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> books and other literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is expected that we shall be unable to fill orders for the new records before the 1st of November. Tliis will allow ample time for the company servants to cheek thoroughly with the publishers as to their individual needs. If you need the literature ordered before that time, please so state, and we will make a separate shipment. In no instance do we want any companies or pioneers to run out of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> books. Pioneers should have their orders shipped with company orders or orders of other pioneers in their party when possible.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Pioneer Registration</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>We Are Still Aiming for 7,000</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">There are now enrolled over 5,000 pioneers, 4,434 having reported during the month of August. The other 600 should get started ho later than October 1, 1941. Many more are needed to reach the 7,000 mark. Brother Rutherford, when he greeted the pioneers at the convention in St. Louis, pointed out that they have the greatest privilege in putting in all of their time and energy in the service of Thu Theocracy, and that they are in the front ranks of the fight. The recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> on “Integrity&quot; shows that those faithful men of old listed in Hebrews 11 held fast their integrity by devoting their entire lives to the cause of righteousness, received the Lord’s approval, and died in faith. The faithful servants of the Lord will do likewise now, devoting all the time possible in the Kingdom service, and will eagerly try to arrange their affairs to put in full time if possible. The best way to “pot on mobe steam” is to enroll and work as a pioneer!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Important Campaign Begins</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Our slogan: Three back-calls a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK-ONE OF THEM \ .MODEL STIPY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every publisher must appreciate that in order to accomplish this more time will be required in the field. Brother Rutherford has pointed out many times the need of 60 hours in the field for the company publishers. It is easy to be seen that if the publisher makes 12 back-calls a month his time in the field for these back-calls alone will be upward of 15 hours. Added to that is the time in the field going from door to door and street witnessing with the magazines, which will bring the hours up nearer to our quota of 60 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has helped us. providing the essential instruments with which to work. He gave to us the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course, the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coin fort All That Mourn, </span><span class="font3">and now it is announced that about October 15 the new recordings, “Children of The King,’’ &quot;Comfort All That Mourn,” and “Integrity”, will be ready for our use. Additionally, the new records “Children” (P-262) and “Theocracy” (P-292) are ready and have a special place in our service to The Theocracy. We must learn to handle these instruments skillfully and effectively if we would be pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Arranging Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each publisher should fully appreciate that he can’t make back-calls unless he does door-to-door witnessing and places the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book. Then the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book is followed up with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">then your work begins in earnest with hack-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In your door-to-door work, after you receive the new records, you will introduce the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book with the “Children” record. On your first back-call you will Introduce your back-call activity with the record “Theocracy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On your first back-call run the record “Theocracy&quot; and then answer any questions that the reader of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> may have had and try to direct his attention the first evening to the record series you have. Until you receive the new records, use the latest series in stock and continue as outlined below, substituting other records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following will be the general procedure for many months to come:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First week—Place the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children. </span><span class="font3">Second week—Numb it 1 Study folder is mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Third week—Number 2 Study folder is mailed. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fourth week—Number 3 Study folder is mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fifth week—Your first back-call; starting the back-call with “Theocracy” record (P-292) ; answering a few questions ; and running the series “Children of <sup>r</sup>l’he King”. Sixth week—Second back-call;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">answering a few questions for five or ten minutes; then run “Comfort All That Mourn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Seventh week—Third back-call; answer questions; run series “Integrity”. Take persons of good will to nearest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> study, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, and service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eighth week—Begin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model tsludy </span><span class="font3">No. 1, No. 2. or No. 3, choosing the one that answers the many questions uppermost in the mind of the person of good-will. Continue this model study as long as it seems advisable, but always direct the person’s attention to the local book study and Kingdom Hall model study, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">study, and service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our desire is io aid the people of good-will to take their places in the Theocratic organization, and that means directing them to the company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be sure to take with you on each of your back-calls the new 64-page magazine, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Jehovah’s witnesses Asscnibly.</span><span class="font3"> Place one with the person of good-will on a contribution of 5c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After these people of good-will have been given attention for more than eight weeks, it would be proper Io speak to them about field service and taking the message of the Kingdom to their neighbors and friends. Let them go with you on some of your other back-calls or model studies. Bring them to the meetings. Introduce them to our brethren. Take them with you from door to door and teach them the use of the doorstep setup. Have the company servant furnish them vvitli the testimony card if they become regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Time Occupied</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An energetic publisher of The Theocracy, si (ending fifteen to twenty hours </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">li</span><span class="font3"> month in regular door-to-door work, will place in a month anywhere from ten to twenty bound books, and this means that in his territory he will have numerous back-calls to make. If all publishers of The Theocracy- really devote themselves to this new work, iio publishei’ will be able to get assistance in his back-call service, and we hope it is this way; but many of the newly interested ones, not yet seeing the privilege of putting in so much time, might wish to help others in evenings on their hack-calls. Let them take a few and help you, and finis get them started in the right way. Parents should be anxious to take with them their children who are able to operate the phonograph and change records, so that. If it becomes necessary in the same evening to make two back-calls in your territory, you can leave the child at one home, after you have introduced the child, to run the phonograph and records, and then you make another call with another phonograph and records at another home near by. Thus your child vill be helping the people of good-will and share in the back-call work. The Lord, since the convention, has opened up many avenues for the children to get in time in the field. The child devoted to the Lord will take hold of these opportunities and will receive from the Lord a rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Hall Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Believing that every company publisher will be more than anxious to follow out the above schedule of tile three or more back-calls on each reader of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font3"> the time should come when the work will be too great for the publishers to handle all the model studies, and therefore each company should arrange to have a model study series running at their Kingdom Hall by December 1, beginning with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study No.</span><span class="font3"> 1. Details on this series will be explained later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are faced with the need of doing a bigger job than ever before in a limited amount of time. Long hours of Kingdom activity are neces-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>One Million Magazines a Month Our Goal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">It is hoped that by this time every publisher of The Theocracy will be taking a regular part in street witnessing with the magazines. We can see no reason why 100 percent of the publishers should not be engaging in this phase of the Kingdom work each week. If you have not yet witnessed with the magazines on the streets, you are voluntarily withholding yourself from one of the most important parts of the &quot;strange work” and also depriving yourself of a rich blessing at the hands of the Lord. Information published continually in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> is vital to the people, and upon the witnesses of Jehovah rest the responsibility and privilege of placing it before the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is suggested that those pub</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report of the Jehovah’s witnesses Assembly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Send In Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A report of the joyous activities of Jehovah's servants at the recent assemblies at St. Louis, Missouri, and Leicester, England, has been compiled. It is a wonderful witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name, and should have a wide distribution. It is a very pictorial report, printed in magazine form, and contains 64 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rates</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year the convention report is made available at only 5c a copy. Those ordering 11 or more copies to one address may have them at only 4c per copy. In all instances remittances in full must accompany the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The value of this report should not be overlooked. All publishers will read it with keen interest, but it should have a much wider distribution. Therefore the following methods will be used:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls: Every person known by jou to be interested in The Theocracy should be offered a copy at 5c. It will be of particular interest to those who have the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">and who have heard the convention lecture records. Show them the pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Doob-to-Door : Garry copies with you for regular witnessing and offer with the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SniEET Corners: A special week will be set aside I to be announced later) for general distribution on the street corners and business establishments. Groups should be arranged daily during this period for this distribution, both during the daylime and in the evenings. Everyone should join in this special effort to inform the people concerning the Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sary, and as many back-calls as you can possibly arrange should be made, using whatever records you now have on hand until the new series arrives. That you are now short of these new records should not retard our work with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> or the Study Course and our back-call activity. During this fine autumn weather and the long winter nights many should be the opportunities of the publishers to increase the activity in their new work to a point of 60 hours a month and 12 back-calls a month. lishers who do street witnessing make arrangements with others who have not and take them with you the next time you go out. Aid those in your study group to be regular in street witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Saturday afternoon and evening and one other night during the week should be set aside for magazine witnessing, thus affording an opportunity for every publisher to participate sometime each week. If your company turns out 1(10 percent and every company throughout the country does the same, millions of people each week will be spoken to by the magazine workers. Jehovah's witnesses will, by the Lord's grace, put out 1,00(1,009 magazines in this manner during each month. Let’s put on more steam while we yet have the freedom to openly and publicly give a witness for the Theocratic Government of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Send in your orders now, including those for the publishers and general distribution, with remittance. Do not underestimate your needs. Order a liberal supply. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Jehovah's witnesses Assemhly</span><span class="font3"> will be very effective throughout the coming year on all back-calls, and it ■would be well for all companies to carry some in stock. The people of good-will will enjoy seeing pictures of the site of the lectures they have heard and facts presented in connection therewith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Society has printed one </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course for each book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font3"> Packed with each shipment of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> books you receive an equal number of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course. When you receive a shipment of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> books, say 56, you will also receive 56 copies of each of the three folders, 168 envelopes, 56 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course Order slips and 56 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children-</span><span class="font3"> Back-Call Reminder slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> Study Course has been prepared for each </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">book printed, please do not order any extra supplies of the Study Course. These cannot be supplied. Take care of your shipments properly. keep the material clean, and there will be no occasion to order extras.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Suggestions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pioneers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers are to make separate orders for their individual stock. Do not send in one order with a notation at the bottom saying “Charge one-third to each of the three following pioneers”. In the future all such orders will be returned for correction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneer sisters should use the name they put on their application form consistently when corresponding with the Society. If you signed your application “Mrs. John Smith”, use that name right along. Do not sign &quot;Mary Smith&quot;, because we will have no record here of &quot;Mary Smith”, but will have a record of “Mrs. John Smith”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers should be careful to send in their change of address promptly. No replacements of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Consolation</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Info) mailt</span><span class="font3"> will be made in the future. Therefore it is important that they go to the proper address when originally sent out.</span></p>

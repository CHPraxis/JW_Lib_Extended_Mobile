<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Will All Your Company Publishers Be in the Field?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">During the entire montli of June it is tne privilege of all the Lora's people to participate in the “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period. Are you ready for this special event? If you are a Theocratic ambassador and have been giving serious consideration to this matter since it appeared in the May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> you are ready.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What does it mean to be ready? The “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period is a month during which the Lord’s people are going to make available to the public the Kingdom message in bound-book form, on a contribution of 35c for three in English (excepting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion),</span><span class="font2"> or 40c for three in any foreign language (excepting the latest bound book in such foreign language). In getting ready for such a campaign the following points should be observed:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1.</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Time. Plan now and determine the time you are going to devote to this service during the montli of June, designating the days and evenings you intend to go out, and adhere to that schedule strictly. Do not permit anything to interfere with it. Theocratic responsibilities come before everything else.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2.</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Territory, individual and group assignments should be arranged for, so that you will have some territory to work in at all times. Survey the territory between now and June 1. Know where you intend to work during the daytime and in the evenings. Arrange your back-call names and good-will interest so that they can be reached and witnessed to in the least possible time. Plan to do a thorough job, so that all who show any interest are given an opportunity to get tills special bound-book offer, either to complete what are missing of their present Theocratic library or to obtain an entire set.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3.</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Equipment. See that you have plenty of bound books. The May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> suggests at least 9 books for each publisher. Most publishers will place many more than that. According to your faith and your faithfulness be it unto you. Have your phonograph introductory record and back-call slips ready. When you go in group witnessing know the car and the party with which you are going. Have all arrangements completed in advance, so that there won't be any waste of time when the campaign actually begins. If all these details are taken care of in advance it will do much toward making the campaign a success.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the evening work in June an arrangement will exist similar to that which we are carrying out during May. The publishers will first cover the territory with the three-booklet combination, but it would be well to have 3 bound books along, too; someone may want them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Evening work has been found very effective for the distribution of booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Know vViiiit you &lt;ii'c to Sciy and say it brielly and distinctly. It is difficult to get into many of the restricted apartment buildings, particularly witli the phonograph or conspicuous brief cases. Go neatly dressed and as inconspicuous as possible. State your business to the party answering at the door, then immediately flash your combination of 3 booklets, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State, Theocracy,</span><span class="font2"> and another booklet. Mention the contribution clearly. 1’eople do not grasp at the first statement that all of this literature can be obtained on a 10c contribution; therefore repetition helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By following the above procedure good results are obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two publishers were able to place 300 booklets in 50 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another publisher reports 19 booklets in 2 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two more publishers report 27 booklets the first evening, 2 hours; second evening, 36 booklets in the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They say many are reached by evening witnessing that otherwise could not be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">June has many advantages. It has longer evenings than any other</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Push the “Watchtower” Campaign with Zeal</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>80,000 Received by May 15</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">With 80,739 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions already received at Brooklyn when this article went to press, the goal of 100,000 new subscriptions should be reached, and even exceeded. It will, however, require real effort during the remaining days of the campaign to reach this quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All Theocratic publishers should use every opportunity possible between now and May 31 to obtain another </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription with the special offer. After that all subscriptions will be $1.00 regularly. Perhaps many now have and will yet get promises for subscriptions at the end of the month or at payday, and these may be picked up as late as June 3. All subscriptions should be in this office by June 15, and none should be taken with the premium offer after June 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From our records it is evident that many of tiie brethren have not yet subscribed for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The ’Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> on the yearly basis. If you are one of these, we again call to your attention the need of having on record for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine the names of all Kingdom publishers, and advise that all who do not get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtotver</span><span class="font2"> through the mail send in their subscriptions during the special campaign, without fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having well in mind the need for greater and more determined effort as the appearance of “the sign” ap-</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Ranks Growing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The call is now going far and wide for more pioneers. Already hundreds have responded to this call, and the pioneer applications are coming into this office in ever-increasing numbers. In fact, the number of applications received in the first two weeks of May was almost twice the total number of pioneers enrolled in March and April combined. This, again, should be doubled, and redoubled, if we err pect to have 5,000 or more pioneers on the list by August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tiie letter dated May 10, 1941, which is now being sent to all the companies and zone servants, for the publishers’ consideration, again brings forcibly to our attention the pioneer service. This letter should be diligently studied and considered at one of your service meetings this month. Zone servants, pioneers and company servants should in every way assist the brethren to see their privilege of becoming full-time ambassadors of The Theocracy. Do not permit any opportunity whereby you can arrange to be a pioneer publisher to slip by. Our commission from Jehovah is now to proclaim the good news of The Theocracy, and to do this full-time, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare Now for July Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The literature to be used during the month of July will be the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> and one booklet, on a contribution of 25 cents. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> has not had as wide a distribution as it should have, particularly throughout the rural sections of the country, and everyone should be given tne opportunity ot obtaining this vital information. Prepare your rural territories now for a thorough witness during July, using the phonograph and the record “Message of Hope” (P-230). If the people are unable to take the book and booklet, on the 25e contribution, offer three booklets, on the 10c contribution. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> is- not included in the special June offer. Check your stock and order early. Stockkeepers should be able to supply each publisher with five </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font2">books, at the very least, during the month of July. If phonograph records are needed, order those with your supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Suggestion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In localities where the brethren find it difficult to procure legal counsel to handle their cases on appeal, because of prejudice or the unwillingness of attorneys to represent them at a reasonable cost, we suggest that the brethren so involved write the American Civil Liberties Union, 170 Fifth Avenue, New York City, informing them of the date of the trial, with request that the American Civil Liberties Union provide them with counsel of that organization free of charge or at a reasonable cost, or inform them of the name of an attorney willing to handle the case at a reasonable cost, and send copy of such letter to the Legal Desk of tiie Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This, of course, does not alter the advice for Kingdom publishers to keep the Sociely informed as to all arrests and developments, and for j the brethren to defend themselves I witiiout counsel in the police courts.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">month in the year, enabling the publishers to put in two or more hours of service before it gets dark. Daytime activity, of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">course, i« to </span><span class="font2">be devoted exclusively to the distribution of tiie 3 bound books, having some booklets along where people manifest interest but cannot afford to take tiie bound-book combination. Present to such the 3-booklet offer.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">ee'V» the literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Follow out the details contained in the May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> concerning transferring books and adjusting your stock locally. If this cannot be done, then immediately order from the Society such books as you require. Get a good supply: this campaign will surprise you. The Brooklyn depot has a good supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Government, Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font2"> 1, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication 1,2,3, Preservation, Preparation, Jehovah, Riches,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> At the end of the month of June, when you submit to the Society your report card covering the month’s activity, ask for credit. A credit allowance of 25c will be given to the companies for each boundbook combination placed, in English or foreign languages. There is no credit allowance for pioneers, due to the low rate at which they reproaches, every one devoted to the great Theocrat will use his entire strength in the climax of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Walch-tower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign and continue thereafter to push every phase of the Kingdom work until the Lord says that it is enough. Always be on tiie alert to take subscriptions at any time from people who show interest in The Theocracy. Many subscrip-iions can be obtained by reading to them parts of the current articles, such as “Noah’s Day” and “The Ideal Government”, in (he May 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Talk </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">and you will get the subscriptions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The 52,912 publishers engaging in the field on tlie average every month shows a decided increase over that of the previous year, there being 8,988 more publishers going out in the field on the average every month. However, there are still many irregular publishers in the country, and if these would appreciate their privileges of service and begin in the field work during June, we would undoubtedly reach and greatly surpass the high peak of J une 1010. namely, 58,009, which since then to this time lias never been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those publishers who have been constant in the field service have put in 1,300,000 more hours than the publishers of last year during the same period. A splendid increase in new subscriptions is shown, as well as great activity in the street-corner witnessing with the magazines. If all the publishers throughout the country see their privileges in the magazine work we shall soon be putting out well over half a million magazines every month.</span></p>

Every pioneer, company publisher, and company itself should strive diligently to increase the efforts put forth as the time grows short in the proclamation of the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font2">The report for Ajiril set out below shows that more brethren are engaging in the field work than in the previous month, and that in April, us far as this year is concerned, we reached a new high of 57,494 publishers in the United States; but this is not a new all-time peak. We hope that every publisher that was out in April will go out in June, and several thousand more, so that, June will really demonstrate that we are the Theocratic ambassadors. In June last year we reached our peak of 58,009. Nothing should stand in the way of reaching a new peak this June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Memorial attendance for the United States was 60,629; those who partook of the Memorial emblems, 13,771. We rejoice to see so many of the “great multitude’’ now associated with the remnant and fighting in tlie King's interests. Krom the i above figures it appears that almost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font2">everyone attending the Memorial was a publisher. Rejoice and press on witli the great work at hand.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Increases Your Hours</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Would you like to put in a few hours in the service some afternoon or evening and bring the Kingdom message to the attention of hundreds or even thousands of people? All Theocratic publishers would jump at the opportunity, but they might wonder just how they could witness to that many people in so little time. The answer is easy. Here's how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you can stand on your feet for two hours at a time, you can accomplish the far-reaching witness mentioned above. Every publisher already taking part in tlie street witnessing with the magazines is doing that very thing; but how many are missing this excellent opportunity of reaching so many people In so short a time and with a minimum of effort? Reports show that the street witnessing with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> is accomplishing a marvelous work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A further aid to street publishers will be the new cover arrangement on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> Magazine publishers can use the main subjects printed in large type on the front to announce the magazine to the people as they pass by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Persons Become Interested Because of Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many people we meet while going from door-to-door comment on our street advertising, and these remarks open the way for further explanation of The Theocracy and the placement of additional literature which would have been impossible were it not for the magazine work on the streets. Many persons will take a magazine or other publications from the publisher at the door, whereas they wouldn’t from one on the street. In larger cities where hundreds of people live in hotels and highly restricted apartments, and cannot be reached ordinarily, the publishers can reach these people by Inking an active part in the magazine street work. (See March 1940 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span><span class="font2"> If it were only for the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">fact that we were keeping the names &quot;Watchtower’’, “Consolation” and &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses” constantly before the people, the street witnessing would still be invaluable in its part of the “strange work”. However, it is doing much more than that, and it is causing a wider gulf between the “rich man” and the “Lazarus” class.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Unlimited Possibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are also unlimited possibilities in witnessing with the magazines in the route work because of the repeated calls made with persons manifesting interest in the Kingdom work. Continuous attention to these meek ones aids them to see the importance </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> learning God’s instructions for man. Many back-calls may be arranged with such persons, and model studies started. Possibly the publisher could use his spare time each week in covering his territory witli the magazines in order to build up </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font2"> route and in this manner become thoroughly acquainted with all in his individual territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many companies have found it profitable to build up routes in the business sections, in addition to the regular street work. The i&gt;ublisher visits each place of business and approaches the manager and clerks with the magazines, preferably at a time when they are not very busy, and then keeps track of those places where magazines are left. This is followed up regularly with each issue of the magazine, also working those stores where no prei ious placements have been made, in an effort to add to the route. The work should not be done in a haphazard manner, but the advertising servant should assign certain portions of tlie business section to each publisher for magazine work only, and these publishers will see to it that regular calls are made. Anyone not having an assignment must not work Ilie business places, but confine his activity to the people on the streets.</span></p>

'Tlie local officials should lie advised that if they continue arrests they will be enjoined in Federal Court, as in &quot;LAW-ABIDING&quot; leaflet ami as is now done in many other States.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">I Try this in your terrilory and in-I crease your magazine placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Especially at this time, publishers can make many more opportunities for obtaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions by regularly engaging in the street work and in witnessing from door-to-door with the magazines in getting routes established. Where you find interested persons who are unable to subscribe, make note of them and include them on your magazine route. The better weather ahead will also be an aid to the Kingdom publishers as they go ahead with renewed zeal and determination to share in this blessed work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be well for the company servant and the advertising servant to go over the activity of the company witli respect to the magazine work and take steps to increase the distribution of magazines in the company territory by encouraging all publishers to have a regular part in street and route witnessing. This will mean more hours, placements, back-calls, model studies, and, finally, more people declaring themselves openly for Jehovah God and his Theocratic government.</span></p>

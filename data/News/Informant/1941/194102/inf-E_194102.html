</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Peak of Publishers Should Be Reached During “The Sign” Testimony Period, in April</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> read regularly by persons of good-will, is the most complete form in which the message of The Theocracy can be placed in the hands of the people. By the Lord’s grace tliis </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign will be the greatest yet in the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How can this be accomplished? The drama of “Ehud”, which we have so much enjoyed, brings some very timely suggestions to the mind of each publisher of The Theocracy. Ehud made preparation, and had courage and speed, and was accurate in his work. He had zeal for the Lord’s cause and righteousness and, above all, unity in action to the advancement of the kingdom interests. Jehovah gave Ehud a job, and he set out to fulfill his commission. He obtained the necessary equipment, the sword, picturing God’s word of truth. He kept it on. At tlie proper time he used it, and without hesitation he drove that weapon to its mark straight and true. The same thing is required of every person today if he would receive the approval of Jehovah and His rich blessing. This means no time wasted. Every moment of time possible must be devoted to the Kingdom service. We see on every side practically every nation of the Devil’s organization closing down the Lord’s work, except England and the United States. The attaining of any great quota this year depends almost wholly upon the publishers in these two countries, and primarily the Theocratic servants in the United States. What are you going to do? Are you going to make this the greatest year ever in the witness of the Kingdom? By the Lord’s grace it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A very special offer is made by the Lord’s people at this season of the year, namely, a year’s subscription for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine, 24 issues, and giving free a bound book and a booklet to each person who subscribes. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion. </span><span class="font2">will be used primarily, but if anyone has it he can have his choice of any of the other publications. The same is true of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span><span class="font2"> Have in mind always to first present to the people at the door the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine on a dollar contribution. Do not drop too quickly to the bound book and booklet on a contribution of 25c, nor to the 3 booklets on a contribution of 10c. Remember that during this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign the objective of each publisher of The Theocracy should be that of obtaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, and to aid in doing this use the phonograph and doorstep setups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be well for each publisher to refer to the November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> on how to make these setups with greater efficiency. Use the special </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> record “Instruction” in introducing this magazine in this special offer. Have with you the Testimony Card, which has been consigned to.all companies. Learn to talk subscriptions now, and keep it up for three months. Remember that during this campaign if you meet a person who is already receiving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> he may obtain the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> magazine on the same terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each Publisher Should Be a Subscriber</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In checking through the files it is found that many brethren are no longer regular </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers but they obtain their copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoioer</span><span class="font2"> from the advertising servant, getting it from the distributors’ supply. At tills time it is essential and to the publisher’s own interests that his name be on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> files at the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn. If you, as a publisher, are not a regular subscriber you should subscribe immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of making back-calls and following along with model studies has always helped the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaigns; and Brother Rutherford has instructed, in his letter of January 8, 1941, “Wherever in, terest is shown, fall not to arrange for a back-call.” The more hours that we put in the field, the more back-calls we will make and the greater will be the distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> during 1941. The following table is interesting in that it shows the number of new subscriptions received at the Brooklyn office from all over the world during the special campaigns with magazines during tire past three years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1st 2nd 3rd I&gt;th month month month month </span><span class="font2">1938 &nbsp;15,233 &nbsp;21,510 &nbsp;19,352 &nbsp;16,911</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1939 &nbsp;17,928 &nbsp;19,085 &nbsp;22,539 &nbsp;17,855</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">.1940 &nbsp;11,745 &nbsp;15,088 &nbsp;15,631 &nbsp;&nbsp;9,144</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We feel certain that with more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">than 50,000 publishers regularly engaged in the service these records can be beaten each month without any difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Campaign Will Gain Momentum</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">February may be a cold, hard month in which to work, but we hope that at least 50,000 publishers will be engaged in the field service with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span><span class="font2"> As spring comes on conditions will be somewhat better and more of the brethren will be able to get into the field and, without question, should be able to put in more time. The Lord’s people are not looking for good weather and for better conditions under which to work, because we know that eventually conditions may be far worse than they are now, and as long as we have work to do and are assigned by the Lord to do it we must go ahead; but in this campaign beginning with “Ehud’s Sword” Testimony Period we may naturally expect that as the days, weeks and months go by greater momentum and force will be backing this campaign, not only in the increased hours put in the field work, but in the number of back - calls made, model studies begun, use of the records “Religion” and “The End”, more book studies organized, and more publishers coming into the field organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By April, at which time we will celebrate the Memorial, the greatest number of publishers in the field for 1941 should manifest themselves. At that time were will be an added incentive to press on with the battle, in the two new booklets written by Brother Rutherford. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy </span><span class="font2">will be released for the first time. Right along with it comes another new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">God and The State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In April the special offer will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription, with a book and these two new booklets, on a contribution of one dollar; dropping to the book and two booklets on a 25c contribution, and finally, if these offers are not taken, to three booklets on a 10c contribution or either one of the new ones on a 5c contribution. Consignments are now being made to companies, so that all the publishers of the Kingdom will be supplied. So that the publishers will be equipped, the presses at Brooklyn are running extra time in order that these two new booklets can be released simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a witness against the Devil’s organization! and what a joy to the Lord’s people in hammering home the truth I The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">campaign Is not one that becomes easier as time goes on, but one more strenuous right up until the end, culminating with “The Sign” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In times past the Society set a quota for all the world. 100,000 new subscriptions, and placed over a million bound books and 12 million booklets. In view of so few reports coming in from nearly all parts of the world now it seems advisable to change this quota and set one for the United States alone, where we still have freedom to move ahead in the proclamation of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A three-month quota for each company publisher should be 3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, 15 bound books, and 90 booklets. Pioneers should set their quota much higher, due to the fact that they put in many more hours; namely, a three-month quota of 21 subscriptions, 120 bound books, and 750 booklets. By the Lords grace and an extraordinary effort put forth by the servants of The Theocracy during February, March and April, we might expect to place in the United States at least 100,000 subscriptions for the magazines, one million bound books, and 6,750,000 booklets. This will mean a diligent effort on the part of every publisher. And you will note a change from January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> in your individual quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How to Handle Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When you take a subscription for a magazine, always remember that the name of the publisher and the name of the company should appear on each subscription slip that is sent to the Society. The subscriptions should be sent in to the office at least once a week, with the remittance. A Subscription Record Sheet should accompany these subscription slips. The secretary or one assigned to look after this work should be careful to check each subscription slip, see that it is written plainly, and address is correct, and also check the Subscription Record Sheet, so that no errors will be made. In this way time will be saved and complaints be reduced. The company should also keep its records complete and accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Distributors' Copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers, in order to carry on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign properly, will need plenty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazines. Therefore you should be sure that you are ordering a sufficient supply of distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> It is noted that approximately 300 companies in the United States are not listed among our distributors for magazines. Either they do not appreciate the need of this campaign or they have failed to make proper remittance on their magazine account. Remember that the one handling distributors’ magazines on behalf of the company is responsible to see that proper contributions are received for the magazines and that remittance is macle to the Society in the proper manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company servant and other servants in the Theocratic organization should check carefully to see that everything Is now running in smooth order; that is, that all publishers are supplied with subscription slips so that a copy can be left with the subscriber and the original turned in to the secretary for proper handling as described above; that phonographs are put to good use; plenty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> books on hand; that publishers have the “Instruction” record for the doorstep setup; that there is a sufficient supply of sample copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">for street-corner work, routes and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford Writes Comforting Letter</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Study Organization Necessary</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Following These Instructions Means a Blessing to You </span><span class="font2">Recently Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 8, addressed “To the Servants of The Theocracy”, was forwarded to all companies, pioneers, zone servants and regional servants, with additional copies to the companies so that it could be considered in detail at the service meetings and read at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and other appropriate studies. This letter should be considered point by point at the service meeting. It should be carefully studied and applied to each company’s local circumstances and service requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most effective way to consider this would be to schedule one point for each service meeting, which would cover- a series of five service meetings. A brother should be assigned to take up the matter in detail, discuss it with the company, and carefully cheek and see to what extent the company is delinquent in the particular features with which he is dealing, and consider ways and means of overcoming such weakness</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Publishers Have Best Month</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5,090,835 Books and Booklets Placed in December</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah in his goodness and mercy arranged for seven booklets to be placed on a contribution of ten cents during the month of December. Publishers of The Theocracy saw the advantage of placing as many of these in the homes of the people as was possible, and therefore the month of December was one of the best months we have ever had. AVe did not reach a peak in publishers, but for December we had the highest number ever engaging in the field service at that time of the year, namely, 53,879. There were 3,844 pioneers (which includes the special pioneers and zone servants), and these brethren placed approximately 2,060,000 booklets. Had they reached their quota of 1.000 booklets each it would have been considerably better. 50,035 company publishers placed approximately 2,940,000. Company publishers were a little under their quota of 70 booklets per i&gt;ublisher. However, this is the finest month we have ever had in the distribution of booklets. AVe look forward with joy to the coming months and press on with the work, and will have the pleasure, shortly, we hope, of sur</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Mailing of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Informant is sent as first-class mail so that the information contained therein will be given to the company organization only. So as to save on postage we never mail a company more than one ounce. Small companies do not require as many copies of the Informant as larger companies: therefore, to companies where there are 1 to 5 publishers we mail 1 Informant; 5 to 15 publishers we mail 3 copies of the Informant. Companies of 16 to 30 publishers receive 5 copies. All the larger companies arc mailed 8 copies of the Informant. When it becomes necessary for the Society to send a letter or some other information in the same envelope, an Informant is omitted, to save postage, thus making it 7 copies to the larger companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two copies of the Informant should always be kept in the permanent files: one in the files of the company servant and one in the files of the secretary. Two of the other copies of the Informant can be cut up, giving the various articles to the various servants to whom they apply. The main point of the Informant as discussed at service meetings should be given to study conductors to use at the book studies and the Watchtower meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is essential that all associated with the company attend the serv</span><span class="font2">es. In addition to taking it up in this manner at the service meeting it should be read periodically at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies and at the book study centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of the Lord’s people undoubtedly have by this time finished a careful study of the 1941 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font2">and have been able to see the very important part that book studies have played in maintaining the interest and continuing organized activity in the many countries throughout the earth where prohibitive legislation had been enacted against our work and where war conditions made it extremely difficult to maintain any semblance of organized activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society’s recommendation that book studies be established throughout each company’s territory is again forcibly called to our attention in Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 8. It is importtint, therefore, that each company should immediately organize these book study passing all our previous all - time peaks set out below, four of which are of more than eight months’ standing. Let’s change them soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">British Brethren Worked Harder</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our British brethren, despite air raids, a severe winter, and difficulties from every side, did much better than those in the United States during the December, “Courage,” Testimony Period. 9,18.8 publishers placed 1,357,342 books anil booklets. Had the publishers in the United States worked as hard as our brethren in England, that is, put in as many hours proportionately, the United States placement of booklets would have been over eight million. In the United States we do not have blackouts, air raids, war restrictions; we have greater freedom — </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">let's go Io work.</span></p>

A study conductor will be assigned to these studies by the Society. The acceptance of such an appointment indicates that this study conductor accepts the privilege of conducting the study and assuming the responsibility for the territory that will be assigned to that study and that he will see to it that arrangements are made to keep those attending the study acquainted with the service work in that area, take them into the field and properly look after the back-call interest, as outlined in a previous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">and in the “Amendments to Organization Instructions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reason that the Kingdom service was carried on successfully in many countries throughout the earth during the past year is that these arrangements were definitely established by the companies before their activity was circumscribed. It behooves the Lord's people in this country to profit by this lesson and make the necessary preparations now for any such emergency that might arise in this country in the future.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Booklets Released in April</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Sign” Period Should Find AU People of Good-Will Engaging in the Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford lias recently furnished us with two new booklets. This is no time to slow down on the witness work, but plan for greater activity than at any time heretofore. &quot;Tlie Sign” Testimony Period is the third month of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, and it is at that time that the new 64-page colored-cover booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font2"> is released for the first time. Along with this comes another 32-page booklet, selfcovered, entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(tod and The State. </span><span class="font2">The messages contained in these booklets are of great importance and should be put in tlie hands of all persons of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beginning April 1 the campaign offer will be the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchdower</span><span class="font2"> magazine (for one year), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font2">also two booklets, on a contribution of one dollar. If you do not take a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription, then </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> and two booklets, on a contri</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font2">samples in tlie field; and all the other requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord in his goodness and mercy has seen to it that a proper witness for The Theocracy is given to tlie people throughout the earth, and it is our joy, and we esteem it a great privilege, to honor the Lord's name at this time. Unity of action is very essential. Brother Rutherford's letter of January 8. 1941, emphasizes this point: “There must be complete unity among the servants of the Lord. There must be harmonious action, each one being diligent to quickly comply with organization instructions. Anyone causing or attempting to cause dissatisfaction or trouble gives evidence that he is not of God's organization. The greatest opportunity ever given to creatures is now to work together under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Let us, therefore, go forward in this great work placing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">in as many homes as \.e possibly can, and reach our quota in subscriptions, books and booklets. This can be attained if we reach our quota in hours in Ilie field and back-calls. Let us work while we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklet No. 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is pleased to announce that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> No. 3, covering the lectures “Religion” and “The End”, is now available for all persons interested in The Theocratic Government. It is a 32-page booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All who heard these talks during the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses or who have heard them since in recorded form will appreciate the questions and answers on these two subjects and profit greatly by the study thereof. In considering Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 8, all publishers vill appreciate as never before the necessity of making back-calls and starting model studies with people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has graciously provided this additional food for his people and the privilege of helping others learn of his righteous government. Companies may order the new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> No. 3, now, at the usual rate of 5c per copy, and upon receipt of the same, begin to study it and help others in its study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Once each month the Society sends all companies and pioneers a statement showing<sup>-</sup> the standing of their book account. Those having magazine distributors’ account also receive a statement showing the balance on that account. These statements are valuable, and each company and pioneer should keep a file of statements for reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneers are continually requesting itemized statements of their accounts, particularly the magazine distributors’ account. This should not be. When you receive your statement. check the figures, comparing the invoices received during the month and the number of magazines received, as w^ll us the credits issued; and if satisfactory, file it for future reference. If companies and pioneers properly care for these statements it will be unnecessary to send copies.</span></p>

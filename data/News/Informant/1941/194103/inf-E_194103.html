<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Campaign</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; ... we are now well advanced within ‘die times and the seasons’, hut the ‘sign’ immediately preceding Armageddon is not yet discernible. Until that sign is apparent in every part of *&lt;'liribtendom'. and until every avenue is closed to the giving of testimony openly and boldly, the remnant and the ‘other sheep' . . . must continue to sound out the message of the great Theocrat and his government under Christ Jesus the King. This must be done to the name of Jehovah God and that those who are of good-will might find the way of escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With those thoughts in mind, from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Walehtoirer</span><span class="font4"> relative to &quot;The Sign”, which name identifies the special Testimony Period during April, Jehovah's witnesses push ahead in Ilie third month id' the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchlou er</span><span class="font4"> Campaign featuring a year’s subscription lor the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wuteh-toircr</span><span class="font4"> magazine at the regular contribution of $1.00 a year, with a free copy of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">h’eliaion</span><span class="font4"> and of Brother Rutherford's two new booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theociueii</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God mill the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s Provisions for Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again the Lord lias graciously provided his Theocratic publishers with added equipment, and instead of offering the people a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Walehtoirer,</span><span class="font4"> with a book and a booklet free, we can now offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Walehtoirer.</span><span class="font4"> 1he book, and two brand-new booklets, on a contribution of $1.00. The fact that there is no better message, and surely no better offer, to bring to the people should be emphasized to every person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having in mind the three-month quota of 100,000 new subscriptions, 1,000,000 bound books and 6,750,000 booklets for the United States, early reports indicate that we are behind in our quota for subscriptions, only 9,000 having been received at the time this went to press. Each company publisher and pioneer has his individual quota to work for. and should know how well he is doing. AU of these individual quotas ultimately make up the quota for the United States; therefore each Theocratic publisher has his part in making this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchlou er</span><span class="font4"> Campaign successful. Have you reached your quota? or will you? Tf not, carefully consider some of the following ways which may help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Get Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first thing necessary is to put in the time and put forth diligent effort with the special offer. The second tiling is to talk </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> at every home, that is, the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">mine Ilie circumstances of the person to whom they talk, but rather should keep in mind llial they are mil to place fl </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">alchloirer</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, above any!liing else, and that unless they tell the people about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Waleh-louer</span><span class="font4"> at SI.00 a year, with the free book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ifelii/ion</span><span class="font4"> and the Iwo new booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theoeraeii</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God ami the Stale,</span><span class="font4"> the person will not know that such a wonderful offer is available. We feel sure, as past experiences have shown, that the publishers who consistently talk this offer at every door and to everyone they meet will get more than their quota of subscriptions, hooks and booklets. Try it !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Points to Aid Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After play ing the record &quot;Instruction'' to introduce </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Walehtoirer, </span><span class="font4">many publishers take the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Walchloirer</span><span class="font4"> magazine and point out ‘‘Its Mission” or what &quot;The Scriptures<sup>1 </sup>Clearly Tench”, show the large-size type of tin<sup>1</sup> leading article, point out i the secondary articles, and even , read the opening sentences of the ! main article, or excerpts, which clearly place the mailer before the people Publishers not having a phonograph or not able to carry one may present such outstanding points in connection with the testimony card</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is everyone at lending your model study or book study a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Walehtoirer </span><span class="font4">subscriber?

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Both booklets have been presented to the press of the country. This work has been taken care of by the Society ; so it will not be necessary for the companies to do it. Every newspaper and magazine (not Catholic) has been presented with a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> and of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State.</span></p></li>

There will be no occasion to present this to the Catholics, but the Protestant clergy should have a copy in order that they might see how grossly the Lord's people have been misrepresented.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Months’ Distribution over Seven Million Books and Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first twelve days of January constituted an extension of the December testimony period, wherein seven booklets were offered on a contribution of ten cents, including the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font4"> released for the first time.

<p><span class="font4">Attention is called to Brother Rutherford’s letter of October 2, 1940, which was forwarded to the various company servants, wherein Brother Rutherford strongly urged every member of the company to carefully study the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kinydom Publishers.</span><span class="font4"> Brother Rutherford says, “Not only should each individual be fully acquainted with it, but the company should take it up frequently at studies and discuss the points. The reason is that the time appears to be at hand when ii will be necessary for each one in his own community to present his own defense without the aid of legal counsel.” Quoting again from his letter: “Do not wait until you are arrested to make a study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advice</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each company will see that the city and county officials and the school boards in their respective territory are presented with a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State.</span><span class="font4"> A list of these individuals should be assembled and given to the publishers in the same way that the Protestant clergymen’s names are distributed, and each publisher is to see that those whose names he receives are properly called upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The companies holding the territory in which the state capitols are located will see to it that the members of the state legislature are properly served, and the company in Washington, D.C., will be responsible for seeing that those of the national legislature are served with a copy of this booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Work can start on this as soon as you receive your literature, and should be pretty well cleaned up before the end of March. If there are any state capitals that are not in a company assignment, the zone servant having supervision over the territory in that area is to see to it that some near-by company serves the legislature in that city. This work should be handled very thoroughly and systematically, endeavoring to reach each individual with their copy of the booklet. If, for any reason, the legislature should not be in session, those who are supposed to serve the various ones will try to get the home addresses of the representatives or senators, as the case may be, and see that a copy of the booklet is mailed to their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pany jiublisliers as well as pioneers could have done much better in the number of hours in the field, as will be noted in the table below. We are looking forward to the time when more than 4,000 pioneers will be reporting each month, and well over 56,000 company publishers. In April we should, by all means, hit a new peak of publishers, of no less than 60,000. March brings better weather, less sickness, longer days, and, to many, better opportunities of service. I.et’s look well to the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“The word,” or “speech”, is a comprehensive form applied, not to only one specific message, but to the whole series of messages of truth which Jehovah gave and which he continues to give ever since the lightnings have been flashing from the temple and upon the record of his Word. &quot;The word,&quot; therefore, includes every revelation of truth down to and including the publications </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Re-liyion, Satisfied, Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State,</span><span class="font4"> and whatsoever shall be revealed and published, by the Lord’s grace, as long as the “remnant” is on earth. Hence the importance of getting subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> because through its columns Jehovah is continuing regularly to give “the word” twice a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’The members of &quot;the company” on earth are &quot;great”, but not in themselves. 'Their greatness is by reason of being a part of God’s army, hence &quot;strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might&quot;.—Psalm 68: 11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has given the word, for no other reason than that his devoted people should in turn give it to others. That given “word&quot; includes tlie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reliyion, </span><span class="font4">and other publications, which comprise an especially fine offer for this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch ton'er</span><span class="font4"> campaign now on. Hence, w itli great appreciation of Ilie gilt and the responsibility the receiving of it entails, let us one and all get into this campaign and publish the word to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah foretold he would have a company to do the publishing. If you appreciate the rare privilege of haiing part in tlie publication in fulfillment of the prophecy you will no longer hold back, but will become a publisher at the earliest, during this current </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchloicer</span><span class="font4"> campaign. You will be anxious to do as much publishing as you can, 60 hours a month on the average, if possible. If you can devote your entire time thereto, so much the more favored you are of the Lord, and the opportunity is yours to become a full-time pioneer. In fulfillment of Psalm (IS: 11 we here in this yet democratic land should be attaining the year's peak of publishers, of at least 60,000 and soon our quota of 70,000, especially during April, and from there on go ahead to yet higher numbers of publishers. This should be an &quot;all-out” “blitzkrieg” against the ramparts of religion, for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Memorial a Time of Joy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Announcement of the time for the annual celebration of the Memorial, the feast to the honor of Jehovah and to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, appears in the February 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> This year tlie date is Friday, April 41, 1941, after six p.m. At that time all companies of the Lord’s people will meet together for that purpose. All people uf good-will should be invited to iillend and witness this feast, thus becoming better acquainted with Jehovah’s provisions and his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appropriate seriice announcements should be made by the individual conducting the Memorial, informing those present of the arrangements made for all, both anointed and .Tonailabs, to share in tlie proclamation of Jehovah’s name and Theocratic Government, tlie special offer during “The Sign” Testimony Period (in April), and the time of the local meetings of the company, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, service meetings, and book studies. All should be offered literature, testimony cards, and other equipment necessary to carry forward the work. Have these on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each company or unit should show, on the bottom of the April report card to the Society and zone servant, the total number attending tlie Memorial and the number who partook of the emblems. Pioneers who attend Memorial with companies should make no notation ' on their report cards; but where isolated pioneers meet together, one of them should make such notation. Use the following method: Memorial attendance ............ Number partaking .......... &nbsp;If your company or</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a pioneer attends tlie Memorial service of another company, then state on the bottom of your report card &quot;In attendance with ................ com</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pany” (filling in the name of tlie company).</span></p>

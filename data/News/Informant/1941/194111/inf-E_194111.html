<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Witness Advancing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Work Begins with “Great Multitude” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great campaign as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s letter “To all </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLISHERS FOB THE THEOCRACY” </span><span class="font3">must bring joy and gladness to the hearts of everyone devoted to the Kingdom. This new work is so inclusive that it takes in every representative of The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further effort must be made immediately toward informing the people, to give them an opportunity to become of the “great multitude”. This is our work henceforth, as shown so clearly in this comprehensive letter. In the United States there are more than a thousand towns with population exceeding 2,500 wherein apparently no one resides who is now serving The Theocracy. The people there must be reached; and an effort on our part the Lord will bless, that they may be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning December 1 with the “Great Multitude” Testimony Period, the great campaign outlined begins, and everyone should make careful preparation now to have a share in that campaign and continue therein as long as the Lord will have it so. Arrange your territory as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s letter. Have a good supply of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">book. Mail your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course. Follow through with the new records that will shortly be sent to you. In your door-to-door witnessing use the “Children” record introducing the book. On your first back-call be sure to use the record “Theocracy”. Try to start a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> study just as soon as you possibly can at some central and convenient place for the interested people. Where you find the people very much interested in our work it will not be necessary to wait four weeks, or until after the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Study Course has been mailed out, to make your first back-call, but call each week, a day or two after they receive their study folder, and show them how the study of this book is of real aid to them. Get the study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book started as soon as you can. Other places, where not so much interest is shown on your first visit, let the Study Course do its share, and then make the back-calls with the recordings, having one thing in mind, that the chief purpose is to organize a study group in which study the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book will be used, this to be conducted regularly by you, the publisher. If we keep this purpose in mind at all times, then, by the Lord’s grace, the new work which lie has brought to our attention through the splendid letter by Brother Rutherford will be accomplished to the glory and honor of the Lord’s name and word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">PRESIDENT’S OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">October 24, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To all Publishers for The Theocracy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From and after December 1, 1941, the regional and zone servants will be discontinued and the regional and zone servants will be assigned to the work hereinafter described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Unity ; For some time the Theocratic organization has been operating, and by now all companies have had ample opportunity to be in full harmonious action and able to carry on without the aid of regional or zone servants. The church, including the remnant yet on earth, is now at full unity and everyone should be able to assume and carry out his or her responsible duty without aid from any human creature. Company servants and all other servants of each company know their respective duties, and each one must be diligent to perform such duties fully and faithfully. Everyone in the organization, including the remnant and their companions, has a duty to perform, and each one should lean on the Lord and look to the Loid for admonition and instruction and follow specifically the instruction given at Proverbs 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the days of the apostles, when persecution became great, the then servants of Jehovah were separated and they went everywhere preaching the gospel. (Acts 8: 4) Persecution is now great upon the people of God, and these should follow a similar course. God’s servants are now hated of all the nations in earth, which includes those both of “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”. Each individual servant of God, therefore, must bear his own burden, with the help of the Lord, which help and guidance God has promised and will assuredly give.—Psalm 25: 9. The Work : The “strange work” of the Lord is drawing to an end, and requires haste, with watchfulness, sobriety, and with prayer. Since the organization of God’s people on earth is in good condition, there must be one united, forward movement of all the publishers or workers, because all are engaged in one work of publishing or advertising The Theocratic Government. With full determination to be obedient to the Lord, let these words of the apostle be a guiding slogan: “This one thing I do,” that is, to advertise The Theocracy. Jehovah and His King have put their blessings upon the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book. In less than three months more than a million volumes have been sent forward and placed with the people, and the demand seems to be great. The “other sheep” of the Lord must receive the information, that they may flee to the place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From and after December 1, 1941, the following will be the method of work for all publishers: The phonograph and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book, together with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn,</span><span class="font3"> will be the chief instruments to begin the work. Each publisher being assigned a respective territory will fully and thoroughly work that territory, the chief objective being to organize study classes in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book, to be carried forward systematically until it is deemed wise to use other literature in these studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every home in that territory must be called upon; and for this reason you should divide your territory into small sections and work out each section separately and thoroughly. Do not pass by any house without giving a witness. Introduce yourself by the use of the phonograph record “Children”; exhibit the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book, and the booklet mentioned. Where-ever interest is shown, keep the name and address of each home, and the occupants showing an interest. Say to such: “I will call back in a short time to tell you more.” Then ask: “If a study class is arranged in your neighborhood, would you like to attend? In these perilous times it is very important that the people learn how to protect themselves and their children.” As soon as you have gone over this special division of your territory, prepare to have a study, at same place and time, in a private home that is willing for such study to be held there. Then call back on those who have shown interest and tell them of the time and place of study and invite them to be present. Each publisher will lead the study, as specifically instructed from the office. Proceed with the regular study, hold it once each week, and in the meantime move into another small section of</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Publishers’ Assignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">500 Cities in Starting List Questionnaires Sent to Pioneers Selected</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has gone through the service records of all full-time servants for the past year and has made selection of those pioneers whom we believe to be best qualified to carry on the special publisher pioneer service in cities or towns where now there are no company organizations. These special publishers have been sent a confidential questionnaire and other detailed instructions on how to carry on their work in the city to which they are assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Five hundred cities have been selected throughout the United States in which there are no company organizations, and the Society is sending in two or more pioneers, according to the size of the city. These cities will be covered thoroughly with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book and the records. Study groups will be organized by these special publishers, and as soon as the territory is completed once they will work it a second, a third, and a fourth time, having the one purpose in mind, that of organizing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After covering a town four times, these study groups should be enlarged and companies organized to take on the work of that territory. These special publisher pioneers will then be sent by the Society to another city to do the same work. The questionnaires have been sent to the pioneers who have been selected as special publisher pioneers. As soon as these pioneers send in their questionnaires and express their acceptance of tliis wonderful privilege of service, two special publisher pioneers will be assigned to a city of 4,000 to 8,000 persons, and they will remain there for six months or more, and they will cover the territory at least four times in this period. The larger cities, of 8,000 to 16,000, will be assigned to four special publisher pioneers, so as to cover the territory systematically, quickly and thoroughly, because we must afford an opportunity for all persons of goodwill to become part of the “great multitude”. Special publisher pioneers have a wonderful and great responsibility placed upon them, of pushing forward and making a success of the great campaign which the Lord has now set before His people. As the people of good-will take their stand and join in the field service the special publishers will send in to the Society a field report of their month’s work on a Publisher’s Daily Report slip, along with their special publisher pioneer report, and eventually a company will be organized to carry on the work, after which the special publishers go on to other fields.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies Part in This New Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize Study Groups in Small Towns</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford has pointed out in his letter that this new work will also be carried on by general publishers, which will include all company publishers and all other pioneers not known as special publisher pioneers. In company territories where towns are not assigned to the special publisher pioneers the companies should organize small groups of one to two carloads of publishers to cover a small village or town of 2,000 to 3,000 population, or less, regularly over a period of six months. In other words, every Saturday and Sunday, and probably one or two evenings in the week, these two carloads of publishers will go to this territory, cover it thoroughly, make their back-calls, and organize studies with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book. The Society recommends that one energetic publisher be assigned the town of 2,000 to 3,000 people, and other publishers in the company who wish to work with this brother regularly get an Individual assignment in that town and see that it is worked just as stated in Brother Rutherford’s letter. Each person in a car group should get a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">study started in this small town, and eventually all of these studies be organized into one main study; and finally a company can be organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No longer should companies try to hurry to get over territory, but make a selection of a certain district and cover it time and time again until you have found all the persons of good-will. Do not miss a home; note homes where people are out, and call back later. As has been brought to our attention in Brother Rutherford’s letter as he quotes from Jeremiah, “Behold, 1 will send for many fishers, saith the Loud, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them.” In working these small towns, the near-by rural within one or two miles of the town can also be covered by the company publishers, and probably they can gather into the village all of the interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In companies where there are 40 to 50 publishers or more, special groups should be organized for working outlying towns. One or two cars of publishers, according to the size of the village, should be sent out to this same town every week, to take care of the work there. Do not, however, forsake tlie work in your own town during the week. The publishers who cannot get out to other territories should work energetically in their home city, witnessing in their personal assignments near their homes, making back-calls, conducting book studies, and further carrying out the instructions in Brother Rutherford’s letter, having one thing in mind, to wit, organizing study classes with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the 65,000 or more publishers throughout the entire United States start in in this work beginning December 1 with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, thousands of new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> studies will be organized, millions of back-calls made, and soon, with the Lord’s blessing and favor upon this great campaign, thousands upon thousands more persons of good-will will be associating themselves with the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone and Regional Work Discontinued</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning with December 1, 1941, the existing zone and regional arrangement will be dissolved. The regional servants will make no more visits to zones; the zone servants, no</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">your territory and work it out in a similar manner; and continue thus to do until your entire territory is gone over. By that time you will be ready to go over the same territory again and do it in like manner, as per organization instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publishers: All publishers, whether in companies or otherwise, will be designated as general publishers or special publishers, the latter being those heretofore known as pioneers. The special publishers are selected by the Society headquarters and assigned to their respective territories, where there is now no organization. They will have separate instructions. There have been five hundred towns selected where there is no organized company, and to such places special publishers, otherwise known as special pioneers, will be assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">General publishers will include all company publishers and all other pioneers who have been or may be engaged in the general pioneer work and who have not been selected as special publishers. The method of doing the publishing will be the same with all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Get the testimony of The Theocracy to the people, and organize them into study companies, is the important thing to do. Have in mind the words of God’s prophet: “Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.” (Jeremiah 16:16) The application of this prophecy seems appropriate at the present time. The Lord is gathering His “other sheep” and is giving His faithful servants opportunity to have some part in that blessed work. Seize hold upon and perform your part with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Company Organization : The present organization of all local companies will continue as the same has existed during the past three years. All company servants will be appointed by the Society’s office at Brooklyn. To expedite the selection of local servants each company will name a committee of three brethren, each to be members of the local company, and all of whom must have one purpose in view, and that purpose to advance the Theocratic interest. No selfishness, no personal favoritism or prejudice, must enter into the performance of their duties, and which will be as follows: Every six months this committee will prayerfully and carefully canvass the names of the company members and from this suggest the names of two persons for each place of service in the company, that is to say, two for company servant, and two for each and every other office of servant of the local organization. This list the committee will immediately mail to the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, a duplicate copy thereof to be kept by the secretary of the local company. This list will be carefully considered and, as much as possible, used in the selection of local servants, and then the company will be notified of such appointments. All these appointments will include the leaders of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and other studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Trouble : Personal and company trouble among the members thereof must be avoided. This being the time of unity, no energy or time can be profitably spent in controversies; and certainly controversies cannot be pleasing to the Lord. Dwell together in peace and complete unity. Now is the time when “every man shall bear his own burden”.—Galatians 6: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special Publishers [Pioneers] : These will be assigned their territory by the Brooklyn office. Where territory heretofore assigned to any company is now assigned to the special publishers, the company assignment will be withdrawn from the company and the assignment be exclusively to the special publishers. Two or more special publishers will work together, that is, on the same assignment, and by this means living expenses will be reduced. It will be necessary for the Society to regularly render money aid to these special publishers, as may be required. The Lord will provide this. Special publishers will be required to engage actively in the service not less than 175 hours per month. All company and other publishers will employ all the time reasonably possible in the service. There is much to do, and the time is brief. Be diligent and remain steadfast in your integrity. You are representatives of The Theocracy. In every way special publishers and general publishers must co-operate harmoniously and fully. They are all engaged in a common and glorious cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Organization Instructions : Further instructions will be sent to each company as the same appears to be appropriate. The more detailed instructions will be sent from the service desk at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn. God’s Theocratic organization on earth will work harmoniously and to His glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now, dear fellow publishers, be calm, be sober of mind, walk circumspectly, and let your deportment be in full harmony and keeping with the great Theocratic Government, which it is your privilege to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The righteous governors may soon appear on the earth. The blessings of Jehovah and His King ever attend you. Keep all Theocratic interests in prayer before the throne of heavenly grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow publisher and brother, by His grace,</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting New Studies Started </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Anyone May Conduct Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chief purpose of this great campaign, as has been pointed out by Brother Rutherford, is to organize studies with the use of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book. Each publisher of The Theocracy, whether he be a special publisher pioneer or a general publisher in this great campaign, will carry on in this new work the same way. The publisher will go over his assigned portion of territory with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book, making careful note of those who are interested. If persons are not at home he will make a note of those homes and call back later in the day or on the next Sunday (or other day), but the publisher will not miss a home. In his witnessing work he will try to find some place where an individual will open his home for the study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book. Then invite the interested ones to this central point and proceed to organize the study group. Whether the publisher be male or female, he or she will be permitted to conduct tlie study thus organized until some local person is qualified. Each general publisher employed in this new work (and that should include all) may count time calling from door-to-door, using the phonograph, making back-calls, conducting model studies, and organizing and conducting new study classes. Where an individual begins a study with two or three or more persons and studies the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">book witli them for an hour each week, this time may be counted as field service and reported. Such new study conducted by tlie publisher may be reported as a back-call. Back-Call slips should be turned in, also Back-Call Follow-Up Reports, and a record of these studies be kept by the company on the Study Conductor’s Report slip which is filled out each month by tlie one organizing tlie study and making report to the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As to the special pioneer publishers, they make their reports direct to the Society each month on special forms for this purpose. With this work being opened to all publishers of the Kingdom, great strides should be made in the organization of new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> studies by company publishers as well as by special publishers from one end of tlie country to the other. We should have tlie guiding slogan suggested in Brother Rutherford’s letter, “ ‘This one tiling I do,’ that is, to advertise The Theocracy.”</span></p>

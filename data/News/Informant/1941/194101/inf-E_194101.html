<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied!</span><span class="font3"> That's the keynote for the month of January. Jehovah in his goodness to his people has provided us with this new instrument to go forth in the proclamation of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 1941 Calendar for January says, in the quotation from Psalm 14.1:16: “Thou . . . satisfiest the desire of every living thing.” All creatures who love righteousness and desire to do the will of God and praise him will be satisfied. There are many good people, in all denominations, of every kindred and tongue, who love righteousness and who want to be satisfied. Jehovah is making special provision now so that these people may be fed. Let us do our part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">January Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As is shown at another place in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> the “Courage” Testimony Period is moving ahead with the greatest progress. Servants of The Theocracy are bending every effort to place in the hands of the people the millions of booklets provided for that purpose. Because the work is moving on at such a great pace this campaign is extended up to and including the 12th of January, which gives us twelve more davs, including two week-ends, to present to the people the special offer of seven booklets on a contribution of ten cents. Beginning on January 1 every combination should include </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> and four other self-covered booklets, along with two colored - cover booklets; however, this suggestion is not arbitrary (you may use any booklets you have), but this will be a splendid opportunity to dispose of many of the self-covered booklets on hand. For the first twelve days of January every combination should include </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jiefugees.</span><span class="font3"> By the Lord’s grace we will place another three million booklets In January I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have in mind that the principal purpose of the January campaign is to prepare the territory for February campaign with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">magazine. Therefore the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> should be left at every home in the particular territory you are working where the people will promise to read, most of whom will make a small contribution. The suggestion should be made to the people that five cents may be contributed so that more can be printed and distributed throughout the world. During the first twelve days of January (which is the continuation of the “Courage” Testimony Period) where people contribute five cents, with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> booklet, you can give then! two other self-covered booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Supplied</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the companies are now running low in their stock of booklets, and this information is being sent to you early so that you can replenish your stock if need be from some near-by company. If you cannot get supplies from Brooklyn or one of the depots in time for the work of the first twelve days of January, write your zone servant and see what he can do to get some literature to you from other companies in the zone. If you can’t get any more booklets, then go ahead with all your energy in placing just the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> booklet and prepare your territory for February as all publishers will be doing throughout the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BROTHER RUTHERFORD WRITES CONCERNING “COURAGE” TESTIMONY PERIOD:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Your report on the field service for the new campaign Is very gratifying indeed. The Lord Is putting his blessing on his people now in this country because it appears that the time draws near when the work shall cease and this testimony must be given before the great and final conflict. I am sure that everybody devoted to Him is rejoicing in the Lord In doing this work with the keenest interest. My love to all of like precious faith.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Let's Go!” was I he opening slogan on the &quot;Courage” Testimony Period campaign outline in the December </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> Let’s go where, and for what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After seven million booklets, 60,000 publishers, and at least 10 combinations of 7 for each publisher. How have we done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has received reports from 63 representative companies for the first 15 days of the month of December, and here is what they reveal, by the Lord's grace:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">63 companies 250,164 booklets 5,864 publishers Average—424 each 5,864 company publishers placed 250,164 booklets; an average of 424 booklets per publisher for the first 15 days of the month. This is splendid and beyond our expectations. At this rate we shall have an average of 85 booklets per publisher for the entire month. “Courage” Testimony Period. How is your company doing as compared with this early report?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bethel family have been greatly blessed in this campaign, and averaged 103 booklets per publisher for the first 15 days. Some of the high points in the other sections of sively.’The suggestion is offered that the record “Value of Knowledge” be used in the doorstep setup and played at homes wherever possible. This is an excellent record for the introduction of booklets. The following month the brethren will use the record “Instruction”, which tells the people of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">January should be a splendid month for making back-calls. It is usually cold and people do not get out much, but we can go to their homes for a back-call. Go through your files, and if you have not already called on all of these people with the special offer of 17 booklets on a 25c contribution or all 35 booklets on contribution of 50c, then give these people of good-will the opportunity of obtaining this unusual offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a glorious privilege Jehovah lias given us at this day, of taking the food from the storehouse and distributing it to those in need ! This month of January would be a splendid one for new publishers to begin work, using </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the country are as follows: In Baltimore one unit'averaged 79 booklets per publisher; in Philadelphia, 74; Washington, 714; Chicago, 65; Boston, 604 ; and so on throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now think! If the company publishers are privileged, by the Lord’s grace, to place between 3 million and 4 million booklets during December and the pioneers make their quota of 3 million, and we have 12 additional days during January to carry on this campaign to clean up, during which time the companies will easily place 2 million more and the pioneers another million—where are those 10 million booklets that we had on our shelves at the beginning of the campaign going to be? In the hands of the people, where they belong and where the Lord purposed they should be. Never before was there such a tremendous witness for the Kingdom given in so short a period. Never before was there such a terrific onslaught against the bulwarks of Satan on the earth. Let’s keep on pounding day and night and share in this testimony that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“must be given before the great and final conflict”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>70 Thousand Publishers</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Including More Pioneers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">As indicated by the November </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> during the fiscal year just ended there was an average of 47,762 publishers in the field in the United States, with a peak of publishers of 58,009. Undoubtedly this was one of the most important years in the history of the church, as it saw all the faithful, those of the “little Hock” together with those of the “great multitude”, unitedly marching forward (as locusts) in the face of extreme opposition on the part of the deluded and demonized earthly agents of Satan. Jehovah rewarded His people with further joy in the service and gave them more ■'companions” to assist in carrying forward “His strange work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Trusting the Lord to give tlie increase, we are confidently setting another quota of publishers for this year, seventy thousand publishers. In order to reach this in the United States, it is the privilege of each company to set and diligently strive for a 25-percent increase over its 1940 peak of publishers. Properly caring for the back-call and modelstudy inlerest will be the best means of accomplishing this. Remember the quota of 12 back-calls per month per publisher, 1 model study per publisher, 60 hours per month by ail company publishers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">And, those who have been able to consistently meet and exceed that company publisher goal of hours will have their minds on the “150 hours per month” pioneer service I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“COURAGE” TESTIMONY FLASHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CALIFORNIA. “ •Courage’ Testimony Period started with unprecedented impetus. We anticipate many last-minute needs for booklets on the part of companies that figured only on their quota of ten sets per publisher. Already some companies find they have placed about half their quota of booklets. Dec. 5.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Nine of us placed 103 sets of 7 in 4 days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Six publishers placed 43 sets in three days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">OHIO. “I have been able, by the Lord’s grace, to place 34 sets of 17 and 18 sets of 7 booklets, mostly on back-calls, by December 6.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">VIRGINIA. “Sr.----and I placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">789 in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> first 4 days of the campaign.” (Pioneer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">December 14 a pioneer writes: “Sister and I have placed 2,000 booklets in the first eleven days, and have 1,200 left. At the same rate these will be gone in seven more days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">NEW YORK. “My territory is 90-percent Jewish. During the first 15 days of ‘Courage’ ’Testimony Period I put in 45 hours and placed 635 booklets, including 71 sets of 7. This was accomplished in week-end and evening work. One evening, 2i hours, placed 9 sets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Preparing himself for war Ehud made a two - edged sword. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> shows that the two-edged sword (the message of The Theocracy) ‘is an instrument of warfare that punctures and cuts in all directions’. Ehud’s sword pictures the work now being accomplished by the spreading of the Kingdom message throughout the earth, in which the faithful have a part. Ehud girded his sword, which meant preparation and to be fully equipped, and thus he went forward, trusting in Jehovah; and this pictures the Lord’s people today in action!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> prepares the territory for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watehtorcer</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, which starts on February 1 and which will last for three months. This will be a world-wide campaign, which will come to a climax in the month of April, during which month the lord’s people, the remnant and the other sheep, will assemble to celebrate the Memorial. A peak of 70,000 publishers in the field by April is the goal aimed at. Everyone who loves the Lord, and has covenanted to do His will, will take part regularly in this campaign. Regional servants, zone servants, companies and pioneers should prepare to make this the greatest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign that we have ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The special offer will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of $1.00. We should diligently strive to place this offer with every person of good-will on our back-call files and those we meet in the door-to-door work. Persons who are unable to obtain this special offer should be offered the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> booklet on a contribution of 25c. If they cannot afford either of these, the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font3"> should be left on any contribution they can make, or free if they cannot contribute but promise to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The quota is 100,000 subscriptions, 1,000,000 bound books, and 12,000,000 booklets, in three months. With a new peak of publishers in prospect, back-calls ready for the campaign, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and each publisher doing his part, </span><span class="font3">this quota can easily be reached. The quota for each publisher will be 1 subscription, 7 bound books and 80 booklets each month. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">repeatedly stresses the importance of each publisher’s arranging a regular schedule for each week’s Kingdom service. Those publishers doing this are proving more efficient in attaining the quota of hours and back-calls per month, and also making their quota in campaigns. They have real joy and courage in this time of peril, keeping in mind only The Theocracy and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Weekly Check</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A weekly check should be kept by each company during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign; in fact, it is well to do this at all times. The advantage and importance of this is being proved by the progress and results of the booklet campaign, and companies should by now be well acquainted on how to keep this weekly check. Company publishers should</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">co-operate by turning in report slips promptly, so that at each service meeting an accurate report can be given, a check made on the progress of the company, and suggestions made as to how to maintain and exceed the quotas. Some companies may wish to make a “thermometer” in connection with this, and the December 1938 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> can be referred to, which gives the chart and outline to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies and pioneers should see that they have the following equipment ready for this campaign: Stock of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, </span><span class="font3">which should be checked by company servant and stockkeeper to ascertain how many are needed for this campaign, and an order made out and sent immediately; a good supply of Subscription Record Sheets and Subscription Blanks on hand (and, if necessary, include them in your next order. It is very important and necessary that, in addition to sending in the subscription slips for new and renewed subscriptions, companies and pioneers should fill out the Subscription Record Sheet to accompany these) ; “Instruction” record (l'-154), which will again be used to introduce this special offer of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription, with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span><span class="font3"> Companies should have a sufficient supply of this record on hand for their needs when the campaign begins. More should be ordered immediately, if needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Distributors’ Copies of “The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies and pioneers should anticipate their needs NOW and have sufficient copies of each issue for each publisher during this campaign. And always allow enough time for the change in number of magazines to reach this office two weeks before the date of issue of the magazine. For example, the change in number for the February 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">should reach the Brooklyn office not later than January 15. as it takes about two weeks to correct, run and mail the list before the date of issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Subscription Blanks (which have the form number L-l) have instructions on the back. Only these new subscription blanks should be used, and a new supply should be ordered, if necessary. Each publisher should be thoroughly familiar with these instructions before taking a subscription. It is suggested that the companies have these instructions read at a service meeting and every point emphasized. In addition to the publisher’s signature, the name of the company should appear at the bottom of each subscription blank sent In.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ehud’s sword and the pile of stones in the river Jordan “picture the message that is delivered against the fat, selfish, religio-political, commercial organization. The message concerning God’s kingdom, which has been piled'up during the past twenty years, is so vast that the religious systems and allies aforementioned cannot get rid of the same. The Theocratic message, which the Lord has put out on the earth and pushed clear into ‘Christendom’s’ vitals, is there to stay, foretelling the violent destruction of ‘Christendom’ at Armageddon.” Every publisher of The Theocracy will with eagerness do his part in this coining </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">campaign, having in mind the name Ehud, which means unity in action and a real job to be done thoroughly.</span></p>

This system is partially in effect in mailing this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> and will be in complete operation for the February </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> It will affect only those pioneers who are in families or are permanent partners or groups who have the same address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the cases where there are two or more in one family or two or more partners working together, the Society will send the required number of copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> for the entire group in one envelope instead of in two or more separate envelopes. So that pioneers will not be missing their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> or other information, it will be necessary that pioneers be more careful and accurate in sending in changes of address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will aid the office if permanent pioneer partners Or groups will notify the Society </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font2"> in cases where their copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> can be sent together. In all cases where the family names and the addresses are identical the Society will group the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informants </span><span class="font2">without notice; but when such is not the case and a saving may be made, we shall appreciate your notifying us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many times the wife pioneering with her husband sends in n change of address for herself with her given name, but no notice changing her husband’s address ; thus the office docs not know whether it was negligence on their part in not sending in two address slips or whether one is staying to finish the territory. In this connection it would help the office if the wife would always use her husband's name or initials and not her given name, and always indicate whether one or both addresses are to be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In cases where the pioneer is also a company servant two address slips should be mailed and one be marked ‘‘company servant” together with the name of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much time is lost in trying to get the correct address on company and pioneer orders when correct addresses are not given. When a pioneer or company order is mailed to us and the address does not correspond with the address on our records, we are at loss to know which address is the proper one. When literature is ordered sent lo the company servant and the address on the order blank does not correspond to our records, we do not change the company servant’s mailing address, unless a separate notice of change is sent. The Society is doing everything possible to get your orders to you at the right address and on time, but when there are repeated inconsistencies in addresses it cannot be expected that you -will get your orders and mail. Pioneers and, particularly, company servants will do well to check the address on the envelope in which this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">is received, and if such address is not correct, notify the Society immediately.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Credit to Companies for Colored Booklets</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In order to make no mistakes in crediting the company accounts for colored-cover booklets placed with the publishers during the special seven-booklet campaign, the following is here set out as outlined on the back of the special order blank:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stockkeeper will keep an accurate record of all the colored-cover booklets placed with the publishers at a penny each from the stockroom. At the end of the month he will report to the company servant (who makes out the report card) the number of colored-cover booklets placed with the company publishers at one cent each, and the company servant will request credit for these on the report card sent in to the Society at the end of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This company report card should be signed by both the company servant and the stockkeeper, so that the Society is assured that this matter has been carefully checked by both individuals. In small companies that do not have a stockkeeper the signing-by the company servant will be sufficient. If the company delivers or ships to pioneers or other companies any self-covered or coloredcover booklets on an order received from the Society, the Society will send a credit memo crediting the company at the regular company rate for the literature thus supplied. The company will not ask for any credit on their report for these booklets. Request credit only on colored - cover booklets placed with </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY PUBLISHERS FOB THE DECEMBER CAMPAIGN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the booklet campaign lias been extended to include the first 12 days of January, companies will note on their January report to the Society the number of colored-cover bookiefs placed with company publishers at one cent each during the first 12 days of January, so that proper credit can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the remainder of this campaign any company that has an excessive supply of booklets which the company cannot dispose of by January 12 can arrange to transfer them to any near-by pioneer or company, likewise any company needing literature may draw on the stock of any near-by company having a surplus, making out the usual Transfer of Stock form, without first getting the Society’s approval.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Organization Instructions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">There has been prepared (and this will be sent to each regional, zone and company servant, as well as each pioneer) a sheet entitled “Amendments to Organization Instructions”, which amendments go into effect January 1, 1941. Therein are some corrections and additions applying to various servants in the organization. On receipt of this sheet, each one should bring his copy of “Organization Instructions (as amended)” up to date by pasting the amended paragraphs in their propel* places or striking out the amended portions of the original form and attaching the new form thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much company servant should likewise bring these amended instructions to the attention of the company and furnish each servant affected (including study conductors) a complete copy of the portion of the “Organization Instructions” as they now stand affecting that servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Organization Instructions” should be carefully studied from time to time and complied with. It would be well for the zone servant also to go over these instructions with the companies, and particularly with the servants, to see that they are understood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Campaign Extended One Month </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4-Month Campaign, Ending with May, Should Show Results</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Go over Your Quota on Books, Booklets and Subscriptions 11</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">There Is no doubt that the Lord is directing His organization in the earth. Manifestly the extension of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign to include the month of May is a merciful provision of the Lord to permit us to make up our quota for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. The quota set for February, March and April was 100,000 new subscriptions, 1.000,000 bound books, and 6,750.000 booklets. This was a reasonable quota for the more than 50,000 company publishers and pioneers now reporting regularly in the United States. However, according to the rate at which new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions are being received at Brooklyn now, by the end of April we shall have obtained just a little better than 50,000, which is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">only half</span><span class="font1"> the quota for the threemonth campaign. Up to March 31 there were 37,521 new subscriptions sent in to the Brooklyn office. It appears, too, that we shall not attain the quota of books and booklets. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">50,000 Subscriptions to Go!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">February, March and April have slipped by and the quota is only half made. This means there is much work to be done during May. There are 50.000 publishers regularly reporting in the United States. If each publisher sees to it that he obtains at least one subscription during May (regardless of how many he has previously obtained), we shall gain our objective, 100,000 new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions for the campaign. The very fact that the Lord has arranged through Uis organization for the extension of the campaign indicates that it is His will that the quota be made. Therefore let each publisher of The Theocracy soberly determine to make it his business to get at least one subscription before May 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Books and booklets also are low, but these will show a corresponding increase with the subscriptions. If the new subscription quota is reached, undoubtedly the rest of the quota will be reached. Each company publisher, therefore, should put forth every effort during May to place five bound books and at least thirty booklets, in addition to getting subscriptions ; pioneers, 40 books and 250 booklets. Elsewhere in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> suggestion is made as to how to increase the booklet placements. and other features of the work. More time in the field is required. If each individual assumes his responsibility and takes care of his share of the quota we shall more than make the quota. Wherever you go, always be prepared to take a subscription. By the Lord's grace we shall go over the top on everything, books, booklets and subscriptions if we do our part, namely, be a publisher and put in time in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is every reason why the quota can be reached in May. Weather conditions no longer hinder anyone in any part of the country. Rural territory can easily be covered, usually yielding much fruit. With favorable weather the doorstep setups using the “Instruction” record will be unanimously pressed into service. Evening witnessing will be carried on all over the country. We shall have a new peak of publishers. With the willing publishers of The Theocracy moving forward unitedly, each having in mind his share in the quota, we shall reach our goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the Lord's grace each company wilt go over the top in all three features of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">April 1, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">To the Magazine Publishers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The witnesses for Jehovah are the representatives of the Most High and should deport themselves accordingly with dignity and gentility whether on the street or elsewhere. In the magazine street work avoid anything that has the appearance of rudeness. It is reported that some call out: “Vitamins for the mind. Read The WATCHTOWER.&quot; That is hardly proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The exhibiting of signs during this magazine service seems to have performed its work. Henceforth no more signs will be used. Calling attention in a dignified way to the headings of the articles in the magazine will be more effective, no doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the people observe from your words and conduct that you desire to help and comfort them in these days of great stress.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be fearless of man and trust entirely in Jehovah and his King; therefore be very courageous. Jehovah and the Lord Jesus guide and bless you.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Proper Expressions for Street Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The brethren, in offering the magazines on street corners, should use expressions that will not cause provocation. The expression “Religion is a racket&quot; lias been used extensively in the past, and from now on should be discontinued, and constructive statements be used. The publisher can express to the passerby, “Remedy for would distress. Read The Watchtower, 5c.’’ This should not be shouted in one’s ear or be heard across the street, but should be spoken in a moderate tone of voice. Publishers may call out the titles of the articles in the magazines ; or, set out below are some expressions that Brother Rutherford has approved in connection with “Read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> 5c”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Remedy for world distress The Theocracy, the hope of mankind Escape from death at Armageddon Bible removes fear of death</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Prophecy shows deliverance near Truth brings light, peace, Joy World peace by God's Kingdom Comfort for ‘men of good-will’ </span><span class="font1">quota. In addition, make a separate quota for the month of May, reckoned at one subscription, five books and thirty booklets per publisher, and then permit nothing to prevent your company from making it. Keep a weekly check on your progress; and if you begin to lag behind, put forth additional effort. Let the servants take the lead. Undoubtedly May will witness the greatest effort put forth by Jehovah’s people during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are serious days. Throughout the earth freedom of action is rapidly being taken from Jehovah’s people. This may be the last </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. Do not neglect your privileges. Do your part. With full confidence in Jehovah join in the victory song I Lay aside your “weights” I Remember your individual quotas! One subscription, five books, thirty booklets, during May! Jehovah’s will shall be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Seek righteousness and meekness Theocracy means totalitarians’ end Understand God’s present purpose Kingdom benefits for humankind</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Bible questions answered Teach children the truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> magazine has printed on it (in large type, displaying the contents of the magazine) expressions that you may use when on the street corners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the publishers of the Kingdom should be diligent in having a part in the magazine work. It is hoped that in this manner, throughout the United States, more than one million magazines (of both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation')</span><span class="font1"> will be distributed each month. We feel sure that everyone of the magazine publishers will give special heed to Brother Rutherford’s letter printed above and follow the organization instructions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Many individuals are arranging their affairs so that they can enter the pioneer service. A letter in March and another in April have been sent companies, which should have been studied carefully at service meetings. Company servants should encourage all publishers of the Kingdom to enter this field of the service if they possibly can, either in isolated territory or with the company. Individuals desiring further information should be told to write the Society.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font1">In the legislatures of New York, Connecticut, and other states, lawmakers are now submitting bills, all very alike in form, seemingly for the innocent purpose of controlling ■ the dissemination of propaganda”.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 8 exposes the source of these bills, the Catholic-Fascist politicians, and shows the use to which they will be put to prevent the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Use “Enemies” Record</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">During the month of June all publishers will use the doorstep setup with the phonograph to introduce the 3-bouk combination.

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Know What’s in It</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Each publisher of the Kingdom should be fully acquainted with what is contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font1"> Company servants should carefully check with each company publisher to see if he has received his copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font1"> If he has not, he should order a copy for the publisher. They are 5c a copy. Five or ten minutes of each service meeting should be devoted to the study of this booklet, each week a different </span><span class="font2">part.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">June, Bound-Book Month </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>The Greatest Yet! Be Supplied!!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Concerning the activity of the ambassadors of The Theocratic Government a recent issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Walch-toirer</span><span class="font1"> states, &quot;Now the people of God, having been favored by the light of the Mighty One, Christ Jesus, shining upon them, joyfully arise and shine forth the message of the Kingdom. Have you arisen, and is the light shining upon you, and are you using that light to the glory of The Theocracy?” All who now take an active part, striving diligently to make the quota which the Lord outlines through his organization, are doing this very thing; and this results in the Lord’s approval and rich blessings upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With a new peak in publishers imminent and everyone on the job doing his part, we should by far exceed our previous record month for bound books, January, 1940, when 552,178 bound books were placed. In that month 40,278 publishers reported, whereas around 70,000 or more are expected by the month of June; for which reason many more bound books should be placed than in any other campaign. Additionally, we have the experience from the previous bound-book campaign ; so we should be better prepared for this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The special offer will include any bound books from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God </span><span class="font1">to and including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font1"> Three of these bound books will he offered on a conti ibution of 35e. Also combinations </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> 6 on contribution of 70c, 9 on .81.05 contribution, and 12 on contribution of .$1.-10, can be placed. In the foreign languages all bound books except the latest one can be offered, at three on contribution of 40e. During June a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">special effort . </span><span class="font1">should be made to place foreign books. All companies should be prepared and equipped with a sufficient number of books that each publisher can he supplied with at least three combinations of three different books in the English language, making nine books per publisher, and as many different foreign books as are available and can be used in your territory. Companies and pioneers should check their stock to see that they have their supplies on hand in readiness. Jehovah's people have taken the offensive* in this warfare and there is no slacking down from one campaign to another. We light shoulder to shoulder, laying down a constant barrage of truth against demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies with Unbalanced Stock</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If your company is not equipped with a sufficient supply of all bound books needed and you know of a near-by company that has an over-supply of the books you need, then get in touch with them and, if possible, make an even exchange of stock without using a Transfer of Stock blank. If an even exchange cannot be arranged, then use the regular Transfer of Stock blank. This blank should be properly tilled out and signed by both companies and sent promptly to the Brooklyn office. In this the zone servants should assist the companies at every visit and check carefully over their stock, arranging proper adjustments of literature and using the Transfer of Stock blank in accordance with Instructions when necessary. If there is no company near by from whom ।</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">you can obtain the needed amount of stock, then send in an order immediately for what you will need, liemember that last year many com-panies were out of stock long before the month was over. Pioneers also may exchange stock and arrange transfers when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In ordering literature companies and pioneers may order any literature they desire, hut some of our stock will run out. Therefore we will substitute other literature, unless you tell us not to do so. The books </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liyht</span><span class="font1"> 1 and 2 and I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">indication</span><span class="font1"> 1, 2 and 3 should always be placed in sets. If you are short of any one of these books to complete your sets, order what you need to balance, them. In various depots throughout the country we have an overstock on certain literature, and would appreciate your ordering this in preference to other publications. On the West Coast, at the Seattle depot we have a good supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font1"> Other books can be had, but we do not have large quantities there. Extra stock at other places is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At Los Angeles; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches, Jehovah, Pi eparation. Preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At St. Louis: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches, Preparation, Prophecy, Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At Brooklyn: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies. Riches, Jehovah, Preparation, Preservation, Prophecy, Government, Creation.</span><span class="font1"> We have the largest stock on the books mentioned, but from Brooklyn we can supply others if requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers should work their individual territories during this campaign, and also study groups should cover their territory regularly with this special offer, using the doorstep setup. Those who have magazine routes established should show the people on their routes this special bound-book offer, using the advertisement in the magazine to help them place combinations. Place sets with your friends, neighbors and relatives. All good-will names in your back-call iiles should he given an opportunity to receive a set. and the back-call servant should see that this is pushed. With every person with whom a set is placed, arrange to call back and thus encourage them to also read their books. Last year, according to instructions, the catalog was used to good advantage, and this has aided in placements. Be sure to have a good supply of bookmarks also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company servants should see that all foreign sections are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">thorouyhly </span><span class="font1">covered. This work can be done by all publishers using the testimony booklet. Wherever possible the foreign-speaking brethren should devote all their time to work amongst the foreigners in their company territory. There is too much foreign literature in storage. Order your supply of foreign hooks for the June work, and then let’s get these into the hands of the people, where they will do some good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Credit to Companies for Combinations Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A rebate of 25c will be given to each company for each set of three bound books placed. This should be reported properly on the June report card sent to the Society by the company, by showing on the bottom of the report card the number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sets of three hooks</span><span class="font1"> placed. The company will be given credit on their account for the number of sets placed. In no</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">other way will this be done. Be sure that your report card is made out properly, so as to avoid unnecessary work or errors. Pioneers will not be given a credit, as they already receive the literature at a very low rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Individual publishers will get their rebate from the stockkeeper or treasurer by showing on their daily report slips the number of sets placed of three bound books. These report slips should be turned in to the stockkeeper or treasurer, who will give the proper rebate to the publisher. The treasurer will keep an accurate record of the rebates given the publishers, and this should correspond with the company total at the end of the month. Either the stockkeeper or the treasurer should initial these slips in order to show that a rebate was given, and then turn them over to the secretary, who will keep them on file as long after the end of the month as they feel is necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">70,000 Publishers Our Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great central theme of the Victory Song now opened up in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> to thrill the Lord’s people is—the willing volunteers: those 19,000 who joyfully joined Barak and Deborah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Boiled down to the Kingdom terminology of our day this means those who joyfully offer themselves to the Lord through his organization for any service the Lord requires done at the present time. The fact that the I.ord made Deborah to say, &quot;My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people,” indicates that it is only those who do this that can be pleasing to the Lord and his organization. There is not one word of commendation for the other approximately three million nine hundred and ninety thousand. Only those who wholeheartedly engage in the Lord's service can have the Lord’s approval and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are associated with the various company organizations well over 79,0(10 different individuals who have participated in the field service to some degree at least. As Jonadab’s heart was with Jehu, so must the heart of the approved ones in our day he with the antilypieal Deborah. There is no other way of obtaining deliverance and life. Each one of these seventy thousand and more brethren should be actively engaged in the field service, and this should give us a peak of at least 70,000 publishers during May. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■,</span></p>

The weather during the month of May is, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">:i rule, ideal for the</span><span class="font1"> witness work; it is neither too cold nor too hot, but splendid to work in city or country. Daylight saving is in effect throughout the country, permitting many to engage in the sen ice during the evening. Evening service should be utilized to the very limit this summer. We have a very important message that must be delivered to the people in a short time.

<p><span class="font1">Take the name and address of those obtaining this combination. The following week arrangements can be made for back-call follow-up work on these people. Present the regular </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Match to irer</span><span class="font1"> combination with the recorded message at that time, and follow it through with each name to a regular back-call and model study if possible. This arrangement will afford a splendid opportunity for those who are timid and have not engaged in the service to any great extent in the past to get started in the witness work and also to get started in making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The groups that cover the territory with the booklets can make the back-calls; or other back-call groups may be arranged while the initial group goes through each week and places booklet combinations, turning the names over to the back-call group, who will follow up the next week. Much will depend upon the available brethren in arranging for this work. Try to get everyone engaged in it, particularly the people of good-will and newlj’ interested who are associating with the company.</span></p>

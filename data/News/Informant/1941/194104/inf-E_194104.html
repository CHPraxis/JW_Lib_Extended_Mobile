<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>How Are Your Company and Individual Quotas?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Sign” Testimony Period is the name that is used to designate the activity of the Theocratic publishers during the month of April, 1941. What does “The Sign” mean to us? We know that to the enemy it will be an indication of false security. They think that everything is all right with them because they have accomplished certain things in opposition to the kingdom of the Lord God; but what does “The Sign” mean to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures clearly indicate it will mark a time when the servants of the Most High God must render an account of their stewardship to Jehovah. The prophet Ezekiel says, in this respect, that before the six men with the slaughter weapons went into action the man with the writer’s inkhorn had to render a report. “I have done as thou hast commanded me.” Jesus says “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”. The prophet Isaiah has this testimony: “Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered. Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.” These and many other scriptures clearly depict the responsibility resting upon the servants of the Most High now. They are to push the battle to the gate with greater vigor as this momentous event draws near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The instrument the Lord has assigned to us for “The Sion” Testimony Period is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> and the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of one dollar. This combination is to be introduced with the phonograph and the “Instruction” record. If we are unable to use the phonograph or do not have one, of course, we are to use the testimony card provided. These are the particular instruments for this campaign. This is to be the primary offer and the way it is to be presented. We have no more right to change this arrangement than Jael, Ehud or David had to reject the instruments provided by the Lord and use instruments of their own choosing. It is very important that each and every feature of the Lord’s work now be carried on according to organization instructions. If some feature of the work does not come up to expectations and we have not been obeying organization instructions, then we must accept the responsibility for the failure of accomplishment of that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up until February 28 we have less than 12,000 subscriptions. Our original quota for that month was more than 33,000. In other words, we are about two-thirds behind our quota, and we are inclined to believe that much of this is due to the fact that not all the publishers use with enthusiasm and faithfully the Instruments that the Lord provides and in the way that He directs. Each and every one should give this matter very careful consideration. Now it has pleased the Lord to extend this campaign for another month. Let us one and all check up on our activity and see if we can increase our effectiveness in utilizing these provisions that the Lord has arranged for this campaign and in that way increase the number of subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The newspapers of the country have had their special witness by mail. The Protestant clergy, school boards and politicians have received their warning by having the message served upon them by the local publishers. If this is not complete, steps should be taken to see that it is completed as soon as possible.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Watchtower ’ Campaign Extended to Include May</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>All Quotas Should Be Reached by Then</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign seems to be moving along better than it did last year; and it should, with more publishers in the field, therefore more hours devoted to the work. If every Kingdom publisher would obtain just one </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription a month we would reach 150,000 for three months ; but reports show that many of the brethren up to this time do not even have their first subscription. Are you trying to obtain subscriptions? Have you talked to your neighbors and your best friends? Have you made back-calls? Are you putting in more hours door-to-door? Those publishers who already have their one a month will, by the Lord's grace, try to obtain four by the end of May. Each company publisher should have a keen interest in the “thermometer” which shows the progress of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign week by week. Let’s make this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign the greatest ever, and remember, with four months to work, our quota should be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A total of 11,416 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower and Consolation, </span><span class="font3">including new foreign-language subscriptions, have been received at the Brooklyn office. More should be obtained if we expect to reach our quota of 100,000. For February, then, we should have made 25 percent of our quota ; whereas the above figures show that we made 12 percent, or about half of our quota. With the campaign extended to the end of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time has now come when the very Important message contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font3"> booklets is to go to the people in general. If the complete combination, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription, bound book and two booklets, cannot be placed with the people, then the bound book and two booklets should be offered on a contribution of 25c. If you are not successful in placing that, then leave the three booklets on a contribution of ten cents. The importance of leaving the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State </span><span class="font3">in every home possible cannot be overstated. Those who have read these booklets realize the importance of the message they contain and the great privilege and responsibility resting upon all the Lord’s people to see that they are properly made accessible to each and every one. Try to at least leave the booklet combination in each home. However, if they cannot take the three booklets, leave either </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of five cents, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font3"> on any contribution they are able to offer, or free where the Interest and circumstances justify it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">month of May, giving us more time (in which more favorable weather Is to be expected), and everyone doing his part, we should come much closer to and even exceed 25,000 new subscriptions per month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Special Letter on Pioneer Service</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A special letter to all Theocratic publishers regarding the importance of pioneer activity, which field has reached a new peak of 3,877 fulltime workers, is being mailed out to all pioneers, removed pioneers, companies, zone servants and regional servants. This letter should receive the prompt and serious consideration of each and every one. In all companies it should be read at the first service meeting following its receipt. It should be read again at the conclusion of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study following this service meeting above mentioned, and at the second service meeting after it has been received fifteen minutes should be set aside for a general discussion of the letter and its contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Company servants, zone servants and regional servants should personally aid all individuals who are interested in having a part in the pioneer service and should help them to see their privilege in that respect, particularly those who are attaining the 60-hour quota or close to it. If you are contemplating pioneer service, write the Society for more Information and a questionnaire.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Memorial Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Each company should prepare for and conduct the Memorial service this year as outlined in the notice in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society desires an accurate report of the attendance. Care should be taken that no duplicate reports are submitted. Each company is to show, at the bottom of their report card for the month of April, the total Memorial attendance, and the total partaking of the emblems. These totals should Include everyone in attendance regardless of whether associated with the local company organization or not. Companies that go to some other company for the Memorial service should mark their April report card “Attended Memorial service with ... ”, giving the name of the company, but do not show any figures. Pioneers who are associated with companies will, of course, be included in the company’s report and they are not to make a separate Memorial report. Where pioneers partake of the Memorial separate from company organizations, one of such group should send in the report of the total attendance on his or her report card. They are to report pioneers and any other good-will interest who may be assembled with them. Isolated pioneers who partake of the emblems by themselves will report such on their report card.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Old-Style Phonographs Out of Stock</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society does not have any phonographs in stock at the present time, either the old or the new model; so please do not place orders. The new-model phonograph is coming along very well, but because of the emergency measures in the United States it has been very difficult to get certain parts. However, it is hoped that within the next month or two a very definite announcement can be made on the new-model phonograph.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>New Peak in Publishers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">April should see a new peak in publishers, a peak both for companies and for pioneers. Our alltime peak to date was in June, 1940, when we had 58,009 workers in the field. April this year should bring this total up to 60,000 at least. The following reasons are advanced as to why April should be the banner month to date: During April this year we celebrate Memorial, which brings home to each and every one the true relationship that should exist between the Lord’s people and their Head and King. This should impel everyone, anointed and Jbna-dabs, to more earnest effort to have some part in the Kingdom service. During the month of April we are privileged to carry to the people the new and vitally Important message contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> booklet, which clearly and forcibly puts before each one Jehovah’s Theocratic</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The offer for the “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period, in June, is announced now so that the pioneers and companies can, if necessary, obtain a supply of literature well in advance.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Model Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>You Can Do It!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Once again Brother Rutherford has called our attention to our responsibilities with regard to the back-call work. The portion of his letter of January 8, 1941, on “Back-Calls” should be considered at your service meeting. There is now no feature of the Kingdom service more important than the back-call work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In January 1940 the matter of increased back-call activity was brought forcefully to the fore. Brother Rutherford pointed out that “back-calls are one of the best means of informing those who are somewhat interested of their privileges and the necessity of service” and showed that twelve back-calls a month is a reasonable quota. This had a stimulating effect upon the work, and the report for January 1940 showed a marked increase, the publishers averaging 3.7 back-calls for the month, which was the peak for the fiscal year 1940. October, 1940, the first month of the present fiscal year, saw a new peak reached of 4.6 back-calls per company publisher; however, by January 1941 the publishers averaged only 3.3 back-calls each, a drop of 1.3 below the peak and a decrease of .4 from January 1940. The pioneers have never surpassed their peak of 26.9 back-calls attained ’way back in November 1939, averaging only 22.1 in January 1941. This would seem to indicate that the brethren are not giving the proper attention to the back-call feature of the Kingdom interests. It may be that some of the newer publishers have not been properly instructed in the carrying on of this work. Perhaps some have thought themselves incapable or too inexperienced. What requisites are necessary? Who is qualified to make back-calls and conduct model studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone Qualified</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If some special training were necessary, if only a few were qualified to make back-calls, there might be an excuse for a decline in the average number of back-calls. This, however, is not the case. Everyone who engages in the regular door-to-door witnessing and who keenly appreciates the Kingdom and his position as a servant of The Theocracy In a covenant to unselfishly obey Jehovah’s will is qualified to carry on the back-call work. Publishers of the companies and study groups can set aside an evening each week for back-call work; show the new ones how to proceed in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although conditions at each prospective back-call may differ somewhat, the proper procedure on the initial call is quite simple. The publisher should take with him his phonograph and records (arranging including the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> may be included in the special conbination. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> will be offered on a contribution of 25c each, as usual, and are the only two books not included in the special offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All foreign-language bound books, with the exception of the most recent publication in each language, can be Included in the offer of three, on a contribution of 40c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The more recent inventories that the Society has of the stock on hand to borrow these If he does not have his own) and endeavor to play one or more records. His equipment should include sample copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> books and booklets of the current offer, a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklet, a Bible, and bookmarks or folders with the address of the local company headquarters. After playing the phonograph he should talk the literature, pointing out the necessity of Bible instruction, and show the person upon whom the call is made the very interesting arrangement of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklet. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Model Study</span><span class="font3"> No. 3 contains an explanation of the proper procedure in the conduct of a model study.) At this back-call an effort should be made to arrange another back-call at which time a model study can be started; for, as with back-calls, any publisher can conduct a model study. The reports show, however, that a very small percentage of the publishers are now engaging in conducting model studies. Hence this branch of the work has not properly advanced. Those publishers who have recognized its Importance and energetically pushed the model-study work have been richly blessed. Do not become easily discouraged if your first attempt is not successful, but press on with the firm conviction that this is the work Jehovah would have done at this time and He will bless your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You publishers now active in the back-call and mo del-study work should encourage and assist new publishers who have never participated in this work by inviting them to accompany you when you make some back-calls or conduct your model study, with the end in view of stimulating their back-call activity. You may have more back-calls and model studies than you can properly care for, and in such case it may be convenient to turn some of these over to the new publisher who accompanies you. After two or three weeks attending the model study, ask the new publisher to conduct it, which will be good experience for him, and probably he can continue thereafter and you can start another model study elsewhere at the same time of day. In other words, every effort should now be made to be an efficient publisher yourself and to aid in increasing the back-call activity amongst the new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Through on New Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mere receiving of a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> twice a month is not sufficient. It requires more than that for the people of good-will to gain knowledge and understanding and an appreciation of the vital necessity of Kingdom service. In with the companies show that there are scattered throughout the country approximately 400,000 copies of books from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> inclusive. All of these, we feel sure, can be distributed during the month of June. Get your supply now of at least 9 books for each regular publisher, and look for the details of the campaign in your next </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> Companies will be charged on invoices as usual, and credits granted as on the previous campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">many cases people subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> because they think it is helping along the good work, which belief eases their conscience, but do not appreciate the all-important fact that they need the information contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which when properly studied and acted upon will result in their salvation and without which they will suffer destruction. Therefore the obligation is laid upon the Lord’s witnesses to aid the new subscribers to realize the Importance of this publication and the message it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Back-calls should be made regularly upon the new subscribers, playing the various lecture series, and then develop model studies, using the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklets provided by the Society. Every new subscriber is a good prospect for a model study. Be sure to take advantage of this and get model studies going in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the fact that many new subscribers do not appreciate the need of thoroughly studying each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as it is received, it would be well for each publisher to make it a point at the close of every call upon the new subscribers, whether a regular back-call or a model study, to mention </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> This should be done in a casual manner. Probably the most effective would be to point out some statements made in the latest issue which were of special interest to you. A few sentences might be read from the current issue and point out that this is the same as they are now receiving regularly. In other words, be well acquainted with the subject matter in the latest issue received and bring some outstanding part to their attention, thus arousing their interest and encouraging them to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> This practice of being thoroughly familiar with the contents of the latest issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer </span><span class="font3">and stressing certain points will also be beneficial In your regular witnessing and back-calls made on those who are not subscribers. In this manner </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will be kept prominently before the minds of the people, with great profit to them and oneself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In ills letter of January 8. 1941, Brother Rutherford also stressed the importance of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. Publishers should always stand ready to take people of good-will to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. At each back-call and model study a hearty invitation should be extended to these new ones to accompany you and attend the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study of the local company regularly. Help the “other sheep” in your territory to learn the way to life. Take them with you to the study, that they may get the full benefit of being </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Efficiency</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each publisher holding an individual territory assignment should have a personal back-call file. These slips should be retained in the territory envelope and kept up-to-date by recording each call made, literature placed, records played, etc. Every individual territory requires 12 back-calls a month and one model study a week. Are you making this quota? Is your territory being given the proper attention?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to keeping your personal back-call file in order, a Back-Call Follow-Up Report should be turned In at your local company headquarters for each back-call made and each time you conduct a model study. Other forms should also be employed, and it would be well to discuss in the service meeting the proper use and filling out of these various forms, for the mutual benefit of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Increased activity is the order of the day. The back-call and modelstudy work should now be stressed as never before. Company servants should take the lead. Each publisher should look after his individual quota. The time is short. People of goodwill must learn of The Theocracy, the place of safety. Therefore let us continually keep in mind the admonition by Brother Rutherford, “The responsibility is laid upon the witnesses of the great THEOCRAT to see that the people have opportunity to receive such knowledge. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Do your part.&quot;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Information for Company Servants, Sound Servants, and Pioneers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Please note the following when ordering any parts for phonographs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First give the number of your phonograph; second, give complete name of the part desired. If you are not sure of the name of the part wanted, then give a detailed description or a rough drawing showing where the part goes. When ordering carrying handles, state whether they are fastened to your phonograph by a lengthwise or a crosswise clip. Please state whether the winding cranks are of the slotted type or threaded type. Make distinction between crank clips and crank supports. When ordering any kind of spring give a definite description, such as governor spring, winding shaft retaining spring, or mainspring for motor. Please do not take it for granted that we know what parts have been broken or write stating “Send a spring for my phonograph.” Be specific. This will eliminate mistakes in shipping parts to you, which in some cases had to be returned and other parts sent because of not being clear. In ordering any parts, literature, or supplies, do not use symbols, but write out plainly what you require.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Brother Rutherford’s Letter</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Everyone Has Started by Now</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> containing Brother Rutherford's letter and detailed instructions for carrying on the advanced Kingdom activity has undoubtedly been received by all the brethren with great joy and studied carefully, with the result—enthusiastic participation in this new campaign. From everywhere joyful expressions of gratitude to the Lord for this new arrangement are coining to the olliee. The brethren realized that there was a great need for some provision to care for the good-will interest in towns and cities outside of those cities now having company organizations, as well as concerted effort in company territory. Through this new setup the Lord has opened up the way to care for these people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is very clear what is to be done, how it is going to be done, who is responsible for doing it. and also the minute care the Lord has taken in properly instructing and equipping us to carry on this work. For the past three years He has provided detailed Organization Instructions for our guidance. He 1ms provided regional and zone servants to instruct us, so that, by now, all companies have had ample opportunity to be in full harmonious action and able to carry on without the aid of regional or zone servants. If we are not in that condition now it must be because of negligence; the Lord has taken care of His portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The time has come. Brother Rutherford’s letter further says, when “everyone should be able to assume and carry out his or her responsible duty without aid from any human creature”. That means that we have no excuse left for refraining from carrying out our part of the Kingdom work now assigned to us by the Lord. Each company, each servant and each publisher must bear his own burden. The company can no longer run to the zone servant or to the Society ami say, “We cannot bear our burdens; send ns one or two pioneers. We are too busily engaged in secular employment to care for all the Kingdom interests.” From now on they will be required to tell this to the Lord. He is the one who assigns the burden, or Kingdom responsibilities, and no human organization of creatures has any authority to take them away. Neither can the publishers any longer say to the back-call or territory servant or other servants in the company, “I cannot bear my burden. I am unable to work this territory or make these back-calls.” They too will have to tell this to the Lord ; it is their burden placed upon them by the Lord, and the Lord through His organization says they should be able to bear their own burdens now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are confident, however, that none of the brethren will desire to shirk their responsibility in this respect, but that each one will accept his or her part joyfully and work</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Great Multitude” Testimony Period </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Children” Featured During December</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Everyone Participates!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Climaxing another glorious year of service to the great Theocrat, let December’s &quot;Great Multitude” Testimony Period find each faithful servant pushing the work with renewed vigor and delight as the effective period of the new arrangement outlined in Brother Rutherford's letter of October 24, 1911, begins. Those of the remnant, together with the ever-increasing band of those companions who eagerly look forward to becoming a part of the &quot;great multitude&quot;, now unitedly surge forward in a new campaign that will reveal thousands more who will join them and also go to make up the “great multitude”. How appropriately December is the &quot;Great Miu.titude” Testimony Period I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Going out as strong as ever, the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font1"> make up the combination to be offered during this month. This literature is best introduced by the use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of the doorstep</span><span class="font1"> setup and the new record “Children”. Continue to follow up all placements of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> with regular back-calls. Use the record “Theocracy”. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lieport of the Jehovah's witnesses Assembly </span><span class="font1">will further arouse their interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at it diligently as outlined in the November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> All will work their territory, make their back-calls, conduct their model studies and book studies faithfully, and if something must give way in order to care for this additional responsibility, let it be some worldly or temporal interests rather than the Kingdom or eternal interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are three classes of publishers now : special publishers, general publishers (pioneers) and general publishers (company workers). The requirements for each group are a burden placed upon them by the Lord. Special publishers must meet the requirement of 175 hours and 50 back-calls a month. General publishers (pioneers) are obligated to meet the 150-hour requirement and other features of the Kingdom service in proportion, while the general publisher (company worker) has a quota of GO hours and 12 back-calls a month and as much in addition as it is possible for him to do. With each one recognizing that and doing his part, it will undoubtedly result in a tremendous witness to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The time has come when each one of the Lord's people is entering into the limit stages of the battle; consequently it behooves all to walk close to the Lord, walk circumspectly, and show kindness, mercy and loving devotion to all who are of good-will; and this can be done only by adhering strictly to the Lord's direction and accepting such burdens as the Lord has placed in our hands to be used for this purpose. The literature and phonograph recordings are all a part of the great arrangement which the Lord has given us in order to properly bear our burden before Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your every opportunity should now be used in directing the attention of the meek to the study of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font1"> Take advantage of their holidays and your own. Let us aid them in learning how they may have a part in the privileges to be enjoyed by the &quot;great multitude”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Holidays common to this time of the year provide marvelous opportunities of field service. Many of the young publishers who attend schools will have at least one full week which may be devoted to Theocratic ser\ ice. Parents will not send them to movies, but will take their children with them in the service and teach them that which is right. There is every reason why December should see everyone publishing the message of The Tiinocj’.\cy and a new peak reached. Do your part.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1942 Calendar</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The new calendar published for Jehovah's witnesses is now ready. Company servants should order those wanted by the publishers. Remittance must accompany order. The calendar is 25c, five or more to the same address at 20c each. Do not order the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> until announced. Order only the calendar, with other literature, at this time.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Placing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Some publishers in the field have written in their experiences to the effect that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book can be placed in the Heid easily if the ob-tainer is told about the three weeks' study course. Olliers have found, too, that when they mention the study course in advance more interest is shown in this course when people receive it in the mail. These suggestions may be helpful to others in placing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book and preparing for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies later. Try it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">80,000 Publishers Expected in 1942</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>19,000,000 Hours Quota for Field Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">As long as the Lord favors his people with opportunities of service they should plan to press on with the work with greater zeal and devotion than at any time heretofore. Therefore we look to 1942 as another’ year of rich blessing ; and, with the Lord’s favor and His permission, a greater witness will be given than at any time in the past. The new work which Brother Rutherford has already outlined for 1042, if properly cared for, will undoubtedly result in a greater witness for the Kingdom than could be accomplished in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During 1941 there was an average of 56,745 publishers in the field. This included company and pioneer publishers. It is anticipated that during 1942 the average number of publishers in the held will be 60,500 company publishers and 5,500 fulltime publishers; or an average total of 66,000 witnesses for the Kingdom</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“Watchtower” Campaign</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Prepare Now</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>for Testimony Period</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">It is a joyous privilege to here announce the good news that February 1, 1942, will inaugurate another </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. This campaign will be three months in duration. including February, March and April, and will be curried on in every country on the face of the earth where the IF </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">at eh to w e r</span><span class="font1"> magazine may be distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These campaigns have always been looked forward to with great enthusiasm by the Theocratic publishers. and those who are veterans of the past campaigns deeply appreciate the significance of this announcement at this time. Each publisher must get ready. Last year's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Campaign seemed to get off to a very slow start, for some reason. However, it finished at high speed. But this time we trust it will get going with a fast start. When February 1 rolls around everyone is going to be ready to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The special offer is a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of $1.00, with a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> (or any other bound book) and of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font1"> as a premium. All publishers should cheek their stocks of literature and their distributors’ copies of magazines, ascertain their needs as to the record “Instruction” (P-154), which introduces </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font1">obtain a supply of subscription slips and subscription record sheets, and get everything in readiness for what should be the best </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch to wer </span><span class="font1">Campaign we have ever had. This campaign will include all foreign-language magazines available; so plan io cover your foreign sections too. Order supplies and arrange your equipment now. Further information will appear in the next </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Info rmant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">each month. It is hoped that in some one month in 1942 we shall reach a new (&gt;eak of 80,900 publishers; and to this end we will strive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hour Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having in mind the new work, the privileges of service, and the increased number of publishers, it is anticipated that during the year 19,000.000 hours will be devoted to field service by this average of 66,000 publishers; which average we have not as yet reached as a peak, but there have been over 64.000 publishers for the past two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All companies should arrange their charts as they have in previous years, and set out their quotas of publishers (which should be an increase of 2-&gt; percent over their last year's peak), and strive diligently to increase their average of hours and back-calls. With a greater effort on the part of the servants of the King, and, above all, the Lord’s rich blessing, 1942 will be an outstanding year of advertising the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Work Your Individual Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Clearly it is Jehovah’s will that each consecrated servant now bear his own burden. Therefore let each and every publisher be responsible for his individual territory and work ths same in accord with the method set out in Brother Rutherford’s letter of October 24, which states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Each publisher being assigned a respective territory will fully and thoroughly work that territory . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Every home in that territory must be called upon ; and for this reason you should divide your territory into small sections and work out each section separately and thoroughly. Do not pass by any house without giving a witness. . . . Where-ever interest is shown, keep the name and address of each home, and the occupants showing an interest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In times past, territories have been divided into small sections or assignments by the companies, and various publishers have, from time to time, gone through these sections in a superficial manner, leaving much literature and making a few back-calls here and there. Certain publishers have grouped together and spent a few hours a month witnessing in a certain territory and then gone on to another, never following through with the good-will interest. Henceforth, however, each publisher will have his individual assignment and assume full responsibility for the people in that section and will see to it that every person therein is given an opportunity to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cities and towns should receive first attention now. By this time all companies should have divided their thickly populated territories into small sections for individual assignment to publishers. Each publisher should hold one or more of these individual assignments near his home, according to the amount of time he is able to put in. If two publishers wisli to work one section, let them divide it, and each take care of his portion. If car groups desire to work together, let each individual obtain his assignment of a few blocks in tlie same community and be responsible for thoroughly working his assignment by himself. Car drivers can place each publisher in liis territory and return at a designated time to pick him up after witnessing. Small towns may be divided into four or live sections and assigned to a car group, each publisher taking a section. In no case does it now appear proper for two publishers to go to the same house, or even work every other house, or on the same block, but rather let each have his own separate territory and cover that territory at least four times. You are sure to find some interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thoroughness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The objective in working your territory should be that of becoming thoroughly acipiainted with every resident's attitude toward the truth. Do not pass by any house without giving the witness. It seems best that each one equip himself with a small notebook or pad and mark down the results at each door. Where people are not at home when you call, go back the very next time you are in the territory and follow through until you do find them at home and give the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After going over your territory once you will have some idea of where the interest is. However, work it again and again with tlie same thoroughness, keeping track of the results and following through on the interest. Undoubtedly you will meet other members of the various households ; some may be interested, others not; but keep an accurate record of all interest on regular back-call slips and organize your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies wherever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Eventually, when new publishers start out as a result of your efforts, it will be proper to take them with you for a short time until they learn how to carry on the work; and then give them a portion of your territory or another section near by and let them be responsible for working that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In cases where interest is found among foreign-speaking people in your territory who cannot read the English, if you can speak their language it would be well to take the latest book available in their language and organize a study similar to the studies arranged amongst the English-speaking people with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font1"> If and when the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> is published in their language, then immediately discontinue the use of the older book and switch to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font1"> Do not neglect the people of good-will amongst foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not look to some other publisher to do your job for you, “but let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.” —Gal. 0: 4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Phonographs and New Records</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Orders have been received at the Brooklyn ollice for approximately 5,000 new phonographs. No more orders for the new phonographs will be accepted by the Society until we are assured that parts can be obtained for more. We have been successful in completing approximately 1,500 of the 5,000 the brethren have ordered, and these are shipped out. As fast as we are able to make more we will till the other orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of conditions in the world now, it might be that we shall not be able to get certain parts, particularly motors. Therefore the Society does not want to accept orders for an additional number of phonographs. Brethren needing and wanting phonographs may, if they wish, get the best phonograph in stores that will accommodate a 12-inch record and use this in their back-call work. Tlie Society suggests that where phonographs are obtained in the open market the quality be checked to compare somewhere favorably with that of the Society’s before tlie publisher makes the purchase, so that the reproduction of the talks will be pleasing to the listeners. The Society will inform Ilie publishers as soon as it is assured it can get more-suitable motors and supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Deliveries of records by the manufacturers have been very slow. Nearly 5,000 complete sets of the series of three lectures have already been shipped out, and five thousand more complete sets are expected within tlie next 30 or 40 days. Until these records come in, all those who have not yet received their orders must be patient. Thousands of orders are on hand, and these we will till just as quickly as we receive records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Take good care of the records you have, as they are daily becoming more difficult to obtain. Companies that have ordered </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> books with records, if you need a supply of books quickly, send in an airmail letter for literature only and these will be given immediate attention ahead of your record order. In many instances, we have already shipped Hie books, where the weight was over 100 pounds, and have held up your orders for records because of no supply.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>64,469 Publishers in October</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The new fiscal year of the Society began witli October, 1941, and from the report we find that a new peak for full-time workers was reached, namely, 5,033. To this we can add 59,436 company publishers engaging in the field work. During the “Lightning-War” Testimony Period these brethren placed 238,206 bound books, most of which were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One thing that needs close attention on the part of every witness for the Kingdom is the back-call work. There were only 294,218 back-calls made during the month of October, whereas in 1940, by not as many publishers, 329,833 back-calls were made. The company publishers fell away down on their average, to 2.9 back-calls per publisher. Everyone should check his record and see to it that he is improving in the back-call work. If the publishers properly follow up</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Used Cartons</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">It is becoming more difficult daily to obtain materials, regardless of what they are, and the Lord’s people should be conserving everything they can. Every company servant and stock keeper, as well as pioneers, should study the following closely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Used cartons in fairly good condition can be used again by the Society. Paper tape should be neatly torn off after cartons have been emptied, and tlie cartons then be broken down flat. Labels should be crossed out. Cartons should be folded flat so that the corner with cloth tape is in the center. Make bundles of 20 cartons each, keeping the different sizes in separate bundles. These cartons should be stored until you have at least 100 pounds. “DO” or “A” cartons weigh approximately 2<sup>,</sup>/<sub>1</sub> lb. each ; so it would take approximately 2% or 3 bundles of 20 cartons each before shipment is made by rail freight to Watchtower, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, care of Fulton Terminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Describe the shipment as follows : Three (3) bundles cartons KD 135 lb. The above address applies to companies east of the Mississippi river. Companies west thereof, should first notify Brooklyn about quantity on hand, so we can determine whether it would pay to have the cartons shipped to Brooklyn or to depots where they can later be reshipped. Where there are small companies using only a few cartons, they might be delivered to some near-by larger company from time to time when one of tlie brethren goes to that city, and a large shipment later may be made; thus saving the brethren money, as well as the Society. Your co-operation will effect a considerable saving, and will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Requesting Credit on Study Courses Mailed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">There have been some discrepancies appearing in the report cards already received in the ollice. We therefore outline below some points for your guidance in requesting credit for study courses mailed out.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Credit will be entered and appear on your monthly statement once every three months. Do not write requesting credit any earlier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. No credit will be allowed unless proper request is made on your report card each month so that the request can be properly checked against the literature placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Each credit requested is for 4%c. That means sufficient credit for mailing the entire three folders. Some are requesting 4^c credit for each folder mailed. This is wrong. Request credit only for each complete series; for the 4%c covers the postage on the three folders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">4. The number of requests for credit should never exceed the number of Children books placed by the company, and should usually be less because of I those courses delivered personally and I cases where the publishers desire to </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book placements and make the back-calls and arrange for the study of the book, their reports for back-calls made should greatly increase during the coming months. We look to December for a new peak in number of back-calls for all publishers—special and general. Consider carefully the table below and be sure to do your part. Compare these averages with your individual report and company averages. Are you better or lower?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Mailing of Study Course</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Inquiries have been made as to how the study course can be mailed for 1c instead of 1 !£e. The law as copied from the Postal Laws and Regulations, Section 562, is set out below. Where there are large companies and their mailings of study courses amount to 200 identical pieces each week, and mailed at the same time, these companies can take advantage of this Postal Law and Regulation; however, some competent brother will have to check with the local post office and obtain the proper permission and forms which must be made out in connection with this mail. The Society publishes the following for general information:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pound Rate for Bulk Mailings of Third-Class Matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(From P L &amp;&nbsp;R No. 562) . . . it shall be lawful to accept for transmission in the mails, without postage stamps or with precanceled stamps affixed, separately addressed identical pieces of third-class matter in quantities of not less than twenty pounds, or of not less than two hundred pieces subject to pound rates of postage applicable to the entire bulk mailed at one time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">3. (b) When the postage on third-class matter mailed under the provisions of this section is paid by means of precanceled stamps, each separately addressed piece shall bear such printed indicia as may be prescribed by the Third Assistant Postmaster General to show that the matter is being so mailed.</span></p></li>

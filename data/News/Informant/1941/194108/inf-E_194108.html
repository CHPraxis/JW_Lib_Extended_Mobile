<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as a Pioneer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>You Can Start After Convention</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">During the hist few months several hundred new publishers have enrolled for full-time Theocratic service, greatly increasing the pioneer ranks, but yet «e do not have 5.000 in Ilie United States alone. Our goal is 7,0001 Can we do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Have jou carefully considered jour opportunities to become a fulltime ambassador for The Theocratic Government as did the men and women whom the apostle enumerates in the 11th chapter of Hebrews? Have you carelully considered his next-spoken words, in chapter 12, verses 1 and 2?—“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no doubt that many have given some consideration to this matter in the past, but how many’ have reconsidered this vital issue in light of recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> articles? To every true servant of Jehovah, whether of the anointed or of the “great multitude”, the above text means much more today than ever before, and the faithful servant appreciates that the days are limited in which one may' give full-time devotion to the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has revealed that these weights include everything that retards, prevents or hinders one in advancing the interests of The Theocratic Government. The term “religion”, “the sin which doth so easily beset us,” is not limited to the worshiping of other gods or practicing formalism, but Includes all things that Interfere with the announcing of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you have some weights that you can now lay aside, enabling you to enroll as a pioneer? If you have no weights at all and have not enrolled, what is keeping you from sending in for your pioneer application immediately? No individual can tell you how many of these weights you can completely lay aside or which ones you can adjust so that you can run the race, but the matter is between you and the Lord, as stated in Psalm 2(1:2: “Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.” Upon a careful and prayerful consideration of pioneer service, it may be that many of your previous weights can be done away with and others altered, thus giving you the opportunity to make application as a pioneer, a full-time publisher, that is. one who can devote 150 hours or more a month in advertising the King and the Kingdom and aiding the &quot;other sheep&quot; of the Lord to find the only means of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be a pioneer does not mean that you must throw over everything, gel a car mid a trailer and travel all over the country. You can work right at home. The time ele-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">75,000 Coming to St. Louis!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Mode of Travel Being Used </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tremendous Preparations Under Way for Theocratic Assembly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Extraordinary Witness to Be Given</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">If expressions in the mail of appreciation, and what they are going to do, and who are coming to St. Louis—are any indication of what is going to happen in St. Louis, then we can saj’ that 75,000 persons, from all parts of the United States, will be there to share in this assembly for worship. The 1941 Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses promises to be the greatest assembly ever on earth of the servants of the King. Information comes from every part of the country that “we are bringing our children”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">T ransportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the New England states special trains will be coming. From the west they report getting special buses and equipping them for traveling a long distance. In the eastern states thousands have made reservations on the streamliners. Thousands upon thousands of automobiles will be tilled up by “all publishers”, and they will soon be rolling to St. Louis. Zone servants and company’ servants everywhere are co-operating one with another, making it possible for our brethren to attend. It is a joy to our hearts to see the unity of action on the part of everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Field Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everyone at the convention who is not engaged in some other activity nient is the first step to consider; and if you can devote 150 hours a month to the Kingdom work, then the other determining factors should be easily arranged. Recent pioneer instructions pointed out that it is best for pioneers to stay in the same assignment of territory rather than move from place to place. This means that whether you have a home and family, or whether you are staying with parents or relatives, you can still enroll as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a continual need for more pioneers in all sections of the country, and at present a great number of companies not'd pioneer assistance. Pioneers are the backbone of Ilie companies, doing a great amount of work in building up the interest in the territory and aiding new publishers with the phonograph, back-calls, model studies, and magazine work. Now is the time to take advantage of every opportunity’ to engage in the pioneer service. We are confident that Jehovah's richest blessing will be with every publisher as he takes definite action to enroll as a pioneer. Write at once for j’our pioneer application or begin Io enjoy the blessings and privileges of fulltime service at the Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that must of necessity’ be done to keep the convention moving should spend some time in the field service. There are many fields of activity, such as door-to-door witnessing using the phonograph, magazine work on the street corners, information walkers, distributing handbills advertising the public meeting, soundcars, working rurals, witnessing in business territory, and inviting everybody to come to hear the lectures “Comfort All That Mourn&quot;, on Saturday, and &quot;Children of The King”, on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Come prepared with magazine bags and witnessing cases. The magazines to be used are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer,</span><span class="font2"> August 1 issue, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Connotation</span><span class="font2"> No. 571. Both of these magazines have special notices of the convention activity’ and should be used exclusively in the field work in St. Louis and vicinity. If you receive your issue of each before coming to file convention you can bring them with you and place them on the way. Other supplies can be, obtained in St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service Booth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the brethren who are physically able will want to work in the cafeteria, bookroom, dish cleaning, refreshment stands, or other places where work needs to be done. It is expected that more than 3,009 volunteers will be required. Only those who can do hard work for the duration of the convention should volunteer for this service by registering at the Volunteer Service</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Study Organization</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Is Your Company Well Organized?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">By this time each company should have its territory well organized for book studies. Book studies should be accessible to the people of goodwill throughout the assignment. The majority of the companies started this arrangement going after the matter was called to their attention in the November, 1939, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">In/ormant. </span><span class="font2">and have had excellent results both in the development of the Kingdom interests and in caring for the people of good-will in their area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies that do not have their territory thoroughly organized for book studies should get busy on this immediately. Arrange for book studies at strategic points throughout the territory’ accessible to a reasonable number of publishers and the people of good-will. Have the study conductor look after the Kingdom booth. If any can work in the cafeteria it would be well for them to bring with them clean aprons or other apparel that would be convenient dress for dish collecting or dish cleaning, having in mind the work for which they desire to volunteer. All zone servants are requested to report to the Volunteer Service booth, and they, will be assigned to a work already designated by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“New Pioneers”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Numerous letters have been received at the office from the brethren saying that they are going to sign up for the pioneer work at the convention. A special booth will be opened for this purpose. Look for the banner “New Pioneebs”. Already’ 4,400 pioneers are signed up and working in the full-time service, and it is expected that by the end of the convention our grand total will be over 5,000. Will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font2"> be a pioneer by the end of the Theocratic Assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tremendous preparations are under way to make this the most blessed assembly you have ever attended. The rooming committee is working day and night to add to your comfort. Up to the 15th of July over 10,000 persons have written for accommodations, and each day’s mail now brings from 1,700 to 2,000 requests for rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the servants of the Lord are praying for and looking toward the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">interests in that area. He should be given the assignment of territory adjacent to the study, a list of the back-call names in the area, and of model studies and publishers. He would be responsible for supervising the activity in that particular section from that time forth, under the supervision of the regular company’ servants, of course. He would have one night for his study, then arrange for an evening for back-call work, and time for regular witnessing and magazine work and generally developing the interest in the entire area, working all new interest from back-calls and model studies into the book studies, and also directing this new interest to attend the general headquarters II </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">atehtower</span><span class="font2"> study and service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fall is the best time of the year for this type of service.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Two New Peaks Reached</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">'Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period Marvelous</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Jehovah Pours Out Rich Blessing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In June 1940 we reached a new peak in publishers, just passing the 58,000 mark. In June 1941, the “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period, a new all-time peak was reached of 64,302 publishers engaging in the witness work in the United States alone. Two new peaks were established in which all the publishers are interested, namely, the new peak of company publishers, 60,055, and a new peak in full-time publishers of 4,247. (This includes the pioneers, special pioneers and zone servants.) This should bring joy and delight to the hearts of everyone who had a share in this grand and glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only have we reached the greatest number of publishers in the field at any one time, but the company publishers reached a new high this year in the average hours in the field. Their previous high for the year was 16.3, last month, but in June they averaged 17 hours. We are still behind the all-time peak of June 1940, when the company publishers averaged 20.3 hours during the month; however, the greatest month of witnessing for the King and Kingdom was June 1941, because this can be measured only in hours in the field, and the grand total of hours spent in witnessing was 1,529,621. This undoubtedly will bring much joy and gladness of heart to every participant, knowing that they shared in the singing of praises unto the Most High, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bound Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witness to the Kingdom can be best appreciated by the number of hours put in the field work, which shows a marked increase over any</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Pure Language” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Tops the Month</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Your Literature Should Have Been Ordered by This Time</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The people of the Most High God, Jehovah, are now in the day when, as commanded by Him, they must put forth a supreme effort in publishing the Theocratic message. A recent issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Watchtower </span><span class="font2">clearly sets out the obligation resting upon the shoulders of the Theocratic ambassadors. It states, “Today the Lord is gathering unto himself his ‘other sheep’, that is, those who love righteousness and who hate evil. To such the instruction comes from God’s Word, -and is given to such sincere ones: ‘For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain liis tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it’ (11’et. 3:10,11) That rule applies both to the remnant and to the ‘other sheep’ of the Lord. . . . The wise man does not desire to follow his selfish inclinations.... He will look up to the Lord for his guide, shield and protection. He will have his mind and heart set upon the Lord and be praying at all times that he may be guided in the way of righteousness.” Tims it is seen other time, but it can also be tangibly measured by the amount of literature placed. The “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Feriod was a month for bound books, and during this one month 64,302 publishers placed in the field 626,692 clothbound books. This large total was greatly aided because of the special offer of three bound books on a contribution of 35c. We rejoice that the literature was placed in the homes, where it will be read and will bring comfort to those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are still three more reports to be compiled, July, August, and September. Every one of the publishers who is serving The Theoc-uacy is anxious to know when our quota or peak for 1941 will be reached, namely, 70,600 publishers in the field in one month. With tile steady increase of publishers as from January, 1941, when there were 50,-T44 in the field, up until June, when 64,302 were in (he field, it will not be long until tiie 70,000 quota is reached, we firmly believe. We look to August, the “pt'KE Language” Testimony Period, for this “new peak” month in which the Lord will pour out upon His people His rich blessing. We are all praying for and looking forward to the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">that all must serve the Lord unitedly with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a “pure language”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our work for the month of August begins with the convention. Lach publisher should be prepared and equipped to give a witness at every opportunity on tiie way to and from the convention at St. Louis. All should therefore be on tiie alert, keep a good record of the time and placements made en route, and, as promptly as possible, turn in their reports to their company servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tiie offer will be the same as outlined in the July </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant;</span><span class="font2"> that is, the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heliyion</span><span class="font2"> and one booklet, on a 25c contribution. From that offer drop to the three-booklet combination, on a 10c contribution, if they are unable to take the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Helinion.</span><span class="font2"> Those persons who cannot afford either of these combinations should be left a booklet on any contribution they can give, or free if they cannot afford a contribution but promise to read. Something should be left in every home, if possible. Leave a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> or meeting announcement folder where the people do not take any of the books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Your Magazine Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The magazine work should be participated in consistently by all publishers. Many people who do not obtain the magazines on the streets, for various reasons, are pleased to procure copies when tiie publishers call in the house - to - house work. Therefore no one should become discouraged if he places but one or two copies every time he goes out. Every company should continue to keep a good supply of both magazines on order and take care of their magazine account with the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Routes : These seem to have been neglected by some. When you engage in the evening work, why not take along a few copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Walch-lower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> and explain the route arrangement to people who show interest? Place copies wherever possible, and keep a record of the addresses. When the next issue is ready for distribution call again. Also take note of tiie interested in your regular witness work and put them on your magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company, therefore, should get thoroughly organized now, so that from September 1, at the very</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">70,000 Publishers! When?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Some Interesting Facts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tiie fiscal year 1941 is almost over; only two more months, August and .September, left and we have not attained to our peak of 70,000 publishers. There does not seem to be any good reason why we should not have that many publishers in the field. There are 80,515 different individuals associated with the companies; there are nearly 4,500 pioneel’s, zone and regional servants; there are over 50,000 good-will people attending model studies; all of which makes a grand total of over 135,000 people. Surely there should be 70,000 publishers among all of these I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the next two months undoubtedly tiie Lord is going to bestow a great blessing upon His peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Equlpment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For tliis Testimony Period all companies and pioneers should have already sent in their order for what stock of literature they will need, as instructed in the July </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font2">as the factory will be closed from August 1 to 20. Use the phonograph witli the “Message of Hope” record and the doorstep setup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As has been stated time and again, this phase of the work eannot be overemphasized. It would be well to occasionally review the article “Back-Calls and Model Studies” appearing in the April (1941) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Publishers already engaged in back-call and model-study work and pioneers working in company territory should endeavor to do all that they possibly can to assist all the other publishers in the company to regularly engage in this important work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rur.il Teri Kory</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All companies should carefully plan and see to it that their rural territory is thoroughly covered, and all interest found should be followed up and Inken care of as efficiently as possible, by groups or otherwise. Pioneer publishers working in conjunction with companies should cooperate in this respect, and assist in every way possible in working latest, their organization in this respect will be working smoothly in caring for all features of the Kingdom interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Vertical-Type Phonograph</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The vertical-type phonograph introduced and demonstrated at tiie Theocratic Convention last year has been held up in production, due to the difficulty in obtaining necessary materials for its manufacture. Finally we have been able to secure a small supply of all the parts required, and we are manufacturing now. It is hoped that we shall have a supply at the St. Louis assembly, which the brethren may obtain upon the contribution of $12. It is suggested Hint no orders be sent in to Brooklyn until after the convention. Orders will be filled in the order in which they are received, and remittance must accompany all orders. Records are not included with the machine; so order your requirements. It is very interesting to note that this announcement can be made during the month of July, for which the calendar text is Judges 3 : 26. 27. Let us unitedly “sound the trumpet”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">pie. Everyone who loves the Lord will want to show his appreciation of tliis, and the least we can do to show our appreciation is to devote some time to the Lord’s Kingdom service. This can be done despite tiie fact that coming to, attending and returning from the convention will to some extent Interfere with the field service of many. However, the impetus and blessing that will be attained at the convention should more than offset that. This divergence from the regular routine may be accepted as a special opportunity to witness to different people and under different circumstances en route. Witness to everybody you have occasion to talk to or do business with, in hotels, restaurants, auto camps, filling stations, in fact, everybody. Keep track of the time and report it through your local company servant, for August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everybody should be a publisher now, young and old, great and small. If you do not return home before the end of the month, mail your report to your company servant so that he can include it in his report for tiie month. Let our slogan be “Everyone a publisher, and 70,000 publishers for August and September”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the current year there was a very steady average maintained. We have continued with over 60,000 publishers a month for the past several months, which shows a steady consistency on the part of those who are actively engaged in the Kingdom service now. These ranks should be definitely augmented with new publishers from August on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the rural territory. The convention will fire up tiie zeal of all the Lord’s people and give greater strength and joy in the fight for The Theocracy by lifting high the banner of truth against the wicked elements that are now destroying the earth. Now the covenant people of Jehovah have ‘one language’, and it is pure; they have a clear vision of the great Theocratic. Government, which is the only hope for tiie people, and they have tiie instruments of warfare the Lord has provided through his organization; and the obligation rests upon each one of them to put on the full armor and fight, as the Lord has commanded in his Word. Will the “Rube Language” Testimony Period bring to the fore an even greater army of willing volunteers singing the praises of Jehovah, the Almighty God?</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly for Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">70,000 Expected at St. Louis</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thousands of Children Coming!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Everyone a Publisher!!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">It is a joy to our hearts that the Lord has again arranged for (he assembly of his people to worship Jehovah God in spirit and in truth. It is very manifest that the Lord is directing his people to assemble at St. Louis, and He undoubtedly has a great blessing in store for everyone who puts forth an effort to get there and share in the joys of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On June 25 the Society mailed to all company servants a supply of the 16-page booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Assembly for Worship.</span><span class="font1"> A copy of this booklet is to be given to each publisher, so that each may be fully informed of the details of the convention which are set out in this booklet and should be considered thoroughly by everyone of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On June Id a letter was sent by the president of the Society to the consecrated parents who have minor children. Reports from many parts of the country show that all consecrated parents are putting forth a special effort to bring their children who are serving the Lord and honoring Uis name. It is noted, too, that a day, Sunday, August 10, is set aside as “Children’s Day”, and a special assembly of children is arranged, according to the program. And, most important, Brother Rutherford will be talking on the subject “Children of The King”. From all the information that has been sent out it is quite manifest that there is a rich blessing in store for the children, and thousands </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1">these young folks desiring to honor the Lord's name ami having a keen appreciation of what is being done by the Lord in the earth at this time are putting forth every effort to come to this Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has also furnished letters and, in the booklet mentioned above, details concerning transportation, and every company servant or brother appointed to look after transportation should look well to this part </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> the organization. Some sections of the country are arranging special trains. Many have ordered special cars and have reserved large sections on streamlined trains. Thousands upon thousands will be coming by auto, bus, trailer, truck, and every other means. The important thing, however, is for each company to arrange for as many persons as can possibly attend to get there. Zone servants and company servants in all areas will immediately cooperate one with another to see that the transportation of the brethren to the convention is properly handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These faithful brethren who are devoting all their time to the work of The Theocracy will be coming WO-percent strong. An identification card and letter setting out special privileges for the pioneers have been sent to each of them. They should be on the lookout for this letter if not already received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work of the Lord's people since 1D22 has been primarily ‘Advertise the King and the Kingdom’. Much advertising by means of handbills, placards, posters, streetcar advertising, door-to-door witnessing, back-calls, sound-cars and large banners will be carried on in St. Louis and vicinity. Brethren should come to the convention prepared with their book bags, magazine bags, phonographs, and other equipment necessary for the carrying on of well-organized held activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Silk Screen Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large companies that have silk screen equipment will be privileged to make banners for their cars to advertise the meeting at St. Louis. These can be mounted on cars before leaving, or, if it would interfere with driving, bring the signs along and put them on the car as soon as arriving in the vicinity of Missouri or St. Louis. It is suggi sled that every company or zone I hat has silk screen equipment make banners of the convenient size and furnish them io the company or to other brethren in the zone that request them. The wording of these signs made locally should be as follows. No one has the authority to make tiny changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wording of signs for silk screen posters:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Hear</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>JUDGE RUTHERFORD</span></h4>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The ARENA</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Saturday the 9th 3 p.m.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">“COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sunday, August 10 11 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“CHILDREN OF THE KING&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All Persons of Good-Will Welcome</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">FREE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">FREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You will note that the public meeting is on Saturday, at 3 p.m., and the subject, “Comfort All That Mourn.&quot; In arrangement of the sign special prominence should be given to this feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Undoubtedly there are many good sign painters in the various companies throughout the country, and they can design and work up a very beautiful and attractive sign for cars and buses they are using (if allowed to mount these signs on buses while traveling). The arrangement and colors of the design we leave to the discretion of each company, but the wording as set out above will be identical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Any companies that have extra signs may bring them along to the convention, so that they may be put to good use. The expense involved in making these signs should be taken care of locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the Lord’s grace and under his direction, St. Louis and vicinity will have I he greatest witness that lias been given to the name of the Lord. &quot;The people shall know that Jehovah is God.’ Knowing our commission of now aiding all the people of good-will, the publishers of The Theocracy will have great joy in again assembling with one another and receiving from the Lord's hands refreshing truths and having the great privilege of taking forward these truths to the people of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> has brought lo our attention, in tiie following words, that which we should all keep in mind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Throughout the entire earth the people now mourn and many are seeking that which would bring them comfort. Jehovah has commissioned His people to ‘comfort all that mourn’. AU who are fully devoted to Jehovah will be diligent to fulfill that divinely given commission. As the consecrated journey to and from I he convention, and while there, each one should be diligent to render comfort to those who have a hearing ear, desiring to know of God's gracious provisions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are looking forward to seeing you at the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses. St. Louis, Missouri, August 6-10, 1941.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>No. 4 Sound Equipment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Those who have the No. 4 Sound Equipment furnished by the Society and which equipmert is in good condition and working order, and who definitely intend to attend the assembly at .St. Louis, please write the Society. Convention Desk, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, stating the date you expect to arrive at St. Louis and whether you are willing to offer your equipment for use in public-address work on the grounds. Also state whether you will have competent operators with the ear who will attend for the full live days. If. a'ter you have written the Society, further information is required we shall write you.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>More than 350 New Pioneers Enrolled During June</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">That sounds very good, doesn’t it? But if we are to reach our hope for 7,000 American pioneers that number should be more than doubled each month for the next several months. We believe it will be done, by the Lord's grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pioneer letter of June 16,1941, has been mailed to all companies and zone servants for the encouragement of all Theocratic publishers. All have studied the series of articles on the Victory Song of Barak and Deborah and are rejoicing in the clear understanding of Hie same. This letter hits the high points and proves to all that you really can't afford not being a pioneer. It speaks for itself, and that is why we can’t go into detail about it. You will understand what we mean when you hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fifteen minutes should be set aside in a service meeting during the month, for its careful study, and it should be carefully and clearly read at the close Of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Can You Use a Few?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">There are 10,400 copies of the 1940 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Messenyer</span><span class="font1"> in stock, which should be used as soon as possible. These can be used to a good advantage in back-calls and to convey to new interest the magnitude of the Theocratic Convention. This should be an inducement to have them come to St. Louis. These can be had at lc a copy. It would be appreciated if the companies and pioneers would check up to see if a small supply could be handled by them, and include it in your order as soon as possible. We are sure that if all will do this the number of copies will soon be reduced.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Wash Your Bags</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The demand for magazine bags has become great, far exceeding the number of magazine publishers in the country. This indicates that many publishers throw their bags away when the bags become soiled or dirty. This should not be done. Wash your magazine bags.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the Society is glad to assist the brethren as much as possible by providing these instruments of warfare, these brethren who will not wash their bags are placing an unnecessary burden on the Society by demanding more bags. There is only a limited number of brethren at Bethel, and. with the various features of the Kingdom work that must be cared for there, the demand on their time is very great. If the brethren, therefore, will look after their bags and cut down on the orders, it will greatly assist. Of I course, it is always proper to order magazine bags when needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the increasing cost of material, commencing July first, the price of these bags will be 20c each.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Sound the Trumpet</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Your Sound Equipment </span><span class="font2">Judges 3:26,27: “Ehud escaped . . . he blew a trumpet in the mountain.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is our text for the month of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Waichloiecr</span><span class="font1"> has revealed to us the significance of the Ehud picture. When one part of this picture was terminated, Ehud did not go away somewhere and lie down, but rather with great enthusiasm and vigor laid hold of the next feature of the work. Just preceding the sounding of the trumpet he had slain Eglon. lied to the borders of Israel, and immediately busied himself admonishing his brethren to further and greater service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah's willing volunteers now have just finished the greatest </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font1"> campaign to date, as outlined in another part of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> and, instead of desiring to rest on their laurels, the true servants of the Most High are anxious to find out what is next in order for Kingdom service. During the month of July the offer to be presented to the people is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heliyion </span><span class="font1">and one of the latest booklets, on a contribution of 25c. The sounding of the trumpet pictures the Lord, through his people, declaring to all those of his organization and the people of good-will their Kingdom responsibilities. Therefore the placing of the message in printed form in the hands of the people, the use of the phonograph and doorstep setup using the many records supplied us by the Lord's organization, and the publication of the Kingdom message with magazines and in other ways, are all a part of this work of trumpet-sounding that the Lord is now doing through his people. Let all his willing volunteers, therefore, joyfully continue to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As outlined in the June </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> each publisher should very easily place five of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jlelir/ion </span><span class="font1">during the month, and a large number of booklets. Where the people are unable to take the bound book and booklet on a contribution of 25c, drop to three booklets, on a ll)c contribution. If the jieople are interested, but unable to contribute, then leave the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State </span><span class="font1">booklet with them on the understanding that they are to read it, and try to make arrangements for a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many of the brethren will, during the latter part of the month, be traveling to the convention. This should not unduly interrupt their Kingdom service. En route to the convention witness to and comfort all that mourn. Gasoline stations, restaurants, hotels, boarding houses and auto camps make excellent witnessing territory. Many of these places are not accessible to publishers generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchloircr</span><span class="font1"> says, concerning tins portion of the prophecy: “This part of the prophetic drama, therefore, shows that God's strange work will be carried on in some part of the earth until the time for the beginning of the strange act, the battle of the great day of God Almighty.” It seems to be the joyful prospect of the Lord's people in the United States and England to enjoy this great privilege along with all our brethren throughout the world. They are not slacking their hands. Let us, therefore, as Ehud did, utilize our deliverance by the Lord by accepting our responsibility, being witnesses to the glory of His</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Although the month of May was not a special testimony period for the Lord's servants, his faithful witnesses went forward under the Scriptural admonition, “willingly offered themselves” (Judges 5:2,9), and, by the grace of the Most High, reached a new all-time peak in the number of publishers in the field during any one month. The total for May was bl.571 publishers. What a fitting climax for the final month of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiier</span><span class="font1"> Campaign!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Doth pioneer and company publishers reached a new high, thus making the new peak 01.571. Company publishers totaled 57,010, which is the first peak in publishers since the mark made in June, 1940. The pioneer record was 3.955. The placement of books and booklets for May 1941 was 11:;,007 books mid 1.280,75!) booklets, to compare with 109,729 and 1,025,222 for May 1940.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Pure Language” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">August Work Starts Off with Convention</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Get Orders for Literature In Early</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Today’ the people of Jehovah, devoting themselves to the interests of the great Theocratic Got nr.x.ME.vr, are a people with a pure language. The law of Jehovah is written in their hearts. They are blind to every thing except The Theocb icy, knowing that the only thing worth while is to look well to the interests of that government, which will progress and expand and fill the whole earth, and all tlie enemies of Jehovah will perish. Although during the month of August much time will be taken for travel to and from the convention, nevertheless to redeem the time no opportunities should be allowed to slip by without giving a witness. Therefore be well prepared to do as much work as possible en route to and from the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be sure to take along a good supply of magazines for distribution in the business places whenever possible. When you can, use the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The offer during this testimony period will bo the same as that used in July; that is. the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iteliiiion </span><span class="font1">and one booklet, on a contribution name, and by participating in this campaign with all zeal and vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Good News</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new ‘trumpet’ that was announced at the last convention, the vertical-type phonograph, is about ready for shipment. We are still held up because of failure of delivery of one part. But we hope to get a fair supply all ready for St. Louis. By the Lord's grace, we shall have them there for demonstration and be able to place quite a number with the brethren for use in the field. ceived during the entire four-month campaign was 131.025 for the United States and England, which is tin all-time high for a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Walehloiter</span><span class="font1"> campaign. Of this grand total, G5,28G were received in the Brookly n office between May 1 and June 15, which means that in the last month of the campaign this year the Lord's ambassadors in both countries obtained more subscriptions than they did during the entire four-month campaign last year. G5.01G subscriptions were received in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Surely Jehovah, the Great Theo-crat, is with his people and richly blessing the efforts of those who seek to worship him in spirit and in truth. Every publisher of the Kingdom will readily agree that man alone could never accomplish such a work, but that Jehovah through Christ Jesus made it possible that his people who “willingly offered themselves” could perform this outstanding service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is very gratifying to note that the previous high of 129.G5S) for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Walehfouer</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions was reached in 1939. when the work still of 25c. Those who cannot afford to fake 1hat should be offered three booklets, on a contribution of 10c; and, if they’ cannot contribute 10c. then drop to one booklet, on any contribution they can make, or free, , if they cannot contribute but promise to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We shall continue using the phonograph, with a reioid of your choice--BY DOOBSTEt’ SETHI’S. Be</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sure to have a sufficient quantity of literature on hand for the month of August. Each publisher should place at least live books during this testimony period. From August 1 to 20, no orders will be shipped out from Ilie factory and no mail answered. 1’Iease refrain from wilting and oidering literature until after August 20. ITace your orders for supplies now, and this will give us time to ship them out before August 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, send in all new’ and renewal subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toirer</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Convolution,</span><span class="font1"> and your July’ field service report, so that these will be on hand for immediate attention. All the ambassadors of 'The Theocratic Government now’ look with joy and eagerness to the St. Louis Theocratic Assembly, and with a determination to do with their might what their hands find to do. This is the day of Jehovah, and ‘He has turned to His people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent’. —Zeph. 3 : 9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Advice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">In a good many states there are provisions for requiring erne who is violent and threatening others and attempting assault and injury, to make and post a bond called a “peace bond&quot; to assure the public that he will not breach the peace and assault those he has previously threatened had a free course in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Ear East, and continental Europe. This year there was no report from these countries, and yel the Theocratic publishers of the United Stales and England obtained nearly 2,909 more subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All servants of the Most High God will, by His grace, continue to advance and increase their Kingdom activity while the opportunity is yet ours. With the Theocratic Convention just ahead, each publisher should be greatly encouraged to go forward during July and August aiding new ones in Ilie field service with the hope of bettering the mark of 01,571 publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In cases where repeated arrests occur and after request tlie officials do not discontinue such arrests of publishers, we suggest tliat written notice lie served upon all the officials of the county and city government concerned, to the eifect that in event the statutes and ordinances under which Jehovah's w itnesses have been prosecuted are held unconstitutional by tlie higher courts, those arrested will bring damage suits against tlie officials to recover damages for such false arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also, in many states there are laws that provide that if the county’ and city officials are notified of threatened mob violence and are requested to afford protection and if after such request has been made to them in writing ami they refuse to protect, and one is injured, tlie person thus injured can collect damages in the amount suffered, uot to exceed a certain amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The brethren might, with local attorneys, check into what the law is in their respective states, and if there are any such laws the brethren can use them as above suggested, in the event there are threats of violence.</span></p>

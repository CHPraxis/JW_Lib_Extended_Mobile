<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“New Work” Should Be in Full Swing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Make It 350,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in One Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the St. Louis convention the reality and prominence of The Theocratic Government was continually kept before the minds of the Lord's people. Its supremacy, its privileges, its obligations and its ultimate victory were the theme of the corn ention throughout, from Brother Rutherford's opening remarks in his talk on &quot;Integrity”, Wednesday afternoon, to his almost closing statements Sunday evening when he said, ‘I want to ask you now to go back to your respective parts of the land and put on more steam. You work eight or ten hours behind a plow or you run a gas station or you feed the pigs or do something else; and when you go out in the service, don’t think you can quit after three or four hours and sit down and rest the balance of the time. 1’ut in all the time you can. We know hv’.v to speak the glad tidings of the Kingdom, and the Lord is going to keep the door open in America as long as He wants it open ; and when the work is done He is going to let the Devil stop it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was a “lightning-war” convention from the beginning to the end. In Brother Rutherford's opening speech, which was really the keynote speech of the convention, the absolute need of the Lord's people maintaining their integrity at any cost was clearly presented to all, and the vast audience grasped this point Immediately and responded enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Arranged It!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Almost a year ago the Lord through his organization made arrangements for the “Lightning-War Testimony Period” in October and informed his people of it through the Calendar. At the time we did not know why, but now we can appreciate the Lord’s purpose in arranging for this period in October. In the Devil's arrangement “lightningwar” is always destructive ; it brings misery and death to all who have anything to do with it. In Jehovah’s arrangement “lightning-war” is enlightening, comforting and life-giving to all creatures of good-will and destructive only to religion and to creatures and things that are unrighteous and wicked. This was very effectively demonstrated in Brother Rutherford’s speech on “Integrity”. Wednesday afternoon, and throughout the entire convention. Through him the Lord clearly revealed that Jehovah’s “lightning-war” will result in the destruction of the “Axls</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Powers” and all other totalitarian institutions opposed to God. but will be a source of comfort and blessing to all people of good-will, and that this very thing that is destructive to evil factors will itself be a blessing to those who love righteousness. Some pertinent points in this connection which were brought to our attention at the convention are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The entire speech on “Integrity” was a “lightning-war'’ against indifference, carelessness and negligence amongst those who have taken their stand on the Lord's side, and was enlightening, comforting and inspiring to those who are determined to faithfully serve the Lord at any cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Rutherford's Friday afternoon speech was similarly enlightening to the Lord's people, particularly his treatment of Isaiah 112:11) showing how pioneers and all the Lord's people now must “go through, go through the gates; prepare je the way of the people; cast nj&gt;, east up tin’ higliwa) ; gather out flip stones: lift up a standard for Ilie people&quot;. His elaboration on this text clearly revealed how the I.ord's people are to .joyfully participate in the fultiIhnent of this text now, and how that very fulfillment will result ultimately in the destruction of the enemy. Specifically referring to this, Brother Rutherford opened his remarks with, “Well, it should refresh everyone's heart to greet a company of real fighters that are not only willing to light but to tight for the greatest thing that has been known or ever<sup>-</sup> will be known, namely, the great Theocratic Government, and the weapons with which you tight are not carnal but they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds. 1 imagine as this company goes about the streets today they are making some of the ‘old woman' mighty sick. I mean that part of the ‘old woman' that wears flat hats.” This was enthusiastically received, and another point, when he referred to the enemy and said, “These unscrupulous things that walk on two legs try to induce the fanatics to go out and break up your cars, burn your literature and roll you and castrate some of you, which they have done. We serve notice upon such now, once and for all. that those who love the Almighty God and the Lord Jesus Christ and who have undertaken to serve Him are not deterred by any of the Devil's works that these enemies try to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A “Lightning Attack’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another “lightning altack” was in Saturday's talk on “Comfort All That Mourn” enlightening the Lord’s people on Daniel the 11th chapter, clearly revealing from the Scriptures who &quot;the king of the north&quot; and “the king of the south” are and the ulti mate end of totalitarianism, and the great privilege that belongs to the Lord’s people now to comfort all those who mourn because of the oppression by the Devil through these totalitarian organizations. These revelations from the Lord were a source of great comfort and inspiration to His people present, and inspired everyone to such an extent that when 500,000 copies of the lecture were released at the conclusion of the meeting and passed out free to all present, 10 copies to each publisher, w ith instructions to go out immediately and place them in the hands of the people, this commission was accepted and within a few hours they were all back again with practically all of their booklets disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sunday's “lightning-war” against the enemy and for the comfort and illumination of the Lord's people is indescribable in human language. The assembly of the children of the King, particularly the little ones gathered in The Arena, and Brother Rutherford’s speech on that subject, and which appears in the September 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> affected everyone present. Those of the anointed could clearly see themselves as the generation who are to declare the purpose and judgments of the Lord to another generation, those people of good-will and children of the King, and even the youngsters present could clearly see themselves referred to in the scripture where the Lord says that He was going to ‘perfect praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings'. Then, when Brother Rutherford put the question, those 15,000 children assembled unanimously responded stating they had fully consecrated themselves to the Lord and were determined to serve Him from that time forth. That was a declaration of war against the enemies of The Theocracy by these youngsters which will make itself felt from now until the end of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of this &quot;lightning-war” on the enemy was definitely pronounced. particularly when Brother Rutherford emphasized the fact from the Scriptures that the Lord would not permit the long-skirted religionists or anyone else to interfere with these youngsters' fulfilling their covenant with the Lord, and that if indifferent and negligent parents refuse to properly provide for the children those tilings of the Kingdom they should look to some other source for it. particularly to the prophet Daniel and his associates, whom we might expect “'most any day” and with whom they are to get in touch and receive instruction. The responsibility of the parents toward their children now in properly instructing them, taking the lead and directing them in the field service, was another bright</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hash in this “lightning-war” resulting beneficially to those who faithfully adhere to it, and destructively to those who are indifferent toward it. These are only a few of the many Hashes from the temple of the Lord in this great “lightning-war'’ that the Lord is now’ carrying on illuminating his people and foretelling the ultimate destruction of the enemy.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What a Witness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The response of the brethren at the convention was marvelous. Over ■16,000 were regularly in the field service putting on the greatest advertising campaign ever. They were found witnessing on the street corners, in the stores, house-to-house, in the streetcars, railway trains, buses; and every conceivable place where the public assemble there the representatives of The Theocracy were found publishing the Kingdom message, placing literature with the people and advertising Brother Rutherford's Saturday and Sunday speeches. And, in addition to these 46,000 field publishers, over 8,000 brethren served as cafeteria attendants, ushers, bookrooni attendants, service department attendants, trallic policemen, doctors, nurses, cashiers, checkers, trailer camp attendants, and in every conceivable way to make the convention a success to the glory of the Lord, all indicating the illuminating and energizing effect the &quot;lightning-war” had upon those in attendance, who were determined to maintain their integrity before the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore the convention was the beginning of the &quot;lightning - war” campaign; lor during ami immediately after it half a million copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort AU That Mourn</span><span class="font1"> were left in the hands of the people of St. Louis, and now we are privileged to carry forward this campaign with great er impetus and on a nation-wide scale from October 1. The keynote of this campaign was struck at the convention, and a terrific opening barrage fired into the ranks of the enemy there, but this campaign is not limited to the St. Louis area, by any means; it is nation-wide and world-wide as far as it is possible to get this message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the convention the Lord provided his people with new weapons for the conducting of this “lightning&quot; warfare—the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span><span class="font1"> These are the instruments to be used. Words are entirely inadequate to describe the power and effect of these two instruments for accomplishing the Lord's purpose. You who have read them can appreciate how true this is. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">•and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That .Mourn</span><span class="font1"> are uoing to have the same effect upon every person of good-will who reads them as they have had upon you. but in order for these people' of good-will to get the beneficial results from this literature it must be placed in their hands. That responsibility the Lord lays upon his witnesses : it cannot be side-stepped, and undoubtedly no one wishes to side-step it. It must be accepted joyfully. This is a very grave responsibility. The time is short. The work </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">| (Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>702 New Pioneers Signed at St. Louis</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah greatly manifested his favor toward his people at the Theocratic convention at St. Louis, Mo., August 6-10. In spite of everything the Devil and his agents could do to stop it, the Lord assembled over 115,000 people at this assembly; by far the greatest gathering of the Lord’s people ever held on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What are we doing to show that we appreciate the momentous events the Lord is now causing to come to pass? There are over 80,000 different individuals associated with the companies in this country, and over 50,000 more attending model studies. Can there be any legitimate reason advanced why we should not reach at least our 70,000 peak of publishers during the month of September, with potential publishers of almost twice that many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> draw from? If we do not reach our peak in September we shall have failed to reach it this year: September is the last month of the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It pleased Jehovah to clarify certain points bearing upon this consideration at the convention. The outstanding points were: that the primary issue is world domination by Jehovah as challenged by the Devil: the absolute requirement to maintain our integrity toward God; that Armageddon is very close; that all who will obtain the Lord's approval and protection must obtain it before /Vrinageddon. The only way</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Magazine Work” to Be Stressed in Sept.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Both Old and Young Should Share in Street Distribution</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Among the many outstanding facts about the Theocratic Assembly in St. Louis was that more than 45,000 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> magazines were placed with the people. The supply’ brought from Brooklyn was gone before the second day’ of the convention closed; thus showing the important part the magazines played during the five-day assembly. Thousands upon thousands of magazine publishers covered every street corner in St. Louis and near-by cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our September work according to the Calendar is “Magazine Work&quot;. Now is the time to thoroughly and regularly cover the local territory’ and fulfill the scripture at Proverbs 1: 20: “Wisdom . . . uttereth her voice in the streets.” This does not mean that yve will let all the other phases of the Kingdom activity drop during September and do just magazine work, but rather it means that the Lord's faithful servants will put forth increased effort and spend more time than ever before in the “Magazine Work” in addition to our regular door-to-door witnessing with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> (if you have your supply) and back-calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Children of all ages are encouraged to have a big part in the “Magazine Work&quot; as well as the older publishers. The more publishers on the streets at one time, the greater the curiosity and demand for the magazines. By consistently pushing the “Magazine Work” a uniform number of magazines can be placed, and, of course, increased as the this can be done is by faithfully obeying God's requirements. Faithfulness is demonstrated in obedience to the Lord's commission to his people now to publish this gospel of the Kingdom. In view of these facts, the large percentage of the 130,000 persons associated and attending model studies who are not participating in the service regularly should give very serious consideration to the words of the prophet Elijah to an undecided Israel, which words were: “How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lobd be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.” (1 Kings 18:21) We have arrived at a point where we must decide what we are going to do about our Kingdom responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">15,000 children at The Arena on Sunday morning, August 10, had no difficulty in deciding where they stand on this great issue. They unanimously declared that they had made a consecration to the Lord and were going to serve him from that time forth. These children will not be denied, and Brother Rutherford emphasized the fact that anyone who tries to stand in their way must answer to Jehovah; that He will not permit long-skirted religionists to turn them aside. The parents of these children have a great responsibility, much greater than they had prior to this convention. They must set a proper example for the street and route work advances. All companies should order a standard supply of each issue and place them all, rather than changing the amount every’ two or three weeks. Don’t forget the magazines in your door-to-door witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> articles, such as “The Wise”, “Integrity,” and “Children of the King”, should give every’ true servant of tlie Lord a burning desire to get this information into the hands of tlie “other sheep”. Remember the forthcoming articles on Daniel's prophecy, which Brother Rutherford told us would appear in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> These are of great interest to everyone at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The September 15 issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> will carry’ a convention report, and this should be placed in the hands of as many persons as possible—all those listed for back-calls, people who take the magazine on the streets, on the magazine routes, in store-to-store work, etc. The Theocratic Assembly at St. Louis was an event of vital importance. and information regarding it should therefore be placed in the hands of everyone possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beginning with the St. Louis convention. and following up with the “Magazine Work” during September, a marked increase should be noted in magazine placements, hours and publishers. Our goal should be 1,000,-000 magazines placed each month by magazine publishers. It means time and work and, by’ the Lord's grace. His people alone can perform it, as was demonstrated at the Theocratic convention. children. lead them into the field and help them to understand their privilege and their obligation to .Jehovah's Theocratic King. This decision must now be made before the Ix&gt;rd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let your September activity in the field service be your answer to this question; then continue faithfully thereafter to serve The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How about those 7,000 pioneers we were looking for? We are headed in that direction and it is still possible. Over 700 new pioneers enrolled at the convention. Many’ more were seriously considering the pioneer service during the convention and went home determined to make arrangements to that end. Undoubtedly a large percentage of these have reached their decision by now. If you have, send in immediately for your application and get enrolled and see if we can. by October 1. reach our goal of 7,000 pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many of tlie pioneers have children whom they are obligated to take into the field service with them and show them how they can properly serve the Lord and advance the Kingdom interests. Those children of pioneers who are not enrolled may turn in their reports to the company when they are working in conjunction with some local company’ organization. When pioneers are working in isolated territory the children’s report should be sent in on a regular publisher's report slip accompanying the pioneer's own report. These reports will be assembled and included in a miscellaneous report that will appear each month. In this way’ all those who are hailing the King, publishing the Kingdom message, will lie properly reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column .}) </span><span class="font1">Io be done is great, but the Lord's strength will be sufficient for those who put forth the effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It seems wise here to call to mind tlie fact that in the 33d chapter of Ezekiel the Lord emphasizes (lie fact that if the people are not warned and are taken away in their iniquity their blood will be required at the witnesses' hands. Therefore this great privilege must be accepted with diligence and sobriety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October is tlie beginning of the Society’s fiscal year, and in every respect the best month of the year for house-to-house witnessing whether you live in the city or in the country; weather conditions and roads and every other thing necessary to make witnessing ideal is at its best. There is no good reason why’ we should not have at least our peak of 70,000 publishers participating in the field work during the month of October. In fact, we have every’ reason to expect a great many’ more. Let each one prayerfully consider his obligation toward the Lord and start the fiscal year in October 3941 by wholeheartedly pushing this campaign to the glory of the Lord and the advancement of the Kingdom. By October everyone will have a thorough knowledge of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font1"> will have considered the Study Course, will understand how it applies, and will cooperate with the people of good-will in enabling them to understand and appreciate these great truths that are now coming to them. The book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font1"> will be placed with the people on a contribution of 25c. If for any reason this combination cannot be placed, drop to a three-book-let combination on a 10c contribu-</span></p>

It will bring vividly to their attention ‘victories won in their defense' in the courts of the land, and they will greatly benefit by this. In brief, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Aews No.</span><span class="font1"> 9 opens in stirring language which will clearly’ show to people who desire to see righteousness prevail that victories gained by this country do not always come as a result of a bloody war, but in the courts of the land in defense of the principles on which tlie Constitution is based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 9 may be had at the regular rate of 50c a thousand. If you have any </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 8 left, put them out now. Pioneers may have 1000 copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 9 free with each order of literature sent to the Society. Pioneers should not order </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> alone, but should include them with orders for other material. The Society bears the expense of printing and providing these for the pioneers to enable them to give a very thorough witness in the territory assigned to them. Where a group of pioneers are working together they may send in a joint order for their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Aews;</span><span class="font1"> also, they should order literature jointly, so that we shall be able to make hundred-pound shipments to them and thus keep expenses at the very minimum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The Society has been able to com-jilete about 500 of the new model phonograph, and these have all been disposed of. Due to the ‘national defense' priorities we are hindered by delays and difficulties in procuring certain necessary parts, and it may be several weeks more before more machines are completed. How-evei-, as soon as more are finished they will be shipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Orders are being accepted by the Society only if accompanied by the full remittance. None will be charged to the accounts. The cost of the phonograph is 812.00. In the case of the pioneers the Society will absorb 84.00 ol this cost; hence pioneers need remit only 88.00 with their orders for their own personal phonograph. If pioneers order phonographs for others who are not pioneers they must remit the full 812.00. Orders will be filled according to the date received at this office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Let us make this campaign exery-thing that its name implies, &quot;Light-xing-Wab.” “Lightning'’ carries the thought of light, speed, comfort and fearlessness. Let these thoughts impel us to a very intensive campaign to the glory ot the Lord during tlie month of October. Let us make a lightning distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children. </span><span class="font1">We should have at least 350.090 bound books placed in the homes of the people, and a like number of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course sent out, by’ the end of this campaign.

None of the material in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Childien</span><span class="font1"> Study Course will ever be exhibited by the publishers at any time while going from door to door. To demonstrate the question folders while going from house to house placing the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> would destroy the entire effect of the Study Course; and that is why these are never given to the publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of “Order Slip”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every time a publisher places a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book he will make every effort to secure the name and address of the person receiving the same, to be written plainly on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slip. It does not seem to be advisable to tell the people you intend to mail them a study course, as many will fear they will in some way be obligated financially; and this we wish to avoid. Rather explain to them the keen desire on your part to call back on them in three or four weeks, after they have had time to read the book, and discuss any questions they may have at that time. If they do not wish to disclose their names voluntarily, take a mental note of the house number and street and casually state, &quot;It has been a real pleasure to talk to you about the Bible and the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font1"> I know this will bring much comfort to you. My name is _____________ I am very glad</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to have made your acquaintance. What is your name?&quot; If you fail to get the name this way, perhaps you will be able to learn it from a neighbor- when you call there, or, as a last resort, write the word “Householder” instead of the name and fill in the address on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slip after you leave the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the end of each day each company publisher is to turn in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slips with his Publisher's field Service Report slip, so (hat the back-call servant may address the envelopes for the mailing of the question folder's each week. If the publisher' regularly works Ilie same territory and desires to personally deliver the folders each week, thus saving on postage, he should write at the bottom of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slip the words “Personal Delivery&quot;, before turning it in. This will denote that he will deliver the course personally each week instead of mailing. If no notation tippears the course will be mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Call Servant's Responsibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slips will be turned over to the back-call servant as they are received from the publishers. It will be his duly to see that the proper Studies of the Course tire sent to these new readers of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> at the right time. Epon receiving a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slit) the back-call servant will have the address copied plainly and neatly on three envelopes, and in the upper right-hand corner, where the stamp will be placed, number them 1, 2, and 3, which refers to the part (folder) of the Course to be inserted. If it will be a personal delivery, then also write the name of the publisher. lightly, with a pencil, in the same upper right-hand corner of each envelope. Into each of these envelopes will be inserted the proper Study folder of the Course, making sure these are properly folded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A return address, probably the local company Kingdom Hall address, must be filled in on the reverse side of the envelope. Please note that you will till in only the street address and city and state. Do not write in anything else. (Large companies that do considerable mailing can have a rubber stamp made of an address that will lit these lines neat lx.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After doing this, the back-call servant will tile the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slips in a place separate from his regular back-call tile, under the name of the individual publisher, for future reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Arranging the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Study Course Question Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The three question folders in the Study Course are printed on both sides'. When you receive your folders from the Society, all the forms should be folded the same way, with the sixm.r. color on each folder on the outside. This must be done without fail, in order that the recipient of the Study Course will begin each Study on the first page of the folder. On the first Study folder of the Course the outside is printed in blue: on the second, In purple; on the third, in red. These folders are not numbered, bill if you are alert you will make no mistakes when putting the Study folders in the envelopes for mailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The back-call servant and those assisting him should be thoroughly acquainted with these folders, knowing which is the first, the second, and the third; and this can easily be ascertained, because the first Study folder covers Hie first four chapters of the book. The second Study starls out by stating, “So you have enjoyed Chapters 5 to S of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.&quot;</span><span class="font1"> The third one is conclusive. because it says, &quot;Now that you have finished reading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children . . . &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">There is no reason to get these mixed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Arranged for Mailing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sunday mailing dates should be printed on marker tabs, and these marker tabs be arranged in weekly date order. Your envelopes having been addressed, you will insert the first Study folder in the addressed envelope you have marked “1”, seal it, and file this in front of your date marker for the next Sunday; your second Study folder, place in the envelope marked “2&quot;, seal it, and file in front of the next week’s date marker; and the third one, tile in front of the third week's date marker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Eon example : If during the first week in September (1st to 5th) the back-call servant receives 100 Study Course Order slips, then these should be properly handled, addressing the envelopes and preparing for mailing. The first Study folders would all be filed in front of the date marker for Sunday, September 7, and would be mailed September 7. The second Study folder would be filed in front of a marker dated September 14: the third Study folder would be filed in front of a marker for September 21. The above takes care of the Study Course orders for everything turned in up to Friday, September 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers working in the field from Saturday, September G, to Friday, September 12, will be turning in daily their Publisher’s Field Service Report slips and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slips. If this same company received during this week, from Saturday to Friday inclusive, another 100 orders for the Study Course, then the first Study folder for this second hundred will be tiled in front of the September 14 date marker; the second Study folder for these new readers, in front of September 21; and the third Study folder, in front of September 28 (a new dale marker).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Sunday the 14th comes around, then the back-call servant will be mailing the second folder to some readers and the first folder to other readers. Then the next week, September 21, after having added (in the same manner as described above) the Study Courses for the new readers, he will mail out on that date some of the third, some of the second, and some of the first Studies of the Course, and from then on under these various markers there will be filed and mailed the first, second, and third Studies in the Course, according to date the books were placed in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each Sunday, before mailing the Study folders, lie postage should be attached to each of these envelopes except those that are going to be delivered personally, and on these latter appear Ilie names of the publishers who will make the deliveries. By having the name written lightly in the upper right-hand corner of each envelope, when you come to Ilie lime for delivery you can very easily find the publisher and turn it over to him. Publishers coming to the back-call servant’s files Friday, Saturday or Sunday prior to the time of delivery may be given the envelopes at that time for personal deliveries. Those publishers finding it more convenient to make personal deliveries in their own territory on Sunday, rather than on Monday (when the Studies mailed will reach the readers), may do so. putting them under the doors securely. and not in the mail boxes. The only envelopes that may be put in mail boxes are those with postage on them. Before personal delivery is made, however, the publisher should erase his name from the upper right-hand corner (which had been written there with a soft lead pencil).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Delivery</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers assuming the responsibility of making personal delivery of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course should make arrangements so that their deliveries are regular, that is, once every week and on the same day, preferably Sunday or Monday, never varying more than one day earlier or one day later. If they cannot do Iliis, the course should be mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In companies where group witnessing has been arranged it may be that the children in the company wish to handle the delivery of the Study Course every week. Children should be encouraged to take up this work under the direction of the company servant. These deliveries can be made every Monday after school. Many of the children may have bicycles, which will aid in speeding up delivery and make it possible to cover a greater territory. Children living in territory that has just been worked by group witnessing should he given the privilege of making deliveries in that area. Barents having their own individual territory assignments near by, and working them regularly, should have their own children make deliveries for them, thus saving on postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will not be necessary to ring the doorbell when making these deliveries of envelopes containing the Study Course, but just slip them' under the door. Time spent in delivering the Study Course may be reported as time in the field service, by all publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Children” Back-Call Reminder</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This form should be filled out at the same time that all the envelopes are addressed, and the name of the publisher should be written on this slip and notation made of the week in which the first back-call is to be made, which will be one week after the mailing date of the third Study in the Course. All weeks begin with Sunday. Getting back to our example :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the first Study folder is mailed on September 7, the second folder on the 14th, and the third folder on the 21st. then the first back-call should be made during the week of September 28, which is a Sunday. In other words, if it is convenient to the publisher he may make the hack-call on that Sunday, the 28th, or any time during that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Back-Call Reminder slips made out for each Study Course Order should be filed with the third Study of the Course, to be mailed the third week. When the third Study folders go into ihe mail, then the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Back-Call Reminder slips for those Courses should he distributed to ihe various publishers, and this will give the publishers one week’s notice of the back-calls they are to make the week starting with the following Sunday. The instructions on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">Back-Call Reminder slip should he followed carefully by the publisher making the back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the reader of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> receives the third and final Study of the Course he will see that it concludes with these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Having enjoyed this home educational course, you might like to personally talk over many other questions with that publisher of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font1"> You may! Next week a publisher will call. Receive such one. It will mean further enlightenment and benefit to you and those you love. It is part of a home educational campaign in the interest of 'men of good-will'. Learn the truth and live.”</span></p>

The release of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> at the St. Louis convention was an event that will never be forgotten by those who were privileged to witness it. The new work (or rather, as Brother Rutherford put it, “it is not exactly a new work, it is just putting on a little more steam for the final roundup'’) began that evening when Brother Rutherford said: “But I am glad to tell you that, while that 40,000 [autographed edition] are gone, there is another 130,000 copies on the grounds ready for use. So you will have 130,000 on the grounds to start with now.” We are heading into the final roundup now, and each and every one should get into this as soon as he possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the convention 150,000 of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and 500,000 of the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn </span><span class="font1">were grabbed up by the brethren almost before one had a chance to turn around, so that when Brother' Rutherford in his speech that evening declared over the microphone, “We begin this work right now,” the vast audience gave its enthusiastic assent. They had their equipment and were ready to begin, and did begin, from that time forth. Actually the campaign began there. The 150.000 of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">and half a million </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font1"> that were taken by the con-ventioners were just a foretaste to tide you over until you got back home and received your consignment.

<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course Order slips which have been placed in the file under the name of the publisher will be checked once each month against the Back-Call Follow-Up Reports turned in, to make sure that all have been called on. If they have been called on and interest shown, then a regular Permanent Back-Call Record will be made out and placed in the regular back-call file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The possibilities of this new work are vast, and we do well to take advantage of our every opportunity. There is no doubt that this is a provision by Jehovah to help us discharge our responsibilities toward the people of good - will. No one should be satisfied with less than 12 back-calls a month now.</span></p>

No consignments are being made to pioneers. Therefore pioneers should place their orders immediately for a good, substantial quantity. When your initial supply-runs low, order more. Remember, the first edition of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> is three million copies. These should be placed within the twelve months, or % million copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> placed every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is a big task, but we are reminded of remarks heard at the convention. The brethren serving at the convention worked so hard and enthusiastically in supplying the spiritual and temporal needs of those in attendance that the businessmen of St. Louis who had occasion to come to The Arena and the Arena grounds could not help but marvel at the whole thing. It was beyond their comprehension that such a vast assembly could be handled so orderly and easily. If we put the same zeal and devotion and hard work into the campaign for the distribution of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font1"> then they will have something to really be amazed at; and we are confident that each and every one attending the convention will carry the spirit of that convention with him and when back home push the campaign with the same zeal and joy that he had during the convention, and if that is done a quarter million books each month can and will be very easily reached, by the Lord's grace and strength. Every company publisher should be encouraged to have a part in this campaign and commence immediately.</span></p>

As with company publishers, likewise it is entirely out of order for the pioneers to exhibit the Study Course in their door-to-door witness work. Pioneers in company territory, of course, will continue to co-operate with the company and turn in a Permanent Back-Call Report slip and their regular Back-Call Follow-Up Report slip after each back-call where real interest is manifested, bring the interested to the study meetings, and aid in every way to strengthen the companies and help their brethren.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Every Theocratic ambassador should be equipped with a copy of the autographed edition of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and properly prepare himself for the witness work by becoming thoroughly familiar with its contents. Brother Rutherford’s letter “To the Children of the King” is a marvelous encouragement and admonition to us all. You want to read it and carefully consider this message often.

Many of the people of goodwill will undoubtedly prefer the autographed edition If they know it is available. Tell them we have a supply.

The people of good-will throughout the territory will want to assemble and study and discuss the contents of this book as soon as they start reading it. It has such a tremendous appeal to every normal person of good-will that they are going to live the experiences of John and Eunice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By October 1 every book study should be using </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> exclusively, and as many additional book studies as are necessary to provide for the new interest should be organized. Each company servant, zone servant and pioneer should have in mind the establishment of new book studies throughout his territory and look diligently to that end. Organize </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> studies in every community if possible, even if one publisher has to take three or four studies. The time is here for everyone to do some real work in assisting the people of good-will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Many of the brethren will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">able </span><span class="font1">and will want to pay the postage for the Study Courses sent to the persons with whom they place the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font1"> and for others. So that these brethren may have a share in carrying a part of this burden, each company should arrange for a contribution box to be placed in each Kingdom Hall, marked especially for this purpose. This contribution box can be marked “Contributions for Postage on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course”. Money received in this box will be handled by the treasurer, and be credited to the “Postage” account of the company. At the end of the month, if these contributions are sufficient to pay for all postage, then the company, of course, would not ask the Society for credit, because the brethren in the company were privileged to bear this much of the burden.

<p><span class="font1">In order that all regular publishers may become acquainted with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course, it is suggested that during the month of September three studies be held, one on each Study Course folder. This is not so much a study of the book as it is a study of the Study Course. These studies should be attended by everyone in the company. This is a provision by the Lord to assist all to properly serve in this new work that is opening up. Everyone needs a thorough understanding of how it is going to be carried on ; therefore they should take advantage of this provision and attend the studies regularly. The study of each folder should not last longer than one hour. Those attending the study are not to be given a copy of the study course. The company servant will see that the study conductor only is given one copy of each of the Study Course folders for this purpose. It is presumed that all attending the study have read the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font1">book at least once. Those who have not done this should complete their study of the book immediately. During the week preceding the study each one should read the four chapters to be covered that week before coming to the meeting. Have the details fresh in mind. Only by so doing can you take an active part in the study and intelligently discuss the points presented in the Study Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After this special series of studies is completed, then start at the beginning of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> book and study it in the usual manner in your various book studies. Prepare now your study organization and bring the people of good-will, especially those who obtained copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> from those in the field service, to these studies. In no other way will they get the full benefit of the provision the Lord is making for their aid by means of the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">buttons by others, we believe, the burden of the postage which the Society undertakes to pay will not be too great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It can easily be seen that the brethren handling the arranging, mailing and delivery of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course must all work at unity and there must be full cooperation, with the interests of The Theocracy put first, ahead of everything else. Every publisher must do his share. The proper handling of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> Study Course will, we feel sure, bring about a great increase in your local organization, a rich blessing upon all faithful servants of The Theockvcy, and praise to the name of the Most High God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This new publication released at the Theocratic Assembly was received with deep appreciation by all present there. It contains valuable information which will aid greatly in the defense of Jehovah’s witnesses in their witness work, such as rulings of the highest courts of the United States in support of faithful witnesses and in defense of their rights and liberties in His service. Copies of this booklet may be had at five cents each. A covering remittance must accompany every order; otherwise it will be ignored. These will not be charged to accounts.</span></p>

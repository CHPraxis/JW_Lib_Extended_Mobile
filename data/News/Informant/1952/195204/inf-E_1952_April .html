</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A Magazine Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Liberty is a precious and rare possession today. In this old world there are millions of persons in mental bondage. To be released from this captivity they must hear and act on the Kingdom proclamation that Jehovah is now having sounded. Do your part, Kingdom publishers, by making use of every opportunity to proclaim liberty in all the land just as the jubilee trumpet was used many years ago.—Lev. 25: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During April splendid opportunities to sharply increase the proclamation of liberty are open. It is Memorial time and also the final month to reach our quota of new subscriptions. At Memorial time many new ones will associate with us and we should invite them to go along with us in the service and show them our enthusiasm for presenting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> from house to house, on back-calls, street work, etc. Start them on the road that leads to maturity by training them in all features of service and by encouraging them to attend all company meetings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> How may we present the magazines? Magazine Day offers three avenues: at the homes, in the stores and on the streets. Has your company arranged for house-to-house and store-to-store Magazine Day activity? Are you taking part in it? Many publishers report 30 to 40 magazines placed in two hours of this service, and with fine results. Try it and see what a joyful service it actually is. When in street magazine work, approach people and offer the latest magazine. Do not stand motionless. Plan street magazine work for the day and time when the streets are the busiest, and display only the current issue of the magazine. Use only the latest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> in your presentation at the doors and stores.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> at every opportunity. If the householder does not subscribe, then one might offer two different copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">for 10c. This will demonstrate the magazine’s wide variety of contents. Try to leave a magazine in every home. Wherever you place the magazines, be sure to follow up placements with the latest issue, calling regularly on those who will take the magazines but who do not subscribe. Make your activity count by being busy and regular in definite territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> During this final month of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign we should call back on all those who promised to take the subscription. Encourage those with whom we placed individual copies of the magazines to subscribe. Make every effort to obtain new subscriptions during this last month of the campaign. Remember, this is the final opportunity to reach our individual quota. In the United States we obtained 125,180 new subscriptions during January and February. That is 17,406 more than last year for the same months. What will we do during the final month of the campaign? The answer will depend to a great extent upon you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> So, then, our God-given work this month is to get the magazines into the hands of the people and aid them to know their contents. These instruments will accomplish a great work if they are properly presented and widely distributed. April can be made an outstanding month in magazine distribution through our energetic efforts. Let us as one body use our voices to present them, and surely this will result in a chorus that will be heard as effectively as the sound from the jubilee trumpet.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The New Cost List</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">With this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> each company is being sent two copies of the new Cost List. One for the company servant and one for the stock servant. The company should keep their cost lists up to date. This may be done by listing the new publications announced in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> under “Publications Now Available’’ and make necessary changes in rates ac-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Just what we needed,” wrote one company. “Unitedly we will support and carry out the suggestions so that Kingdom activity is properly cared for,” writes another. Many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Need for More House-to-House Work</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Sometimes in arranging our activity in the Lord’s service, there may be a tendency to let some features of our ministerial activity take most of our service time, thus allowing other features to lose their proper place of importance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> In recent years house-to-house work has not been receiving the attention that its importance in the theocratic organization demands. This condition exists in many companies and corrective steps should now be taken by the local organizations to remedy it. In the United States, we have placed much literature during these years; but notice this trend: In 1935, an average of 3 books per publisher were placed each month; in 1945, 2 books; In 1948, 1 book; and in 1950 and 1951, 1 book every two months. It is in the house-to-house work that we can best place these Bible study aids that are so vital in helping persons of good will get a knowledge of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The foregoing presents food for thought. Our publishers are increasing and our placements are diminishing. With this information in mind the Society has counseled pioneers to spend approximately 50 per cent of their time devoted to field service in house-to-house work. This proportion compares well with the Importance of house-to-house work and seems to be an appropriate division of time for all publishers. Additionally, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> recently suggested that all publishers try to put in at least two hours in the door-to-door work on Sundays.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> No one should let the comparative simplicity or convenience of other features of service keep him from regularly engaging in house-to-house work, for it is here that most of the “other sheep” are contacted initially. At the doors we are in a good position to advantageously witness to persons in our territory, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Placing “Watchtower” Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we would be pleasing to .Jehovah, share in the vindication of his name and gain eternal life we must be governed by the “law of the mind” and not by the “law of the flesh”. One of the ways in whkh some of Jehovah’s servants succumb to the “law of the flesh” is by following the lines of least resistance, or by getting into a rut in connection with their Held service. How so, you ask?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many publishers begin taking part in the service by engaging m the street work, and ever after that remains their favorite form of service Thus it is that many more publishers offer the magazines on the streets than from door to door and fioni store to store. Yet, should it not be just the other way around? For far more magazines can be placed by calling at homes and business places than can be placed on the street corners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This fact is emphasized in the report from Colombia. There house-to-house and store-to-store magazine work has increased magazine placements two hundred per cent. (112)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And the report from Venezuela tells of a circuit servant’s placing 62 magazines in just a short time going from house to house. How long would it have taken him, have taken you. for that matter, to place 62 magazines on the street? (243)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And do we call back on magazine placements? A missionary in Teru told how repeated calls on a shoemaker and his son during a period of six months (originally only a magazine placement) resulted in all of the family becoming interested, one of whom already is a publisher and has given his first student talk. (204)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theocratic Tactfulness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mature ministers of Jehovah appreciate that more is needed than knowledge and zeal if they would he effective. They must be all things to men of all kinds. Manv sincere persons have been so blinded by their clergy that they are very bitter toward the truth. Especially if we would help these prisoners to gam their freedom we must say “Go forth” tactfully. —Matt. 10:16; 1 Cor. 9:22. NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 1952 “Yearbook” tells of an Argentine minister making good use of tact. A bitter opposer was tactfully brought around to see the Scriptural-ness and reasonableness of the truth before it was identified to him as being of the Watchtower or Jehovah’s witnesses. This one-time opposer is now a publisher. (79)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another example comes from France. There a publisher, who was making a call on a lady who had obtained a book, was greeted by her husband with, “People like you ought to be hanged,” etc. By tactfully calming down the irate husband and setting before him the new world hope, a back-call was arranged. Today he and his wife are among the most zealous publishers in the company. (137)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Jamaica a publisher overheard a lady saying: “I’ll run any Jehovah’s witness away—those liars.” The publisher then called on her, greeting her pleasantly, and the woman responded with a queer look and a rough answer. The publisher introduced herself as a dear friend loving the woman as much as herself. It turned out that this woman was one of good will, sighing and crying because of the injustices she experienced. She is now enjoying her weekly Bible studies. (163) Yes, the wisdom from above and unselfish interest far exceed anything the world has to offer in the way of psychology.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>To Magazine Obtainers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As ministers we are sincerely interested in, anil are obligated to assist, the persons of good will vith whom we place magazines. Therefore. we will build up their interest and call back on these people with a view to starting studies. The wise servant will skillfully apply tact when approaching the householder, be conversational and direct his witness to specific points of interest. We must be positive in our altitude: always friendly but not familiar, and strive to meet each person on a common ground. To be enthusiastic about our work, we must know the contents.of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first thing to do when we approach a magazine obtainer is to greet him warmly and identify ourselves and the work in which we are engaged. This might be as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘■Hello, my name is .... I represent the Watchtower Society in a free Bible educational work. On my previous visit 1 left a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'rhe Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> which dealt with many things of interest, such as the article ‘No Division in the Mosaic Law’. I would be interested in your observation^ on that article which we discussed briefly.” A discussion along these lines will quicken the interest and may result in a home Bible study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Before leaving, briefly cover tiie next issue which you would like to have them take for study. You might say, “Do you know that each copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> treats a different Scriptural subject? The latest issue I have here highlights the theme of 'choosing between life and death'. Also, I'm sure you will be glad to know that a year's subscription for this magazine is available to you for a contribution of only $1.” It the individual does not</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Need for More . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’il) </span><span class="font4">locate righteously disposed ones and then assist them further by calling back and conducting Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The situation is clear: many who have become associated with us, particularly in the past several years, need personal assistance in door-to-door activity and in following up the interest found. They need to become mature. They must learn to talk and to express themselves in the presence of others. This can best be done by witnessing from door to door. That will aid them in subscribe, then offer single copies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The same principles can be applied when making back-calls using the expiration slips. The minister will find it relatively simple and easy to make this type of call. You have the name of the individual you want to contact. Therefore, ask for the name that appears on the expiration slip. When you have contacted the person, you might say. &quot;I am a representative of the Watchtower. I am very glad to find you at home this evening and to be able to talk to you for a few moments. Undoubtedly you have received much comfort and peace of mind during the past year in reading the magazine which has been coming to your home. I'm sure you realize the value of this most edifying magazine, especially in these days of distress and turmoil. I have been notified by the Watchtower Society that your personal subscription has expired. Appreciating the value of this magazine, and the comfort and hope it offers, I’m sure you would like to have it come to your home again, and I will be more than pleased to help you renew your subscription. You may do so by contributing .$1 for a year's subscription.'’ Then make sure to call back to further develop the interest, as well as bring them magazines during the period of waiting for mail delivery. It the particular party is not home, witness to the person who comes to the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The approach and presentation should be simply phrased and easy to understand so that the person upon whom we are calling and anyone working along with us while training will be readily able to grasp and follow along with what we are saying. This will help new publishers to mature more readily and share in the back-call work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">becoming mature. Too often publishers, feeling that they lack ability to express themselves, engage only in street magazine work or handbill distribution. These publishers should be assisted to maturity by being given personal instructions in actual door-to-door and follow-up work so they will know how to talk the truth. This will be a very great ail-vantage to them when the time comes to participate in the unassigned territory work during June, July, and August. Preaching is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">April will bring a new peak of publishers if each one of us is active and does his part to assist those needing attention. What can we do? The following demonstrations will assist each publisher to see and fulfill his part. Wherever possible, the first demonstration should be put on at the first service meeting during April. The other may be put on whenever it fits into the service meeting program.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Scene I: (3 minutes) The early Christian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conductor calls attention to i\Io-rnorial, then introduces a scene of a group of brotheis of the early Christian congregation They are talking about Memorial, and saving how God has now turned to the Genl lies to take out a people for his name. They discuss how the Memorial celebration shows Jehovah is instituting a now system of things, far better than the old Jewish system: how wonderful it is that God is making it world-wide association of brothers, bound in a marvelous unity! (1 P»-t 5:9, bh-h. 4:1-6: “Watchtower.” Jan. J, 1952, pages 10, 11) God's pm pose is to build up the congregation to full maturity (Eph. 4:12, 13) Then their attention turns to their individual responsibility as part of that association to Lend every effort to holt) all in their local congregation to reach full strength of maturity, and the means they are using to help certain brothers. Some recall that they saw Jesus doing this very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Scene II: (12 minutes) The Christian congregation today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the use of pages 11, 12. paragraphs 28, 29. ‘Watchtower,” January 1, 1952, the conductor introduces the modern-day scene. A service meeting is in session on the platform. (Very small companies may have audience participation, with comment* rs prepared in advance ) A brother is talking on the maturity of the Chiis-tian congregation today. He emphasizes that the world association has grown to include 602,141 who do not partake of the emblems, but by their attendance sav they willingly stand on the side, of Jehovah’s supi&lt;?macy and want to come under the theociatic system of things. To stay there they must reach maturity Then ho asks questions (an.sweis prepared beforehand): “What do we in effect say when we attend Memorial, or partake?” “What is the antitypual feast of unleavened bread, and are we observing it? How?” “What is maturity?” “Who feels he Licks maturity in connection with certain features of field service?” (Here brothers and sifters may make comments as though they need help in certain kinds of field work.) “Exactly what can we do to help these brothers?” Concrete examples can be given. Each one can be urged to get his newly interested person of good will who attended Memorial into the service Assistant e to those not having part in the “Watchtower” campaign's final month may be stressed. (“Watchtower,” Mar i, 1946; Jan. 15 and Nov. 15, 1951: Jan. 1 and 15, 1952. will turnish material.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conductor may conclude with exhortation to apply these things and aid everyone this Memorial month and throughout 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Need for More . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'il) </span><span class="font4">thing that will be required then at every home. The brothers should know how to present the message coherently, ami it is the privilege of mature ones to train others now.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> It is encouraging to note the increase in the number of publishers in our yearly reports, isn’t it? How</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Scene I: Aid all to be regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 1 (3 minutes) ('ompanv book study conductor is talking to two or three* mature publishers and enlisting their assistance in harmony with the Society’s letter dated February 20, 1952, points of which he uses to outline the need for assisting others. Goal for studv group is 100 per cent reporting during the month. Conductor gi\es each one some names of publishers to be helped in the service and suggests that they arrange to do door-to-door work with them, since it offers a real opportunity to tram new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2 (3 minutes)</span><span class="font3"> Study cmiduc (or calls on Brother “New” who is assigned to his study group and has not published for some time. “New” is tactfully invited to join him Sunday morning Yes, “New” replies, he knows that he should have a regular part in the Lewd’s work and often wishes he could, but just does not feel confident enough to do so. As it is, he can only go along with another publisher and feels that he really does not have a part in helping other people. Conductor points out that training is needed as shown by Jesus in instructing his disciples. Paul at Acts 20:2&lt;i, etc., and that he would be glad to assist “New” by training him for field work As part of the training, conductor instructs “New” how he can take part by offering the booklets and giving a brief witness with them after conductor is through making the “Watchtower” presentation to householder. Artangements are made for Sunday morning service together</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Scene II: In the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 1 &nbsp;(8 minutes) Alter wit</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">nessing at a few doors and making complete* offer, conductor asks “New” if he is ready to olfer booklets at next door after conductor makes initial presentation. “New” says he’s ready to try, so both proceed to the next door. Conductor makes presentation, then “New” offers booklets and succeeds in placing them. Interest is noted on record sheet for later back-call \ft»r a couple of doors, “New” says ho thinks he can make the offer himself and would like to try it. Conductor assures him that he may do so and asks whether he should go with him to the door or let him go entirely alone. “New” decides to go alone and returns from call very happy “He did it,&quot; yes, he made the call all by himself and found the right words to speak. They discuss call just made and then conductor tactfully arranges lor them to go out together again, realizing that more than one period of training is needed by “New” before he will be capable of going entirely on his own and in position to assist others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">much more effective would our witnessing work be if we were maintaining the 1935-45 level in placement of books? By everyone's taking this matter seriously and applying more of his Held service time in the house-to-house work, we feel sure this feature of service will again regain its proper place in our service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Letter . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Conf'd&gt; </span><span class="font4">similar letters have been received by the Society from publishers and companies expressing appreciation for the personal letter to each publisher dated February 20, 1952. How gratifying it is to know that all Kingdom publishers rejoice in receiving instructions and are unitedly determined to do their part in carrying out the suggestions outlined in that letter! When we do the Lord's work as he directs, it cannot fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Has your company reached its quota of publishers as yet? The excellent points in this letter which were discussed at the service meetings will help individual publishers as well as companies to expand their sen ice of praise. Lach company publisher, pioneer, and servant should do his part to personally follow through on this letter. Proper application of the points emphasized will be the means of gaining, not only maturity for each and every one associated with your company, but also a new peak in publishers. The work outlined therein will permit all to see and feel the welcome expressed by the local company in offering assistance to each one wanting to serve the Lord. More prisoners will be released as we progress to maturity, our goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The potential is there. The company records have the names. Now let's do what the letter suggests and outlines to help all those associated. The company servant and assistant company servant will make sure that those who have not been out in service during the previous month or by the 15th of the current month are looked after and that these are being assisted by the study conductors. These in turn should enlist the aid of mature publishers and pioneers, and all. working together as an organized group, will render the necessary assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Give them this encouraging and confidence-giving help to get out in the door-to-door magazine work, the street work, yes, in all forms of service. Then help them to keep on in the work of progressing to maturity, making sure that they continue to have the needed encouragement of other publishers through personal contacts, group contacts for service, by picking them up for meetings and by other like provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Servants and publishers, keep in mind that where organized arrangements are followed through and each one does his part as the letter suggests, not only will we set </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">new peak during April, but also in the following months, and by keeping on doing this Jehovah is sure to add his blessings.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Public Speaker</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The public speaker has a wonderful opportunity to make available io hundreds of truth-hungry persons of good will that rich, delightfully prepared portion of God's Word which is now placed on the table of Jehovah. As a representative of the Society he must be fully qualified to be accorded this privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">- To qualify as a public speaker, a brother must be mature and have the ability to present the truth properly, and be at least 18 years of age. He should he dedicated to Jehovah and immersed, having been actively engaged in field service for at least one year after his immersion. Novices may not be used. (1 Tim. 3:2-7, ATT) The company servant and school servant have the responsibility to select qualified speakers. The selection and regular use of a brother as a public speaker will be based, not only on his ability to speak, but also on his regular field service activity and enrollment and attendance at the theocratic ministry school as well as other meetings, thus setting the proper example. The same qualifications are required of speakers giving public-talks at the company book studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The responsibility of the public-speaker is to see that his talk is thoroughly prepared and convincingly delivered. To do this, his material will need to he well thought out, and unproved assertions eliminated. He should adhere closely to the Society’s outline and time schedule, and draw chiefly upon the latest in-</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Parole Notice</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Federal Parole Board has granted Society’s counsel, H. C. Covington, permission to apply for parole in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses imprisoned for Selective Service violations. Application will be made in behalf of the brothers who have served one-third or more of their sentence and who have not yet received parole. A large number of brothers have been denied parole. Anyone knowing some brother who has been incarcerated longer than one-third of his term and who has been denied parole should write to Brother Covington immediately and provide specific facts so that proper information can be submitted to the parole board in Washington for consideration. In writing about this matter include the following information : name of inmate, name of institution, date incarcerated, length of sentence and address of family or nearest relatives. Send this information in as soon as possible for each brother so imprisoned.</span></p>

He will avoid using repetitious and out-of-date matter, also too </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">many</span><span class="font4"> quotations of old world philosophy and wisdom. Rather, he will use a constructive approach, using good Scriptural proof and sound logic, which should be clearly and coherently expressed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> When companies need and desire speakers from neighboring companies, they should make arrangements through (he company servant and not with individual speakers. Those assigned to give a talk will set a proper, more inspiring example and give a better talk if they prepare in advance and go out into the field service with the company in the morning prior to the talk. Also, those who may have to travel some distance to give a talk should, as far as possible, arrange to travel and arrive the evening before. In this way the speaker will be able to engage in morning field service with the company the following day. When making assignments of servants to give talks in outside companies, company servants should be conscious of the obligations servants have in the local company organization. In the majority of cases, perhaps one assignment per month will suffice.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> By thorough preparation of material and proper delivery, the public speaker can indeed enlighten many persons to the grand purposes of Jehovah God as contained in his Word.</span></p></li></ul>

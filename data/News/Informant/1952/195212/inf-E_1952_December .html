<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">December Splendid for Three Bound Books</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Have You Placed One Set Yet?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah requires clean worship on the part of his people. Through his King Christ Jesus he has established clean worship in the earth, and the lips of his devoted servants have been cleansed to now sing forth his praises. The result has been the abandonment of the corrupt old world and its false, unclean worship by many thousands of good-will persons. They now join their voices in songs of praise and increasingly appreciate the need for clean worship. Many more thousands will yet join in clean worship before Armageddon's battle establishes the triumph of Jehovah's right worship in all the earth.—Jas. 1: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During December all of God’s servants will want to share in the united worship of Jehovah by placing with the people three bound books, 11'hat </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Has Religion Done for Mankind? “Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of $1.50. If you have not yet placed at least one set, make it your determination to do so in December, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. These publications forcefully bring home the need for clean worship by all who hope to live under Kingdom rule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Success In placements will depend much on having a right mental attitude when approaching the people. There is no question that they need the information in these three books! You know that! But are you so convinced yourself that you are ready to convince others? Mature and positive thinking, and your good conscience, will prompt you to present the offer at every door. Stress specific contents of the books. Endeavor to get the householder’s viewpoint on some subject, and then show how the books provide an answer. Point out the tremendous circulation of the books as an indication of their recognized value.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Take advantage of the opportunity to reach people in a favorable frame of mind during the holiday period. Placements have always been unusually good on such occasions. Plan group witnessing and enjoy a day of real service in the field. A person could receive no greater blessing than to have placed within his reach this vital information dealing with Jehovah’s requirements for clean worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> To place literature you must go to the people. Therefore do not fail to participate in house-to-house serv-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mature Publishers Use Tracts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Are You Using Tracts to Preach the Good News?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> At our recent district assemblies, four additional tracts were released for use in the field. This means that we now have eight timely tracts, covering some of the major doctrines in the Bible, that we can use very effectively in preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Have you formed the habit of leaving an appropriate tract with persons who show some interest but who do not obtain literature? Are you using them when witnessing to friends and neighbors, and otherwise in incidental preaching? If not, you are missing wonderful opportunities to spread the Kingdom message. Oftentimes the leaving of a tract opens the way for a back-call and further occasion to talk to interested persons about the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> By’ carrying a supply of the tracts with us in all features of the service, we are prepared to leave an additional witness on almost all Bible subjects that might be dis-ice. Let no timidity cause any’ publisher to shrink back from presenting the offer. The small contribution asked does not even begin to compare with the great blessings the three books can bring to a righteously disposed person. Where a book placement is not possible, do not forget the possibility of planting a seed through the use of tracts. Homes where placements are made should be marked for a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah is building up his organization of clean worshipers. What are we contributing toward the advance of clean worship? Invite other sheep to join with us in singing Jehovah’s praises now and thus aid them to be among the clean worshipers to survive into the new earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">cussed initially with the people. When we leave them something to read, the oral witness will in most eases be followed up by a private consideration of the subject discussed. In all cases the people will be directed to the only hope, which is Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Tracts can be enclosed with letters that we write to friends and relatives in which we give a witness. And, the tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hope for the Dead </span><span class="font4">is just what we need to distribute at funerals conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses. A brief announcement can be made at the conclusion of the funeral discourse that copies can be obtained from the usher, or they might be placed on a table near the door for the convenience of all who wish copies. Then, too, a tract or booklet can be given out after public meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Tracts definitely have a role to play in our witnessing. Every publisher should use them to the fullest in ‘saying to the prisoners, Go forth!’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;Worship That Is Clean”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we would share in the triumph of clean worship we individually must clean up and then keep clean. (Jas. 1:27) We may confess Jehovah and honor him with our lips, but that will not assure us life if we deny him and bring reproach upon his name by our course of action. As noted in the 1952 &quot;Yearbook” report on British Honduras, clean worship plays a vital role in the expansion of the Theocracy, for people notice the difference between the conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses and of those of the various worldly religious organizations. (95)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report from Honduras tells us of how one company assisted seven couples to clean up by getting legally married, all of whom are now engaging in the pure worship. (153)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those taking their stand In Southern Rhodesia likewise appreciate the importance of pure worship. A native there who some months back had expressed the intention of taking to himself another wife was asked by his mistress why he had not done so. He replied that he was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and that they would not let him join if he had more than one wife. (226) Yes, in Africa as elsewhere, the true worship is succeeding where false religion has failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The stressing of pure worship at one of the district assemblies in Panama so impressed a person of good will that he was heard to remark: &quot;Wheh I get home T am going to straighten out my affairs, and get properly married so I can be counted as a publisher.” (201) Surely the privileges of service and the hope of life in the new world should help us to keep our worship clean and undefiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Strength for All Things’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saying to the prisoners &quot;Go forth!” requires overcoming obstacles in the strength of Jehovah. As Paul expressed it: &quot;For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (Phil. 4:13, NW) Yes, with Jehovah’s help we CAN overcome the obstacles in our way, be they travel problems, weather conditions or opposition by the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One seventy-year-old successful Surinam publisher gets around by means of a dugout canoe. (227, 228) One circuit servant in Newfoundland purchased a small plane so as to be able to reach small, isolated villages in his territory. (179) One Finnish pioneer has ten studies each month, the nearest being 12 and the farthest 22 miles away. In summer he cycles and in winter he skis to his studies. (136)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Is your territory rugged terrain? Is its population widely scattered and highly unstable? Does its temperature get as low as 50 degrees below zero? Does it have steady rains lasting for weeks at a time? Our brothers In Alaska have all such conditions to contend with and yet they were able to report a 29 per cent increase for the 1951 service year. (63, 246)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Strength for all things is also shown by four brothers in Portuguese East Africa who, railroaded to a labor camp, have succeeded in building up a company right within the camp. (197)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To Jewish Persons</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Upon noticing a mezuzah (parchment encased in a wooden or metal case or tube) attached to the doorpost, the Kingdom publisher wonders : “What can I say that would arrest the attention of this Jewish person?” After briefly introducing yourself, you might say something to this effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I am calling in the interest of a cultural and world-wide educational work. I am sure you're interested in education, and you want your children to receive the best education possible. Since accurate knowledge can extend one’s life, education is really important. You know, of course, that even the mezuzah supports this conclusion when it quotes Deuteronomy 11 :13-21, which says that by gaining accurate knowledge of Almighty God’s righteous laws and keeping them your days will be multiplied and you will live long upon the earth. Also you will recall the prophet Hosea speaking for God when he said: ‘My people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee.’—Hosea 4: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I am sure you will readily agree with me that the religion of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob was based on accurate knowledge and was the one pure religion established by Jehovah God, as described in the Hebrew Scriptures. As an aid to gaining this knowledge the book entitled ‘What Has Religion Done for Mankind?’ is published. Notice here on page 33 the description of the time when there was one pure religion on the earth. Each paragraph,</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Public Meeting Handbills</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In the past the Society has accepted handbill orders from companies for the current series of public talks only. That is what we prefer, because it simplifies the task of printing handbills in the large quantities required. However, some companies run a long series of talks in their Kingdom Hall and would like to have a change of subject, aside from the eight current talks, for the benefit of good-will interest. Henceforth the Society will accept orders for handbill titles for two years preceding the current series if ordered in lots of one thousand or more. It will be permissible to order handbills now for any of the talks you will notice, refers you to Scripture citations which you must check with your copy of the Bible. By this means you will gain that desired accurate knowledge of Jehovah God’s purposes which really will mean life to you and your family. After a careful analysis of the eleven basic religions on earth today and their accomplishments, this book points to the only pure religion which will survive all other religions on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Everyone loves life, and this companion study aid entitled 'This Means Everlasting Life’ probes into the subject in detail. It lists the Scripture citations for proof. Since, according to King David in the 100th Psalm, God is our Life-giver, we should permit his Word to be true by letting it be the guiding factor in our life. This third book, entitled ‘Let God Be True’, will show you how he speaks for himself. These Bible study aids will assist you to gain knowledge and understanding of God’s arrangements to restore joy and gladness to people here on the earth, under one nation, by means of a new covenant. (Jer. 31:31-34, Afc&gt;) God is determined to carry out the promises he made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Isaiah and the other faithful men of old. Wouldn't you like to see these promises fulfilled? These three publications, which you may have on a contribution of $1.50, are worth their weight in gold to you in terms of encouragement and hope.” (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom, Publishers,</span><span class="font4"> page 197; June 1, 1952, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> page 32G.) in the 1950 and 1951 series (listed below). After the 1953 series starts next spring, handbills may be ordered for any talks of the 1951 and 1952 series, as well as the 1953 series. This will give a little more variety where desired.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not fail to follow through on November-December book placements. A suggestion on how to do it appears in the first demonstration below. Our service should be stimulated by Kingdom songs we sing at meetings. Do you give thought to the words? They are designed to keep heart and mind fixed on progress to maturity, as illustrated in the second demonstration.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (3 min.) </span><span class="font2">By demonstration or pantomime the publisher is shown finishing presentation of three books, and householder takes them. Publisher then explains that there are many fine features </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in this Bible</span><span class="font2"> library and perhaps when he is in the area again a few more minutes can be spent talking about them. He explains that the purpose of the work is to aid in understanding the Bible and his second call will be to find out if the publications fulfill their purpose. Although the back-call is well planned by the publisher, he makes it appear casual to keep the householder from feeling obligated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (6 min.) Commentator points out that two weeks have elapsed, also that publisher calling back does not start out by asking if books have been read. Rather, he assumes that householder has read “Eet God Be True”. He is invited in by householder and after a few introductory remarks asks if the scripture index was noticed. He then looks in the index of his book and shows the page references to 2 Corinthians 4:4. He shows householder the text in Bible that states ‘the god of this world blinds the minds of the people’. This is puzzling, so he suggests looking up one of the page references to get more information. Householder gets his book and both look up page 56. Publisher reads paragraphs 4 and 5 and paraphrases the question to draw householder out. Then householder is asked to read paragraph 6. The question is discussed and point is thoroughly proved that Satan is god of this system of things. The questions in the 7th paragraph are discussed, but publisher looks at his watch and states he has another call to make. He suggests that question as to why a just and loving God permitted Satan to live be put off till next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (6 min.) </span><span class="font2">One week later. A few friendly remarks are made and publisher refers back to inquiry regarding God's permission of wickedness. They open books to page 57 and begin. Paragraph 8 is read and then discussed through question. Commentator explains that some time has passed and they are now at paragraph 16. The question, ‘‘Why has Jehovah permitted Satan to exist?” has been completely answered. Householder is satisfied but wants to know what future holds for Satan Commentator then relates how study of chapter is completed. On leaving, publisher com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conquering Fear in a Perplexed World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religion—True and False</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Will East Meet West in Peace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Peoples’ Greatest Need</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Evolution and the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Truth About the Trinity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How Long Would You Like to Live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ments that most people have much more respect for Almighty God after they find out why he has permitted wickedness. But to know more about Jehovah, publisher suggests they consider chapter on ‘‘Who Is Jehovah?” next week Householder agrees. Publisher then says he gets more out of chapter by reading it and looking up scriptures ahead of time. He encourages householder to do likewise. Commentator concludes by pointing out how study was started without formal proposal of study, publisher being prepared for effective back-call and tactful follow-up arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Value of Kingdom Songs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">OPENING (2 min.) Conductor discusses whatever may be weaknesses of company, such as house-to-house work, Bible studies, street work, etc. He mentions value of Kingdom songs in this connection. We sing many songs, based on scriptures. Do we sing them with a real appreciation of what we are singing? Are we actually doers of what we sing? Or is it a formalism as with false religions? How can the songs help us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (4 min.) Publisher looks at three-book offer, comments on merits of each book; but because he failed to place any books the last time he was out he decides offer is not for him. So he stays at home. As he does chores about the house Kingdom song No. 87 comes to his mind. (Here a hidden voice reads or sings verse two, accompanied by piano if possible.) He pauses, goes over words himself, exclaims how well they fit or apply to him. Hurries to meet group for field service, taking two sets of three books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (10 min.) A </span><span class="font2">series of scenes (which may be pantomimed) showing publishers doing things incorrectly, with conductor commenting thereon. Then as he points out the right way to do such things, as mentioned in songs 28, 59, 34, 49, 66, etc. (words of song to be sung with accompaniment if possible), light dawns on publisher and he changes to doing things correctly: (1) From rude and tactless house-to-house presentation to kind and gentle (Song 28, verse 2); (2) from fearful street presentation to confident and alert (Song 59, verse 1); (3) from arguing with or ignoring one’s brother to showing him love (Song 34, verse 2); (4) from letting worldly cares overcome one to rising above them (Song 49, verse 2); (5) from one-feature publisher to well-balanced publisher engaging in all fields of service (Song </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">78 verse</span><span class="font2"> 3). If time permits, Song 66, verse 3 can be used as a finale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CLOSING REMARKS (2 min.) Con</span><span class="font2">ductor clinches points by showing how profitable it is to know words of Kingdom songs, think of words as we sing, look up scriptures they are based on, make them live, make them more a part of our everyday lives. The scriptures on which they are based will be more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">easily</span><span class="font2"> remembered, will strengthen us in time of need.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Plan Vacations to Attend the World Assembly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">“Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” Can a farmer plant seed a few days before harvesttime and reap fruitage? No, he certainly cannot. He must plant seed at the proper time if a crop is to be harvested. Does not this principle apply in planning vacations to theocratic advantage? If an effort to arrange a vacation is first made shortly before the world assembly, the results may be as unfruitful as those experienced by the late-planting farmer. Have you arranged vacation dates so you will be in New York city July 19 to 26, 1953?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing the assembly dates and the number of days required to travel to and from New York, you can arrange your vacation accordingly. The Society announces conventions far in advance so as to give brothers this opportunity to plan their vacations. Has your employer scheduled your vacation during July, 1953? Do not leave the matter to chance. Why not let your employer know your preference for next year? We believe you will find him co-operative, and that he will appreciate your advising him at an early date so he can plan his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now is thp time to plant the vacation seed if you want to reap a rich harvest at the world assembly. (However, please do not write to the Society or anyone in New York about rooms or trailer camp until the Society makes announcement on these. It will save us extra work at New York. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will make proper announcement in due course.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Literature Credit Requests</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">A good many companies that provide literature for pioneers do not forward the Literature Credit Request (SC-53) form regularly. It will help matters greatly, both for the Society and for companies, if the brothers will see to it that these credit requests are forwarded to the Society once each month, not later than the tenth of the month, as stated on the form. Company inventories and accounts will then be more accurate, and the Society’s records will be up to date. Be certain to fill out this form completely. Oftentimes the names of pioneers who obtain literature are omitted, making it necessary to return the credit request. Careful co-operation will save time and work.</span></p>

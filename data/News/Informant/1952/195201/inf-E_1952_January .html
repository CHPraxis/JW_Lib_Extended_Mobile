<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s King and kingdom are here! The judgment is on! Nearer! nearer! draws the final day when Satan’s entire organization will be made a desolation and waste. Who will tell this good news? Who will sound the warning? Even as Isaiah of old, thousands of God’s servants whose lips have been cleansed now cry out, “Here am I; send me!” And to those thousands of servants plain and unmistakable is Jehovah’s command to go and tell the people “until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste” —Isa. 6: 11,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> While the cities are still inhabited and opportunity yet remains, God’s faithful servants will continue telling the people by presenting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from house to house to all persons during the next four months. This will be offered on a subscription basis of $1 a year. Any three booklets will be given as a premium. Those who wish may offer both </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake! on</span><span class="font5"> a subscription basis of $2 a year, along with a premium of six booklets. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! can be offered to</span><span class="font5"> those already subscribing for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toicer.</span><span class="font5"> A list of the many languages in which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is printed can be found on the inside of the front cover. The campaign quota is 2 for each company publisher, and 16 for each pioneer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Individual Preparation Essential</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Are you prepared to present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower!</span><span class="font5"> Do you know what it contains? Can you show and prove its tremendous value? Are you subscription conscious? For your answer to be Yes, individual preparation is essential. Prepare by reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and noting outstanding points and questions of interest in the issue you are illustrating at the door. Call attention to the various attractive features. Note that it is the only magazine announcing God’s kingdom; that it has over a million and a quarter circulation ; that a year’s subscription represents a volume </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> 768 pages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Individual preparation will include having the mind think positively and confidently. Do this by preparing and practicing a presentation orally with members of the family or other brothers. Make definite arrangements to engage in field service some time during the week. Be on time at the contact points. For greater results, get an early start and plan to stay longer in the field. Where sample copies are placed, call back to get subscriptions. Publishers should also call back on all subscribers and leave with them the current issue as it comes out until their magazine begins to come through the mail. The main objective in calling back is to arrange to start a study. Fill out all subscription forms correctly and plainly and thus avoid many diffi-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Is witnessing being done in all territory in the United States now? Many thousands assembled in convention at Washington, D. C., October 12-14, 1951, were surprised to learn that of 3.062 counties in the United States, almost 50 per cent of them, or a total of 1,469 counties, are completely unworked or receiving only partial attention. That means millions of persons in the United States are not fieing served from the theocratic table Jehovah has provided for all persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this is soon to be changed was manifest to all when at the close of the assembly the Society’s president advised that an arrangement would be made by the Society so that company publishers and pioneers could work this territory culties later. Every publisher should himself be a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriber and thus have his own personal copy and also have his name and address on file at the Society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning with this issue of the Informant, “Around the World with Jehovah's Witnesses” will be a regular feature, and will be based on the experiences appearing in the Yearbook. A consideration of these will not only be enjoyable but very profitable. It will give us practical examples which will in turn help us to be more efficient, more appreciative and more zealous publishers. Suggestions will be given for good, lively, interesting discussions and demonstrations for two meetings each month. At these demonstrations two or three brothers (or sisters) will talk about or demonstrate the experiences. One may speak as though he lived in the country under discussion and another may ask questions and elaborate on the comments. If time permits, other information rel-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society will soon be sending to each company and pioneer a complete list of unassigned territory, an application blank for selecting territory desired and instructions covering the work in unassigned territory during this special campaign. The company servant should schedule this material for discussion at the service meeting immediately, assemble the information desired and forward the company’s request for a share in this special work to this office by February 1, 1952. Pioneers who will work with the company should not submit an application, for they should be included in the company’s request.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Preach ... in troublesome season”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Increasing intensity of the East-West conflict and the spreading of totalitarian restraints means more and more of ‘preaching the Word in troublesome season’ for Jehovah’s ministers, for they are determined to remain true to their commission regardless of what the Devil’s agents may bring against them. (2 Tim. 4:2, Jiff) The 1952 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year-hook</span><span class="font5"> contains many examples of such preaching in troublesome season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past service year the police in Hungary occupied the branch office, carried oft the brothers to unknown destinations and appropriated the equipment. Did that stop the witness work there? Not at all. In spite of such troublesome season, our brothers continue “courageous and spiritually strong”, and preach the Word with their Bibles, among their number being 21 pioneers. (155, 156)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our brothers in the Belgian Congo are setting a like example. Isolated reports filtering through tell of deportations, imprisonments, beatings and other ill treatment endured by God’s ministers there. Through it all they are continuing to preach the Word, and the good news of the Kingdom is being heard by ever-increasing numbers. (189, 190)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Paul’s injunction to preach in troublesome season is also being carried out in the Dominican Republic, where “the faith of those who want to serve Jehovah is being tested and tried from every angle” and where even walking on the street with the Watchtower publications in one’s possession is an offense against the state. (123-125) Surely the faithful example of our brothers in such lands should stimulate all who can still preach in favorable season to greater zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Youthful Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That theocratically trained children, and even those of good will, are having a share in the witness work is another fact that is forcibly brought home to us as we go round the world with Jehovah’s witnesses by means of our 1952 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from Brazil tells of a 10-year-old boy being instrumental in bringing his parents out from the prison house. (92) An experience telling of how a 13-year-old girl</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>By Placing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Offer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">With another world-wide </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign here, all of Jehovah’s witnesses should be making preparations to make this campaign the greatest yet. So to aid in this preparation, a few examples are here presented from the January 1. 1952, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Using the “Purpose of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower&quot;</span><span class="font5"> on the inside of the cover, one might give a witness like this: “Note a few points about the purpose of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> It is founded on God’s Word, the Bible. This elevates it above racial, national and political propagandas and prejudices and frees it- from selfish bias. Its message advances as the light on God’s purposes and works increases. (Quote Habakkuk 2:1-3.) This journal does not parrot the old fable about history repeating itself, but sees in present conditions the world’s time of the end and the best of times in a new world of righteousness to follow. This publication does not interpret Bible prophecy, but sets it alongside physical events and lets the prophecy interpret itself. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is a vital publication for everyone who wants to keep a watch on current conditions and the Bible prophecies to which they are related.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Questions from Readers” amazed a gentleman with her Scriptural presentation Is found in the report on the Saar. (139) And the report on the Netherlands West Indies calls particular attention to the activities of the children and the part they are having in the increase. For instance, there the Gilead missionaries have found it profitable to take young publishers with them to home Bible studies. The answers these children give to Bible questions often amaze the new persons of good will and cause them to speak up also. (177) What are our youthful ministers doing? And what are we doing to help them to have a share in the expansion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above merely gives the gist or pith of the material to be used. For completely developing it and rounding it out as to details, local color, etc., please see the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font5">The page numbers are given in parentheses () for this purpose. section can be used thus: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> will actually answer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font5"> Bible questions, for a section of the magazine is devoted to questions from the readers. For instance, did you ever wonder if Jesus knew, while yet a child, that he was to be the Messiah and that he had formerly existed as a spirit creature, the Logos? Well, that question is answered in this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Often, objections can be overcome by being familiar with the material in the issue you have. For instance, if someone states, “Oh, I go to the church down the street every Sunday,” you could reply, “I’m glad to know that. But is that enough? Let me read you paragraphs 12 and 13 of the article, ‘Organizing for the Ministry,’ and see if you don’t agree with them. (Read) Now the purpose of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is to come into your home twice a month and provide the material that will help you work toward the point of helping others to take in lifegiving knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should familiarize ourselves with more of these features of interest, because the main articles, their questions and the information on the inside of the cover, such as the list of languages, number of copies printed, table of contents and Bible translations used, can often be employed with telling effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tell the People . . . (</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The various servant departments should keep the campaign activity in steady motion. Publishers should note good points in demonstrations for effectively presenting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and overcoming objections. Have the experienced publishers work with the inexperienced, assisting them to become more mature publishers. Also help the irregular to become regular. Every effort should be made on the part of all publishers to have a share in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The days of Satan’s organization are numbered. God’s undeserved kindness toward this marked and doomed generation will not continue indefinitely. Jehovah’s command to his servants now is to go and tell the people of his King and kingdom and the nearness of his day of vengeance. Redeem the time! Help the prisoners to go forth by taking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> into every home while they are still with inhabitants.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Al! Kingdom publishers appreciating the true value of “The Watchtower” will want to present it effectively and obtain as many subscriptions as possible. For maximum results, each publisher should prepare to regularly engage in door-to-door work. By having in mind the opening words and general outline of what is to be said, publishers will be confident at the door. It means preparing in advance. The following demonstrations offer suggestions as to how a publisher can prepare to have a full part in the campaign and assist others to have a share in it.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE ONE: (3 minutes) Sister at door presents “Watchtower” offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 1 Mentions perilous times, and introduces “The Watchtower” as an aid to daily living. Householder says he (or she) is not interested, and ib very busy and gets all information he wants about world events from “Picture” magazine, which gives him a quick and comprehensive view of world situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 2 Witness then goes to another home, where the lady of the house says that she cares for all her reli-’ gious needs through her church magazine, “Clergy Weekly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE TWO: (10 minutes) Witness walks home dejectedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Talking to herself, “I know ‘The Watchtower’ is far superior to those magazines, but I just wish I could put it into words.” As she sits there comparing some worldly magazines with “The Watchtower”, two brothers (or sisters), one labeled “Picture” and the other “Clergy Weekly”, approach from one side of the stage toward a brother (or sister) labeled “The Watchtower”, who approaches from the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here, near the middle of the platform, an argument ensues, “Picture” arguing that he brings actual views of life as it exists so his readers can see conditions; three million people see weekly the horrors of war and terrible conditions in the world. Argument goes back and forth, ••picture” answering “Watchtower’s” argument by saying he shows the efforts of U. N. and others to bring peace. “Watchtower” says he tells his readers how these conditions fit the prophecies, he gives a glorious hope and a new world outlook; he offers readers a way of life and a way to face today’s vital issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Clergy” steps up, pompously says he does that by showing his readeis how to be better citizens and to help the world; his writers are prominent theologians; they know what is best for us, “Clergy” also reflects creeds long taught and cherished; he stirs people emotionally and sentimentally. “Watchtower” asks “Clergy” if he tells that this world will soon be destroyed or if he hides that truth; he shows how the Pharisees were prominent, but as Jesus did, he (“watchtower”) expresses not the opinions of men, but of God and makes God’s Word a living book for our practical guidance. He describes how “Clergy” fails to bring real help, but “Watchtower” presents product of real Bible research and builds up intellectually and spiritually, is alive and fresh, not creedal. Thus neither “Picture” nor “Clergy” can compare with him. That is why “Watchtower’s” name is becoming a household word in 36 languages and his circulation of well over a million is growing by hundreds of thousands. The argument should go back and forth in a lively way. At end “Picture” and “Clergy ’ hang heads in shame and say that they seem to have fallen down on the job, and certainly can’t object to letting “Watchtower” into a home, even though they came in first. Now publisher throws worldly magazines aside, concentrates on “Watchtower”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE THREE: (2 minutes) “Magazines” withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A hidden voice (or a brother coming to the platform) says, “So you see, the witness could have said, ‘You need “The Watchtower”, for: (and then he briefly states 6 or 7 of the points made, such as,) It is the only magazine that makes the Bible a living book for us, that gives a new world outlook,’ ” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While these things are being said, witness, with a joyful look, recounts on her fingers the things she could have said, and encouraged, picks up her book bag, starts back in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE ONE: Publisher is at home thinking about the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 1 (4 minutes) Talking aloud to himself, he says the “Watchtower” campaign has started and he wants to do his part. Last year he remembers he did well, especially at the last part of the campaign, when he obtained most of his subscriptions. Why was he more successful toward latter half of campaign? Oh, yes, he had developed a good presentation by then and it was effective. So why not start with a good one and be successful all the way through? Deciding he had better think out the witness he will use, he takes the latest “Informant” and current “Watchtower” and proceeds to work up what he will say and points he will use at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Part 2 (6 minutes) Having in mind what he will say, he goes to his wife and tells her he would like to have her listen to his offer and note points for improvement. He gives a complete witness after which they have a short discussion on points used. To the question, “Have you prepared your offer?” she replies No. He encourages her to do so and then remembers the study conductor asked him to assist Brother “A” to join in the work. A telephone call is made to Brother “A”, encouragement given to enjoy a part' in the work and arrangements made to pick him up on the way to the contact point next morning. Publisher and wife, happy over outcome, take seats in audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE TWO: (10 minutes) Sunday morning contact point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Study conductor discusses morning text with group (may use entire service meeting audience as publishers who are assembled for service) and then briefly comments on offer to be used. Since many have been privileged to take part in previous campaigns and all have prepared in harmony with the “Informant’s” suggestion, study conductor asks audience for good points and ways they have found effective in presenting “The Watchtower”. (Company should be advised to prepare one week before meeting night so good suggestions will be forthcoming at this time.) After hearing several, conductor sums up good points and then asks if someone will demonstrate just what he will say at the first door, for in just a few minutes all assembled will be going from door to door and all should now have in mind what they will say. Brother in Scene One who prepared and practiced with wife raises his hand. He is called upon to come to platform and present offer to study conductor, who acts as householder. Then all are dismissed for field service.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>‘Apply Yourself to Public Reading’</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">As students prepare their assignments for the theocratic ministry school under the new arrangement, there are a few points that should be kept in mind. First of all, it should not be concluded that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> reading assignment will be an easy one and will require less preparation. The student should read his material aloud many times in order to get the proper sense stress, put in proper pauses, pronounce the words correctly and acquire fluency. He should inject enthusiasm and force into his reading. Reading should be natural and expressive so it will not sound as though the material is being read. The material should be made alive such as the Word of the Lord is. A review of chapters 16 and 17 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font5"> will help the student immensely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first two student talks may have a brief introduction. Two or three brief sentences are sufficient to establish the setting for the material to be read and tell who is speaking the words in the account, etc. Then a few words in summary will serve to conclude the talks after the 4 or 5 analytical points are given. Before counsel is given by the school servant the audience will be given the opportunity to mention changes they noticed which the speaker did not mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The school servant should do the assigning of those who are to assist the brothers talking on the chain words. He should try to get all publishers, brothers and sisters, to take part in this work. The two assigned to consider the chain word as on a back-call should rehearse their parts and make the discussion conversational and instructive. The question to be answered by the third student speaker should be stated clearly in the introduction so that ail in the audience will know it and be able to express themselves as to whether or not he properly answered the question. However, remember the audience does not counsel the student on deliveby. The school servant does this in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everyone should read over the assignments before they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are con</span><span class="font5">sidered in the school and be prepared to comment. Brothers not now enrolled should be encouraged to do so. All, including children, elderly brothers, and those with language difficulties can derive much benefit by attending the school. Remember, whatever you put into the school you will get out of it. Hence, “Continue applying yourself to public reading.”—1 Tim. 4:13, AW.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Theocracy’s Increase” Witnessing Period</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Back-Calls and Bible Studies to Be Stressed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s organization is one that is continually increasing. But does this surprise his true worshipers? No! Because they know that the scripture at Zechariah 2:4 predicted : “Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.’’ What do you think contributes to this increase of the Theocracy? Chiefly, it is the making of back-calls and the conducting of home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us, then, during this second month of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign call back on all persons who showed some interest. By all means let us call back on those who did subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and show them how they can get the most out of it. Back-calls and Bible studies</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Follow Up Subscriptions with No. 7 Bible</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the persons that will subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> during the months of January to April may not have a Bible in their home and very few will have the No. 7 Bible entitled the “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures&quot;. It would be excellent if they could have this new translation to read along with their magazine. Therefore we suggest that you follow up every subscription by making back-calls, and a week or two after they have started getting their magazine through the mail offer them the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rew World Translation of the Christian Grech Scriptures.</span><span class="font5"> Show them its contents, read portions of it so that they may realize its value and how it will be a great aid to them to better understand God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If companies need the No. 7 Bible they may order them from Brooklyn, as they are available in stock.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Publishers’ Edition</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Many companies had their orders for publishers’ edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> canceled because the Society ran out of stock of the original printing. We received expressions of regret that personal copies of the publishers’ edition could not be obtained. However, we have been successful in obtaining a small stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A theocratic publisher proclaims the good news of the Kingdom under the direction of the Lord and his organization. Thus he becomes one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He does his preaching in a spirit of love and willingness. With the proper mental attitude each publisher understands what he is doing and sincerely serves God in an intelligent manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of Jehovah’s witnesses seeks to daily improve his ministry by applying' the wise counsel of God’s Word, the Bible. Further, he cooperates with the Lord’s visible governing organization and follows theocratic counsel in order that all will walk together in complete unity. (Matt. 24:45-47, A'IF) Seeing the importance of the local company arrangement, he fully supports it in all ways so that the Kingdom Interests might be properly expanded. In doing so he recognizes the position of the various appointed servants and seeks to co-operate with them. (1 Thess. 5:12,13, 1VIF) He endeavors to attend all theocratic meetings and assemblies arranged for his spiritual welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He strives to be tactful, efficient, diligent and regular in all branches of the field activity. This field service should then be accurately and promptly reported. (1 Tim. 4:16, A<sup>7</sup>IF) This labor of love is put foremost in his life and for this he is prepared to live and, if necessary, die. He keeps on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and does not allow old world pursuits to infringe upon this all-important vocation. (1 Pet. 1:14; Col. 4:5) He keeps himself neat in appearance and at all times conducts himself properly, in a manner befitting a Christian. At all times the publisher makes opportunities to preach the good news to the fullest extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A company publisher appreciating his relationship to the Lord and desiring to increase his privileges of service will desire to symbolize his dedication at the earliest opportunity by water immersion, if he has not already done so. (Matt. 3:15, .VW) Taking this step and executing his covenant obligations he can then be properly called a “minister of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you fully measure up to the above qualifications? Examine your position, your conduct, your motives. Can improvement be made? If so, act to your greatest benefit by conforming yourself to these righteous principles.</span></p>

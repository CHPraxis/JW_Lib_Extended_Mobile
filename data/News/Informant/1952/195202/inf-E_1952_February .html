</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Increased Praise Schedule</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">“Jerusalem shall be inhabited like unwalled villages, because of the mass of men and beasts within her.” (Zech. 2: 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AT; Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> January 1, 1951) In these last days Jehovah God has built up his organization, Jerusalem, and brought about Theocracy’s increase. But people in the ‘great city’ are not idle! They continue to spread out and preach the message of God’s kingdom to the ends of the earth so that all shall know that Jehovah is the Supreme One of the universe and that the vindication of his name and word is near at hand. Being citizens of the new world organization, let us share in praising our God and King by offering subscriptions for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines, with the premium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our house-to-house work will continue as a regular feature of our service activity. But there is also the responsibility of calling back on all persons who showed interest by taking a copy of the magazine, booklet or book and those who expressed a desire to subscribe. Caring for these calls and conducting home Bible studies are activities of vital importance in the Lord’s work. That this has the Lord’s blessing is proved by the tremendous growth of the ‘unwalled city’. Results go hand in hand with such efforts in cultivating the field of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When obtaining subscriptions&quot;'or otherwise finding Interested persons we should be diligent to accept the responsibility of caring for these sheeplike ones. We should make a complete record of interest found and then water and nourish this interest for continued increase. Regular calls on these persons, designed to increase their knowledge of the Creator and his purposes and to bring them to full-bodied’maturity, need to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To properly care for our Godgiven responsibility of ‘feeding the sheep’ group contacts should be well organized. It has been found that 9:30 a.m. Sunday is the best time for the publishers to assemble for group service. Discussion of the daily text and a consideration of the activity for the day should start </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">promptly</span><span class="font4"> at the appointed time. Brief quizzes, discussions, experiences, demonstrations, or reviews, based on previous service meetings, may be prepared and presented for refreshment and stimulation before going afield. The entire meeting need be no longer than 15 minutes, thereby making it possible for all to be in the field by 10:00 a.m. for a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font4"> day of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many publishers have found it practical to start the day’s activity with a couple of hours of house-to-house activity, eat a lunch while still in the field and then continue into the afternoon by calling back on persons who previously displayed interest and starting and conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So prepare for and take an active part in Theocracy’s increase now by uniting yourself with your brothers world-wide in this great witness work.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Follow-up Procedure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">To improve the organizing of efficient follow-up of subscriptions and eliminating many unnecessary expirations the following procedure is recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When subscriptions are turned in by the publishers the company servant should see that they are written up properly by the accounts servant on the S-10 form in triplicate. (Note on the form the date and the name of the publisher obtaining each subscription.) The original copy, after being thoroughly double-checked and signed by the company servant, will be forwarded to the Society each week as usual, the duplicate copy filed by the accounts servant and the triplicate copy given to the Bible study servant. The Bible study servant will see that the information on the new subscriptions is listed on</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Postal Rate Increase</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the increase in postal rates, effective January 1, 1952, all who correspond with the Society using postal cards (pioneers Included) will be required to use two cents in postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Returned Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During 1951 the post office returned well over 72,000 magazines to this office, which could not. be delivered for the following reasons: “not found, no such street, no such number, unknown and unclaimed.” This averages over 6,000 magazines per month. Since this costs the Society 2 cents for each return it amounts to well over $120 monthly, or upward of $1,500 yearly, and now the cost on these returned, undelivered magazines is to be increased to 5 cents per copy. Therefore, the</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Public Meetings for 1952</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In Kingdom Halls, homes, public parks, on mountainsides and on the seashore, the Kingdom message was sounded forth in 1951 through the medium of public meetings. There was a total of 225,399 lectures given during the 1951 service year, making an average of 618 per day! Now we look to 1952 for an increase in this feature of service, as another way </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3) </span><span class="font4">a separate sheet of paper and given to the company book study conductor. Of course, the publisher will continue to keep a record of his own subscriptions and will call back to deliver the current issue until the magazine has started coming to the subscriber through the mail. In about six weeks from the time of obtaining the subscription, the company book study conductor will check to see that back-calls are being made by the publishers obtaining the original subscriptions. He should oversee the follow-up activity by utilizing this list of subscribers when at back-call contact points, on company book study nights or other appropriate times and render such assistance as possible in getting publishers started in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. J)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower” Aids Men of Good Will</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Second only to the Bi^le itself Is the place “The Watchtower” occupies in the hearts and minds of the servants of Jehovah. It has been stressed so much by them as to be synonymous with them and their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report on Canada appearing- in the 1952 “Yearbook” calls attention to how greatly improved “The Watchtower” is in its new form: “convenient size, the rich variety of subjects covered, the interest-gripping headings and illustrations, and the satisfying answers to the readers’ Questions.” Appreciating these points will help us in our presentation. (106)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United States report tells of a mother of 17 children who, as the result of reading “The Watchtower” over a period of years, wrote the Society for instructions on how she too could ha\e a part in the witness work. (61) But would it have taken years for that mother to see her privileges of service if someone had studied “The Watchtower” with her? The report from Turkey tells of two women of good will becoming publishers within one month of the time one of Jehovah’s witnesses began a study with one of them on the illustration of the sower. (237, 238)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Watchtower” also helps men of good will to see what are God’s righteous requirements Certain “church” members in British Guiana took “The Watchtower” on “Marriage” to their clergyman, in defense of a person divorced on Scriptural grounds who wanted to remarry. They won their argument. (94) What a privilege is ours to help men of good will!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theocracy’s Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s prophet Zechariah, foretelling Theocracy’s increase, said that “Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein”. (2:4) Why without walls? Because walls would Interfere with the expansion of Jehovah’s organization. The aptness of the simile and the various ways in which this prophecy is being fulfilled today are forcibly brought to our attention in the “Yearbook”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The advertising of public meetings plays a vital part in Theocracy’s increase. Said a Swedish newspaper: “One day in the spring an energetic gentleman appeared in this community and started to invite people to a lecture ... It did not [take] long until the lectures had to be held out of doors for lack of space.” (231)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And the part circuit assemblies play in Theocracy's increase is noted in the report from El Salvador. As a result of a circuit assembly at San Miguel, “The hall overflowed for every public talk, so more walls had to come out, and to date we have removed three walls, and each time the hall has filled right up to its new capacity as if by miracle.” (132)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Missionary activity is another vital factor in Theocracy’s increase as seen by the report from Uruguay. “To accommodate the many new attenders seine good people have opened up their private homes for company meeting places. One brother tore out a brick wall . . . and ... is going to do away with another wall to make [the room where the meetings are being held] still larger. Six missionaries in a small city . . . now find that they have to enlarge their dining room and use it to accommodate the people.” (238, 239) Truly, literally as well as symbolically, Zechariah’s prophecy is finding fulfillment in our day, ana the various kinds of activity are all having a part therein.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To Those Who Say, “I Have No Money”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">“I have no money” is often heard from a householder when offered a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">What the householder usually means is ‘I have no money for magazine subscriptions’, thinking </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is just another magazine. With this in mind a publisher might tactfully say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘It is true the cost of living has increased and all of us have to be careful about how we spend money. However, having in mind Jesus’ words that ‘man does not live by bread alone, hut by every word proceeding out of the mouth of God’, an understanding of the Word of God is of great value to us, especially in these days of crisis. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is a Bible study aid to guide lovers of righteousness to understand God’s Word and is recommended to you as indispensable in properly understanding world events. A year’s subscription, on a contribution of $1, will mean that a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will be delivered to your home through the mail twice every month. Just as it is very essential that we eat our daily bread to keep strong and healthy physically, so it is important to take in knowledge of God’s purposes regularly to stay healthy spiritually. Knowing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will provide such a rich spiritual feast for you. I will be glad to take your subscription for a year at the nominal cost of $1.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or he might say: “Having to face</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Postal Rate Increase </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font4">accounts servant and all publishers who take subscriptions should feel their responsibility to see that all addresses are properly checked for accuracy and legibility before forwarding the subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two outstanding reasons for this problem: The subscriber does not advise us sufficiently in advance of the time he changes his address: and the subscription slips are not being tilled out completely and correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Change of Address</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are going to move notify the Society of the new address immediately, using the Change of Address form S-20. Before sending it in ask yourself, Is the new as well as the old address given? Did I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font4">similar problems as you do, I appreciate the fact that high costs of food, clothing and home requirements leave little balance in the family budget for many things we want. Also, a dollar is not worth much in actual purchase value these days. However, I feel that the peace of mind and sense of security that a knowledge of God’s Word gives is what you really desire, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is a distinct aid to this end. So it is a pleasure for me to be able to offer you a year’s subscription for only $1. If your family budget cannot care for an expenditure of $1 at this moment, then I will be glad to call next week when I will be in your neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also, a publisher might reply by saying: “Even if you are not in position to subscribe just now, I would like to show you the features of this exceptional magazine which has a circulation of over 1,300,000 copies per issue and is studied by Christians all over the world.” Then proceed to call attention to its various features, the purpose of the magazine, what the main article deals with, questions from readers, etc. Often a householder will see that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is not just </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">another</span><span class="font4"> magazine and will subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you do not obtain a subscription after tactfully dealing with this objection, offer a single copy of the magazine on a 5c contribution. This will provide them with an opportunity to become acquainted with its true value and furnish a basis for you to make return calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">state clearly which magazine is involved? Did I show the expiration symbols on .label? (e.g., W or G N 52) If a person of good will, a person with whom we study or on whom we make back-calls is going to move assist him to notify the Society. Supply him with the Change of Address form S-20 and explain its use. Company servants, stock servants, circuit and district servants as well as all pioneers should also always use the Change of Address form. It should be at the Society’s office three weeks before change is effective to allow ample time to make the change of address. Your co-operating with the suggestions offered here will assist greatly toward eliminating the unnecessary expense and burden caused by magazines’ being returned.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Now that two demonstrations are presented here each month, two different points can be stressed. This month, the first demonstration shows how the two new uses of the S-10 form, that is, the procedure in following up new subscriptions and obtaining renewal subscriptions, will be put into operation. The second one demonstrates the need of training for the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I: Calling back on the new subscribers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Part A (7 minutes) Company servant, Bible study servant, accounts servant and at least one company book study conductor arc engaged in a lively discussion of the new procedure. Company servant, explaining system, emphasizes that accounts servant will make out S-10 in triplicate, stressing need for double-checking for accuracy and legibility. He will note on it names of publishers who placed subscriptions and give one copy to Bible study servant. About six weeks after receiving S-10, Bible study servant will make out lists of subscriptions received along with names of publishers who placed them. He will give lists to company book study conductors. Study conductors will check with publishers who placed subscriptions to see that back-calls are being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part B (3 minutes) A study conductor, after company study, is checking with publishers and brie fl y explaining why this is done and importance of calling back on subscribers. Publishers express appreciation for reminder even though they had been calling back with each current issue of magazine. Study conductor mentions that he will have to check with one publisher on back-call day since he was not able to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part C (2 minutes) Publisher continues to follow through by calling on subscriber with current issue again even though six weeks have passed since subscription was placed This should be very brief, and only the introduction need be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II: Calling back to get renewal subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part A (5 minutes) Above-mentioned servants continue discussion started in first scene, taking up use of S-10 in obtaining renewals. One or two months before subscriptions expire, Bible study servant makes out subscription blanks and gives them to study conductors. For this year, since in some cases the names of publishers who placed subscriptions are not available, Bible study servant can see if expiring subscriptions belong to those with whom Bible studies are conducted. If so, conductor's name is noted so that he will be approached concerning the call. If publishers have back-calls on some whose names are listed, they should call for the renewal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part B (3 minutes) Company study is just closing. Study conductor is giving out subscription slips handed to him by Bible study servant. One slip is given to a publisher who conducts a study with the subscriber. Another is given to a publisher who obtained subscription almost a year ago. Some slips are left over because a publisher moved and others because ones who placed subscriptions could not bo determined. These slips are given to various publishers. A publisher recognizes the name on an unassigned slip and it is given to him. Some unassigned slips still remain to be used at contact points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part C (2 minutes) The final part of demonstration shows a publisher just leaving a home after obtaining a renewal. He is assuring householder that when the renewal notice appears in his magazine he may ignore it and that he will call again as arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Seeing Ourselves as Others See Us”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brother with a microphone (or facsimile) announces, “I am your sidewalk radio reporter. An item of interest in this town is the ‘Watchtower’ people, whom I always see on the street. 1 am going to devote tonight's program to interviewing our citizens concerning this magazine, ‘The Watchtower.’ ” People (prepared with answers beforehand) are walking by, and he stops some and asks them questions, as, “What do you think of the ‘Watchtower’ people?” or “Do you take ‘The Watchtower’?” To their answers, he asks, “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One man answers he never took a magazine because he didn’t know the Witnesses wanted him to take one; the way they stand just holding up the magazines like a signpost, he thought they were merely advertising it. Another says he approached one Witness who didn’t try to tell him what was in the magazine, and even hesitated about handing him one to look at. A third says a Witness came to his door, but what a shape the magazine was in! All marked up and wrinkled, besides, all the Witness seemed interested in was getting subscriptions, he couldn’t tell him anything of interest in the magazine; it looked like an ancient copy anyway. One says he is a subscriber to “The Watchtower”. He took it because he noticed the Witnesses so diligently and consistently on the street, and they seemed to have such belief that “The Watchtower” would help the people. Another subscriber explains how a Witness approached him while he was sitting in his car and enthusiastically showed ,&lt;that here was something he would find to be absorbing reading while waiting; he did, and on approaching the Witness two weeks later for another copy, the subscription offer was made and he accepted it. A lady says she took “The Watchtower” at her home. Why? My! the interesting features the Witness showed her; how he referred from it right to the Bible since then he has come back and, with each issue, shows her things she can tell her whole family, until she has got them all reading it now. A man complains that he subscribed but never got a copy, until some other Witness came months later and found that the subscription slip had been filled out wrong; it certainly seemed an unbusinesslike and slipshod way to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reporter questions several, showing the way the people view us as we do the work in a right or in a poor, unprepared manner. He breaks the conversations up by interjecting remarks, as a sidewalk reporter does. Afterward he finds a Witness doing street work. Approaching him, he asks why the ones who manage his local organization do not train all their ‘ministers better, or use the good ones to go with the less-trained ones. The Witness answers that this is done, but that lie believes the citizens’ views certainly show the need of more such training.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Use of S-5 Forms</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ahcaps</span><span class="font4"> indicate number of publishers and pioneers in space provided on the Order Blank form S-5. Note: Cash items (cash Items include certain forms) are listed separately on the S-5 order form. Remittance must accompany order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Coni’d) </span><span class="font4">of ‘saying to the prisoners, Go forth’. The eight new talks will be:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Free Mind in an Enslaved World Why Is the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical for Our Day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Warning to a Wicked Generation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Training Children for Life Armageddon—the War to End War Death—Friend or Foe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What Has Happened to Morals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Is'God Responsible</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for World Distress?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These talks may be started </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">the week end following the Memorial (April 12, 13), or as soon thereafter as possible. No series of 1951 talks should be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">started</span><span class="font4"> after April 13, although a series already in progress may </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">end,</span><span class="font4"> after that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three sets of outlines for each company and one set for each male pioneer are being sent with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> One of the three should be tiled in the ministry school library and the other two distributed to those assigned to prepare the talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Starting March 2 the circuit servant will give the new talk, “What Does God Require of You?” The district servant will soon give the talk, &quot;What Religion Will Survive the World Crisis?” at circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speakers, in preparing talks, should keep in mind that our work is not only to tear down false ideas but primarily to build up by expounding the truth. Most people are convinced that present systems are inadequate, and see world wickedness and distress, without our going to great lengths to prove it with a profusion of observations and clippings. While it is necessary to consider these things briefly, we should emphasize and develop what the people are most interested in, that is, the remedy for such conditions. When dealing with false religious doctrines, avoid prejudice, assertions and sarcasm. Drive your points home with Scriptural proof and logic. Adhere to the time allotted each point on the outline and have a well-rounded-out exposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please keep the following points in mind when ordering handbills: Handbills are printed for current talks only; other subjects may be used, but the Society will be unable to supply handbills. (See February 1950 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> for details.) Order at least one month in advance in the East, six weeks in the West. Order for new series as soon as you can complete arrangements. Fill out order blank carefully. Double-cheek each item. Write Handbill Obdeb on the outside of your envelope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Follow-up </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font4">this feature of work. Duplication of calls can be eliminated by making sure that the original obtalner makes the back-call If at all possible. Some will make the calls unassisted, others will want aid and some may not be able to take part due to circumstances. In that case these calls will then be assigned to other publishers. The purpose of the call will be to stimulate Interest in the magazine, get the subscriber to read its contents and endeavor to start a study in the magazine just as we do with other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A month or two prior to the expiration of the subscription these good-will persons should be called upon for renewals. The names on the S-10 forms in your file can be copied off and listed on subscription blanks, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">whichever the case might be. Again the same publisher obtaining the subscription, if possible, will be given the call to make. This followup activity can be centered around the company book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This latter procedure can be started immediately on subscriptions now listed on the company paign, or eight subscriptions if we are pioneers? What can we do to get more new subscriptions? First, attend all of the meetings. By attending meetings regularly, Instruction is gained on how to present the campaign offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let all publishers endeavor to have a larger part in door-to-door work during March. Those being trained in such work by other publishers have the opportunity to advance toward maturity by giving the witness and speaking at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, let us concentrate on presenting a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> with a premium of three booklets, on a contribution of $1.00. Have a greater share in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign and you will have a greater share in raising the poor out of the dust of old world Ignorance and bringing them long-needed comfort.</span></p>

(These may be ordered as campaign items.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">S-10 forms that will be expiring in the next month or two. If the name of the publisher obtaining the subscription does not appear on your old sheets, effort should be made to determine the name of the publisher obtaining the subscription. In small companies publishers will recognize their own subscriptions if given a chance to look over the S-10 forms. Also, many can be determined by comparing the list with the Bible study file. Subscriptions listed that are not in the company’s territory, such as those obtained at assemblies and those not within reasonable traveling distance need not be called upon, as these will be cared for by the expiration slips sent out by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subscriptions not renewed will be processed as usual by the Society, and the company will receive the expiration notice as heretofore. A final call can then be made, and this will provide all subscribers with the opportunity to renew or indicate definitely that there is no further interest. If this arrangement is followed out systematically a great deal of this interest can be brought to maturity.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Pioneer Publisher</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer is a publisher who devotes at least 100 hours a month, or 1,200 hours a year, to Kingdom preaching work. Privileges of pioneer work are open to company publishers who have regularly published for at least six months after their baptism. If necessary, a pioneer may engage in part-time work to provide things essential for his livelihood. (Acts 18:2,3; 20:33,34; 1 Cor. 4:12, AW) However, such work must always be viewed as secondary to his pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The primary responsibility of a pioneer is to devote his time to the preaching work, and this by regularly engaging in house-to-house, back-call, Bible study and magazine activity. He should use the current offer when witnessing, obtaining his literature through the company when at all possible. Each pioneer will direct interested persons to company meetings and endeavor to aid these and other publishers in the field service. This he can do by working in co-operation with the company’s weekly service arrangements at the Kingdom Hall and company book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to his consistent field activity and practical field experience he can be of real help to the company in its ’service arrangements and programs. By taking personal Interest In company activity and putting forth a real effort to Improve his ministry, as well as that of his fellow servants, he will be exercising understanding and maturity. Servants in the company will show appreciation for this assistance by not imposing various duties on the pioneer that may interfere with his field service work. In exercising love and showing enthusiasm for his work, the pioneer will be an example in service and godly conduct and prove to be a stimulating inspiration to the entire congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer endeavors to exercise patience and tact at all times and will work for the upbuilding and unity of the local organization. He wisely appreciates that regular attendance and oral participation at company meetings and enrollment (if a brother) In the theocratic ministry school are a real encouragement to the company publishers, and it will benefit him personally and prepare him for his dally ministry. Many opportunities and privileges are open to him to expand his ministry by accepting assignments to companies in need of pioneer assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By doing this a pioneer Is able to contribute much toward the increase and progress of a company.</span></p>

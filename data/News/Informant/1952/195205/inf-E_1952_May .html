<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> There flows forth from the established throne of the new world a crystal-clear river of water of life for the cleansing, refreshment and comfort of God-fearing persons. This “water of life&quot; is now available to all who wish to have divine favor and to eventually gain the prize of everlasting life in the coming new world of righteousness. All persons of good will are now being invited by Jehovah's witnesses to drink heartily of this life-giving water by taking in this all-essential knowledge of Jehovah and his Son.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> During May we will dispense life-giving knowledge to the general public by presenting the combination offer of the A'cir </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ilas Keltgton Done, for Mankind.’</span><span class="font3"> These will be placed on the comparatively small contribution of $2. It can be truthfully said that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Neu: World Translation</span><span class="font3"> is the clearest, most accurate and understandable translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures available. The book answers clearly the question propounded in its title. The two go well with each other; the combination is a powerful one —a veritable library;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Presentation of this combination offer will </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">require</span><span class="font3"> good preparation. It will aid greatly to familiarize ourselves with the Foreword of this translation and its many other distinctive features, as well as note the comments of noted scholars and translators. Make the offer attractive by the use of familiar scriptures, such as those in the sermon on the mount, the Kingdom promises of the mild-tempered ones’ inheriting the earth (Matt. 5:5, (&gt;; John 17:3 and others), etc. Notice how much plainer familiar scriptures are! Avoid controversial subjects by giving a Kingdom witness at every opportunity, using attractive and appealing scriptures. Present the entire “combination’' offer every time and everywhere: at the initial door-to-door contacts, on back-calls and on studies. For many other valuable points that can be used see also the December, 1951, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> When reports are fully compiled (be sure yours is in) it is hoped that a national peak in publishers will lie attained in April, 1952. Safeguard and aid to maturity new publishers by continuing to train them in doing held service and in attending meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Be regular and be on time at Sunday morning contact points. Make Sunday count, for that is when the majority of the U. S. public is to be found at home.. If possible, work in territory not covered during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign.

<p><span class="font3">The Society is now publishing the second edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God, Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font3"> This is a revised edition, some corrections having been made and new points added to bring it up to date. Readers will find that it does not read word for word with former editions. So in conducting home Bible studies in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> in the United States, it is suggested that all attending the same study use the same edition, old or new. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> was kept out of stock by the Society for a while so the companies could deplete their stocks of the old edition. The book has been reset with new type and some illustrations added. It would be well for the brothers to read this book again. In the United States and other countries where this new edition is released, the publication should be used for company book studies when they have finished </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Keligion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> A good supply of this new edition is on hand and all orders for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> will be tilled with the second edition.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>To Male Pioneers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">All brothers on the pioneer list who now have a draft classification are requested to advise the Society immediately of their Selective Service classification. This information is needed in order to complete our tiles for reference.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be a Pioneer!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">With summer vacation near at hand, publishers of all ages are once again invited to enter the vacation pioneer service. Last year over 1,250 publishers made wise use of their vacation period by entering this service. With part-time secular employment and the quota of 100 hours a month in the ministry, many more should be able to enter into this activity this year as well as into the regular pioneer service. Pioneer service is a forward step in the course of a dedicated servant of the Most High God. If you can Scripturally be a pioneer, then by all means you should become a pioneer. Think about it, seriously. If your decision is yes, the Society will be glad to receive your request for an application and will be pleased to work closely with you as you pioneer. Companies should consider this matter at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> service meeting during the month. Additional material for this discussion may be found in the April, 1951, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Witnessing in Unassigned Territory</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> It is suggested that each publisher prepare a five-minute presentation of the three-bound-book offer to be used in the summer campaign. Then let each one witness to another until all have clear, friendly and encouraging presentations. In this way we will be prepared to be real ministers, giving short sermons at the doors. Argumentation should be avoided: rather, work for sincerity. conviction, warmth and enthusiasm. This will make our witness pleasing and constructive. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom. I’uh-lishers,</span><span class="font3"> Lessons C, 7 and 20.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> One might use the following to begin his presentation: “Good morning. My name is ................ and I am</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">from ....(city or town)-..- I am one of Jehovah's witnesses, engaged in a Bible educational work. Throughout</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Youthful and Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many opposers scoff at the claim of the youthful witnesses of Jehovah to be ordained ministers. But such youthful ministers remember the apostle’s instructions, “Let no man ever look down on your youth,’’ and boldly push forward.—1 Tim. 4:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our 1952 “Yearbook” tells of one of these, a boy of 17 years, who is a special pioneer and that in a land where the Kingdom proclamation is banned, Spain. He tours the villages on his bicycle in his part-time work and at the same time distributes Bible literature and conducts Bible studies. (76) And from Colombia comes the report of a boy of 12 entering the pioneer work, conducting studies and doing well as a minister. (113)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While comparatively few of our youthful witnesses may be able to follow such examples, the Society's recommending that secular education include high school, they do have the opportunity each year to be pioneers for a few months under the vacation pioneer provision. Doubtless far more could engage in this added feature than have thus far done so. The report from the Bahamas shows that 12 per cent of the publishers there took advantage of this privilege. (85, 246) And what better way of encouraging children to vacation pioneer than by doing so ourselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And vacation pioneering is filled with benefits: increased praise to Jehovah, greater witnessing to both sheep and goats, and valuable training for the year-round full-time service and missionary field in later years. Telling of the effectiveness of the witnessing of such vacation pioneers is the report from Guadeloupe concerning five children and one adult. In spite of opposition they ‘went boldly forward and stopped the mouths of the enemy by their intelligent answers’. (69)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Isolated</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The two primary problems that witnessing in isolated territory present are those of travel and time. But the prisoners in such isolated territory must also hear the call “Go forth!” must they not? Our 1952 “Yearbook” shows how some of our brothers have coped with these problems and how the Lord has blessed their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It took a circuit servant in Basutoland two days on horseback to reach a group of interested persons. A company was organized as the result of his visit, and when he called again he found that even the local Catholic priest had heeded the call to “go forth”. (219) May we not expect similar blessings if we make similar efforts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A pioneer in Cuba tells of taking almost a whole day, traveling on horseback and by foot, to reach the relatives of the one with whom he was holding a study. In a few weeks’ time some had begun to publish, a little later 19 were immersed, “and now, where a year ago there wasn’t a single publisher, there are 35 publishers reporting active service.” (117, 118) Yes, the question of getting the isolated territory witnessed to may simply be one of our determining to what extent we are willing to inconvenience ourselves, endure a little hardship, physically and perhaps financially, so others may gain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And the report from Honduras, giving a number of interesting experiences had by missionaries who branched out into isolated territory, shows how we can find time for such activity—they did it during their vacations. If that is a good way for missionaries to spend their vacations it should be an even better way for all not so fortunate as to be in the fulltime service Right? (153, 154)</span></p>

The Bible was written before the English language existed, therefore translations are necessary. This is a new translation from the original Greek text and is based on the most ancient manuscripts in existence, and embodies the results of the latest research in the field of archaeology bearing on Bible lands, languages and customs. To ensure accuracy the translation is as literal as modern English usage permits. It mirrors faithfully just what the Lord and his apostles said.</span></p>

It is this kingdom which we have long prayed for that will make it possible for men to ‘beat their swords into plowshares' and for the meek to live on the earth. These three Bible study aids highlight the kingdom of God and are especially prepared to help all who want to get a better knowledge and understanding of the Bible.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Favorable weather in May will afford an excellent opportunity for aiding new publishers to maturity by taking them along with us in house-to-house work. They need to be shown the effectiveness of the preaching work when it is properly done. The first demonstration will emphasize sticking to the offer, while the second will demonstrate the use of the “New World Translation” (NW) and “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I: Sticking to the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1 (5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">min.) Positive assists</span><span class="font2"> Negative in house-to-house work. As they approach a rather run-down house Negative remarks: “I’ll try this one.’’ Then he says: “I’m sure these people do not have $2 for the combination. Besides, they'll get more information by reading ‘What Has Religion Done for Mankind?’ It’s so simple to understand. Then, too, it will be much easier for me to get a home Bible study started.’’ Knocks on door, presents offer. After short discussion with person who is a bit hesitant in taking combination, Negative immediately drops to the book “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?&quot; Placement is made and, after getting the householder’s name, both publishers proceed toward next borne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part 2 (3 min.) En route to next call. Positive suggests sticking to offer. Negative says: “Yes I really should hat e stuck to original offer. That person was quite interested and needed the combination &quot;&nbsp;Positive agrees, saying: “We can accomplish much more, by sticking to month’s ofter Our responsibility is not to make the &lt;&nbsp;hoice for the persons we meet or 'to try to decide what they will do in advance and thus drop down on the offer when it doesn't seem to meet with immediate approval And if people don’t have money, be willing to barter or exchange. But always allow householder to make his own decision regarding campaign literature offer we present by sticking to the combination outlined in the 'Informant’. Let's try another door ”</span></p>

I have. Will you accept this home-canned fruit in exchange for them?&quot; Positive is willing to trade and takes her -name and address for a future visit.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I: (5 min.) Conductor introduces home scene, inviting audience to listen and take notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Husband and wife discuss world affairs. Man is worried about war threat, high taxes, living cost; has fear for job. home. Wife agrees. He looks at paper, finds only scandal, bad news, more politics. Wife says he should attend church. He argues no help there. She advocates Bible reading. He agrees, but says, “thee’s&quot;. “thou’s” and other strange wording of his Bible obscures meaning, sometimes contradicts As example, he reads Matthew 6:9-13, AV. Observes King James' language is outmoded and difficult to read and more so to understand. Recalls February issue of “Look&quot; magazine gave proof that last verse of the Lord’s prayer is not authentic and that it showed other important differences. Notes churches fail to tell such things, even rover them up. What is needed is a Bible that can be understood. If only help along these lines could be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II: (10 min.) A mature and a new publisher in door-to-door work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Approach door of above home. Publishers introduce message, present offer. and are invited inside. Publisher demonstrates features. See pictures of the original Greek on page 13. Based on latest Greek scholarship and oldest MS copies, the renderings are accurate, clear. Note also the valuable chain references and appendix, which are found in no other Bible. (Example: Which Mary or Joseph is spoken of in various texts? [P. 789]) Words are translated consistently and no contradictions are to be found Proper meaning is given to verb tenses. The plain, modern language enables you to read the Christian writings as real, meaningful letters to us personally. The Scriptures become a living book, a guide to right living for the new world of righteousness. Only 15 minutes’ reading each day will give you a wonderful understanding of God’s purposes. Now question is asked, “Is there any particular scripture you want to read?&quot; “Yes. Matthew 6:9-13.&quot; NW copy is handed to man to read. Man, with wife looking on, is pleasantly surprised. Another scripture is given to read New publisher next tells of the advantages of book “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?&quot; and shows how this Bible study aid will help them. (Refers to pre-selected questions and points of interest, e.g., pages 21 and 22.) Combination is placed Arrangements made tn call back with new publisher noting name and address and promising to personally make it his business to call back. Conductor now briefly recounts main points that should be presented to public. Advises group to study “The Watchtower&quot; of October 15, 19o0.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">would like to be able to keep in touch with you as well as speak to you directly when I find occasion to return to this community. It may perhaps be possible to send you additional information when it is released and since it won't lie convenient to personally visit you regularly. may I have your name and 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our brothers throughout the field will be interested in knowing exactly what part the Watchtower radio. WBBR. is having in the preaching work. To determine this accurately a house-to-house poll was conducted January 28 to February 3, 1652, in northern New Jersey, lower New York state, including greater New York city and Long Island, and the greater part of Connecticut. There were 104 companies that participated in taking the poll. At each home visited a special WBBR program schedule was left as well as a copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wafehtou-or</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font3"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the results we can appreciate that a tremendous witness was given, because 164,562 persons were talked to in this work. Of this number 23,148 were found to be listeners, which is 14 per cent. That means that of the 151 million potential listening audience in the area it serves. WBBR has 2,170,000 listeners I It is indeed gratifying to know that so man) persons are tuning in to the varied presentations of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is grateful for the fine co-operation the companies gave in taking part in this WBBR poll. All publishers in the listening area of WBBR do not now want to stop advertising the station. We want to continue tn keep it before the people in the territory WBBR serves as the only station on earth wholly devoted to the kingdom of God. Mention it. please, in your door-to-door work. We will surely get more listeners and we want to help the prisoners to &quot;go forth”.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> A few suggestions: Make your witness thorough but not wordy. Always let the people see that you are in earnest and are interested in them. When endeavoring to obtain their names, do so with kindly interest and in a frank yet tactful manner. Let them know they will not be obligated in any way: that this is not a commercial endeavor but a sincere effort to assist lovers of truth to get a better knowledge of the Bible.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The Society is providing a letter to be used for all “not at homes”. If more than the original consignment is needed, these can be ordered. A letter is to be left at every home where personal contact is not made. If they are not all used up in the unassigned territory work, tlie letters are not to lie wasted, but should lie used wisely in our regular territory.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Utilizing Theocratic Resources and Equipment </span><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “The earth is the Loro's’’—yes, and all things in it. To his servants he grants the control of many material things and opens the way for them, in harmony with their dedication, to use such to his name’s honor and to the blessing of others. Knowing that all things belong to him, his servants have dedicated their lives and all they have to his service. In serving Jehovah they wisely and liberally employ all things—their life, lips, home, automobile. money, yes, iheir “air. —Acts 2: 44, 4.4, A H'.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Particularly is this true of the preaching work they engage in, the planting and watering work to find and feed the “other sheep”. For the benefit of God’s servants and persons of good will a Kingdom Hall is provided and maintained as a Bible study and service center. It is the privilege of all to contribute toward its upkeep as well as toward bearing other company expenses, such as equipment, heal and light, handbills, and other things required. All contributions, including the “widow’s mite&quot;, are made as to Jehovah, and are contributed toward furthering the Kingdom interests.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> To carry on the work automobiles are a great aid. Those having cars are responsible, as they have opportunity, for their use in the service work. However, considerable expense is incurred traveling to and from territories, to meetings, etc., not only for gas and oil, but also for maintenance. This cost might well be shared by those publishers who are privileged to make use of the vehicle, by contributing at least the equivalent of the bus fare. Most cars have ash trays which can well serve for this purpose. If a car owner does not wish to use contributions to defray expenses, he may place such in the Kingdom Hall contribution box. If practical, an</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Many of the preliminary arrangements, such as vacations, car groups, week-end groups, etc., should now be given consideration and planned. A good supply of literature should be on hand to take care of needs. Make the most of all opportunities to spread the Kingdom message in your assignment.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Each company and isolated publisher will receive with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> a copy of the Unassigned Territory Letter. All companies will read the letter at a service meeting and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watehtoirer</span><span class="font3"> study and then thoroughly discuss its contents at two subsequent service meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">automobile not in running shape might be put into service by a couple of brothers' supplying needed parts, or assisting with the repair work, etc. Co-operation can accomplish many things and make possible expanded service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Most pioneers who have means of transportation are very glad to use it to ]&gt;ick up publishers and take them to meetings, into service, etc. All publishers should have in mind that these brothers are rendering a loving service and the ones using such transportation should be willing to uSsi.it with (he expenses so as not to unduly burden the pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> When traveling to conventions, assemblies, unassigned territory, etc., each car group should work out a (ilan before going as to how expenses are to be handled so that car owners and passengers will all understand the arrangement. Car owners should not be required to carry all the burden, nor should riders be unreasonably taxed. A flat rate could be arranged for, or all in the group should agree to share expenses of the trip.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> These statements are submitted to aid in the joint co-operative use of our equipment to Jehovah's praise and are not to be construed as in anywise discouraging the aiding of publishers or persons of good will who are unable to contribute the designated amounts. As far as possible and practicable these should be considered and assisted in the arrangements. Wise and proper use of theocratic resources and equipment should always lie made. Paul, at 1 Timothy 6 : IS (A' II’ 1, counsels, “Be liberal, ready to share.&quot; We are clean from false religion and do not take collections, solicit or ask for contributions. Jehovah's servants recognize that expenses will be present and are willing to do what they can to use all things entrusted to them for Jehovah's honor and to their mutual blessing.</span></p></li></ul>

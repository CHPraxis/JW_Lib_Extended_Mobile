<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> This old world is crumbling I Millions are confused, panicky, desperately seeking a strong refuge of safety. From one scheme of men to another they scurry, only to find that they are like houses built on sand. Yet, in the midst of this world there rises like a strong tower the visible organization of Jehovah’s true worshipers. In it alone is safety, for Jehovah is its refuge and strength, a very present help in these troublesome times. Knowledge of God's Word is necessary in order to be in his organization and to come under his protection. Those within Jehovah's strong refuge want others to learn of this so that they too can enjoy lasting peace and comfort.—Ps. 4G: J.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> During June an attractive selection of bound books will be presented to millions of persons in unassigned and assigned territory. li'In/t </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jias Relinion Done for Mankind! “Let God lie True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and one other, on a contribution of $1.50. Make a real effort to show people what valuable information these books contain. Tracts, catalogues and the Society's letter to leave with “not at homes&quot; in unassigned territory should be carried into the field and placed in accord with instructions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The time is now here to reach territory that has not been covered with the Kingdom message for some time. Have a well-thought-out presentation before beginning work in your territory. It might carry the following thought: “Honest persons desire happiness and the end of wicked conditions. God's kingdom will bring an end to misery and introduce permanent happiness. There is a strong refuge even in the midst of this wicked old world and these books search God’s Word and point out where you will find such strength and refuge.” Give a good, clear, easy-to-understand witness. Have the three books ready to display. It is good to first show all three books together. Then you might put two of them under one arm and show the person points of interest in each book, one at a time. Open the book and hand it to the person rightside up as you directly face him and thus let him see and read for himself. Illustrate the use of the table of contents and the Scripture index in the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Company publishers who will not be working unassigned territory can accomplish a good work in their home territory. Endeavor to work sections of territory that have not been covered as frequently as others. Hold public meetings in them, and plant as much seed as possible by* placing literature. Back-calls can be made and interest cared for. Company book study groups can meet at contact points convenient to territory they will work. It does not necessarily mean going long distances to work, but simply getting into fields where the witness has not been given for some time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Honest-hearted persons everywhere have a real need for a strong refuge. We know where they can find it. Let us continue to comfort them with the assurance that “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&quot;—Ps. 46:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">132,797 Public Praisers!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">It has been done! April 1952 saw 132,797 public praisers in the field. This is the first month of the service year that we have exceeded our quota. This was not done by wishful thinking or by a few individuals' doing it all; no, but by each one of us doing his share, uniting and working in accord with the local company organization. We faced the problem called to our attention in the Society's letter to all publishers dated February 20, and, having a desire to overcome it, are now progressing toward that end. It meant, first of all. each one's getting out into the field work and then helping others to do the same. How gratifying to see all working together and having a part in this public praising!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Preparation for Summer Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The following is a portion of a letter received from a company making plans for summer activity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Several publishers and I were over mapping out our assignment and in general gathering information for our master map, and everywhere we went we found the people ready and eager for the Kingdom message. We found one good-will rancher where we can have a regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Bible study beginning June 1 and keep all our literature and supplies there as a base. The principal of the high school gave us permission to hold the circuit servant’s Sunday talk in the auditorium free of charge. Also the grangemaster said we can use a fine Grange hall free</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Effective Talks in the Theocratic Ministry School</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> So that those taking part in the theocratic ministry school may give the greatest possible help to the company in the way of interesting and instructive talks, the following suggestions are given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The instruction talk should be logical and coherent, thus easy to follow: the doctrinal points made clear and the admonition on conduct</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now we are in stride, organized ami moving forward with Jehovah's blessing being manifested upon our efforts. In the months ahead, just as during April, let us continue to exercise love, patience and consideration for each other as we progress toward maturity. We are not interested in merely having a new peak, but, rather, we desire that each and every one become a mature minister of God, able to teach and enjoy blessings in serving Jehovah regularly.—Heb. 5:12-14, A’lF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Personal instruction and assistance are still needed by many to reach maturity; so onward we will go helping one another not just to serve one or two hours a month so a report can be turned in, but to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Christians today follow the example of Paul in making use of every opportunity to give a public witness. (Acts 17:16-34) Particularly should we be alert in this regard as we work the isolated territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We may not be able to obtain a public meeting place, but what of that? A small company In Austria held a public meeting in an isolated town, where, due to clergy opposition, only four attended. Unable to procure the hall for further meetings they held the next meeting out of doors. Eighty attended that meeting.—See “Yearbook”, page 84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor should we feel that the effort will not be worth while just because we may not have much time to advertise the talk. In one isolated town in Nicaragua, two brothers had just two hours to advertise the public talk to be held in a home that evening. By the time the conclusion of the talk was given 125 were listening, the meeting having spilled over into the street. (183, 184) And for an example of results of a public meeting held in a home see report on El Salvador. (133)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor should we let opposition to our public meetings discourage us. If we press the battle to the gate we may expect the Lord to give us the victory as was the case in Costa Rica where a public meeting in a park was broken up by a priest-led mob. By not surrendering to the enemy the meeting was held the following week with police protection, and 150 heard the lecture. (114-116)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Expressing Appreciation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Added privileges of service, such as witnessing in isolated territory, usually mean added burdens and even hardships. But dare we consider these burdens too great to be borne in view of what our brothers put up with in other parts of the world?—Job 23:12; Ps. 84:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s witnesses in Thailand continue in the service during the rainy season even though, when at its height, they have to use oxcarts and small boats, walk barefoot through streets that are seas of mud and then wade knee-deep in water to reach homes. (235, 236) Working our isolated territory may also pose travel problems, muddy streets, etc., but surely that Should not discourage us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And although our brothers in Korea, due to war conditions, experience great difficulty in getting even the bare necessities of life, their chief concern, as our “Yearbook” shows, is not for the material, but for the spiritual food, so that they can continue on in the work. (71, 72) And how the Lord is blessing that appreciation! (“The Watchtower”, April 1, 1952) In caring for the isolated territory, sandwiches may have to take the place of Sunday dinners, but if we show the same appreciation that our brothers in Korea do, may we not expect similar blessings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Taiwan (Formosa) a newly interested person kept going ahead in Jehovah’s service even though mobsters had damaged his farm and stolen his farm animals because he stopped worshiping idols. (167) It may be that a like intolerance and violence will greet our activity in isolated assignments. But that should not cause us to stop preaching, for how do we know but that there are some of the Lord’s sheep scattered in among such goats?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Kingdom publishers may find the following suggestions helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A friendly, “Good morning. I’m working in the interest of true worship, acquainting the people in this community with three popular Bible aids: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">'Lei God Be True', What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Ererlasting Life’.</span><span class="font3"> This combination of three volumes is being left with persons of good will on a contribution of only $1.50. You know, there are many religions claiming to be Christian in the world today, yet we have only one Bible and one God. The real truth as to which religion is the correct one is to let God be true. This book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font3"> based on the Bible, will aid you to understand its fundamental doctrines and the basic requirements for those who want to adhere to true worship. The conclusions are not beclouded by sectarian interpretation. And so that you might have a complete picture of the numerous religious beliefs that men cling to, and their origin, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind! </span><span class="font3">has been provided.

<p><span class="font3">render praise as much as possible, engaging in the door-to-door ministry, having a part in the back-call activity, conducting Bible studies with other persons of good win, etc. Company meetings and the company book study arrangements are very important to us and to the ones that we are privileged to assist. Make it a practice to be a regular meeting attendee and to engage in all features of the service. “Let us consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, . . . but encouraging one another” from now on without letting up.—Heb. 10:23-25, A ll’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font6"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prisoners living in unassigned territory urgently need a strong refuge. They need to forsake the failing and inadequate organizations of men. Undoubtedly a number of these will respond to the call to freedom and will eventually hail the King. The following demonstrations will visibly call to our attention the urgency and details of how we can aid these persons. Companies that have no isolated assignments ;may adapt these demonstrations to apply to their unworked territory or even to unworked personal territories held by publishers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Scene I: (3 minutes) A man is talking to his wife about summer isolated territory campaign, which had been featured on company’s last service meeting. He argues he can’t see why publishers should put themselves out so much when the company can’t get around its territory more than once a year now. Also, he has worked hard all year and when vacation time comes he wants to be on his own and rest He’d like a vacation at the seashore, or to get off to himself away from people for a while. Besides, his own personal territory could stand more working, and if he wants to put in a day or two of his vacation there he can do that. Wife goes to cook supper and he falls asleep and dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Scene II: (12 minutes) Hidden voice is heard, saying, “Calling car 15. Go to 12 Maple street and pick up negligent publisher.” “Policeman’’ shows up and leads publisher to “Court of Conscience”. Publisher stands, judge appears and reads charge of ‘‘turning down Kingdom opportunities”. Publisher pleads “Not guilty”, sits in defendant’s chair; charges are made. One shows how publisher always said he would like to pioneer if he could: now he turns down chance to try it 1 or 2 weeks. Another points out how happy defendant was when a witness called on him when he lived in rural, and now he is in truth. Questions raised. Was Paul of that mind? Reads Romans 15:20, 21. What if apostles had felt that way when the governing body assigned them? (Gal. 2'7-10, Acts 22:21; 13:2-4) What if Paul had been disobedient to the heavenly vision? (Acts 16T0) Publisher says he really loves the Lord, just didn’t see the necessity of the work clearly enough. Judge finds publisher guilty, but suspends sentence on condition that he give careful heed to admonition from court. Judge gives instruction from scriptures such as Matthew 24:14 and Isaiah 52:15. Cites examples of accomplishments of missionary work from “Yearbook” (such as pp. 64, 129, 147, and 154). United States, with 1 publisher to about 1,000 population, can stand much more expansion of good news before it is thoroughly preached to: should certainly get most thorough witness. Taking vacation by doing rural work would be most enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After admonition, publisher awakes in living room. Tells wife that his conscience recalled to him all he had heard at service meeting, and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Work &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(usual rent $20), in a good loeation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We have our master map up at our Kingdom Hall on a board with room around the edges for small white cards thumbtacked with small red strings running from all principal towns, roads, Grange halls, newspapers and radio stations, schools, camp grounds, also distances from many various locations, and populations of all towns, settlements, etc. This will save lost motion and wasted efforts, gas and time. We appreciate the Society’s advice to prepare.” </span><span class="font2">they had better get a stock of books and prepare to go with company in isolated work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Scene 1: (4 minutes) Car group traveling to unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairs arranged as seats in a car. A discussion ensues. One publisher muses: I wonder what territory we will be working? Brother Foresight, car captain, tolls of previously surveying area and determining most advantageous manner of covering it. He knows just where each in group will work and briefly outlines general strategy Publisher is relieved and thankful that Brother Foresight has foresight. Another publisher is sure something has been forgotten, enumerates items. Everyone is properly equipped except Brother Diversion, who brought only blankets, swim suit, suntan lo-4ion, etc. He is tactfully informed that our first consideration should be that of witnessing in this unassigned territory and when that is done if someone wishes to swim or otherwise relax it will be all right. It may refresh some for back-calls in the evening. He accepts counsel and arranges to borrow more literature. Someone suggests that each give his presentation of offer for benefit of self and others in car. Group agrees and this is started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Scene 2: (8 minutes) At Work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One publisher calls at door to present offer but no one is home. Letter, Catalogue and two tracts are safely and securely left at door (not in mailbox). Another publisher makes a call and gives a complete witness. Real interest is found Householder takes offer. Arrangements are made and agreed upon to call back that night to demonstrate effective manner of personal home study of Bible. Name and address are obtained and reason given. Friendly departure is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Scene 3: (3 minutes) Returning home from territory late Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Same group and chair arrangement. Start discussion of week-end experiences, contacts made, studies started, public meeting arrangement and attendance, etc All, including Brother Diversion, are enthusiastic over the work accomplished and interest found and pledge further cu-operation. Brother Foresight is pleased and agrees to make future plans for the group. He drives carefully while reports and Good-will Follow-up slips are completed and Bible quizzes are carried on.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Brooklyn Bethel Vacation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s offices, factory and Bethel home will be closed from August !) to 24 inclusive for the annual vacation. Orders and correspondence sent in during that period will not be handled until some time after the reopening of tile offices. To avoid delays it will be necessary to anticipate your needs well in advance and place .tour orders in ample time for attention before the vacation period. Circuit and district servants will have their vacation during the same two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective Talks . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd) </span><span class="font3">driven home with a punch. From reports at hand, it seems that some have become hazy on what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theo-iititic Aid to Kinftdom I’ubJiftfiers </span><span class="font3">1ms to say about outlining a talk, its introduction and about coherence. It would be well, then, to review lessons 31 through 3G and 43.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In the instruction and third student talks, scriptures may be used in any order desired to gain the best coherence and exposition. It is not necessary that all the texts be used, but certainly a majority should be, and reference to scriptures not in the chain should be kept at a minimum, if used at all. In the instruction talks an appropriate title, based on the chain word, should be selected and then announced by the school servant. For example, the title “Imitating the God of Mercy” could be used for the chain word “mercy”. Particular attention should be given that the theme is maintained throughout.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> In the third student talk the theme will be stated in the form of a question propounded by the person of good will at the beginning of the discussion. This question should be clear-cut. Other relevant questions may be asked as the discussion proceeds, so as to allow for discussion of related angles of the theme. These, however, should be secondary and incidental to the theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The first and second student assignments should have an interesting but brief introduction appropriate to the material they will read. After the reading and after having given four or live good analytical points, the conclusion should revert back to the theme of the chapter and not merely be a comment upon the superiority of the translation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>b</sup> To be equipped to give helpful comments at the proper time, the audience should prepare in advance. Points of comparison in the material read should he weighty, have a vital bearing on the truth or make for a clearer' understanding of the text and not merely be use of a synonym. Marginal references and footnotes should not be neglected; they often throw much light on the understanding of a text. Comments should be brief so as to allow as many as possible to partake.

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Continue Three-Bound-Book Offer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">All nations, without exception, have failed to give God's Word the first place. As a result, today there is &quot;anguish of nations, not knowing the way out&quot;. Christendom has joined the nations and is now spotted all over with uncleanness of this corrupt world. Are any obeying Jehovah’s command as expressed at Ps. 119: 9, 1G </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(AT)■'</span><span class="font3"> Yes, His name people are. They heed God's Word and give it first place in their lives and offer others the opportunity to do the same by declaring it to all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">July offers excellent opportunities to give God's Word first place by our continuing to present three bound books on a $1.50 contribution in unassigned and home territory. The summer weather will be advantageous in working our territory and long days can be spent in this service. Rural territory is pleasant to work. New publishers will be stimulated by joining in the service. Plan outdoor public meetings on park lawns, in front yards or wherever convenient and practical.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Public Service Radio Program</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Every city that has a radio station has a potential avenue to “say to the prisoners. Go forth&quot;. It is hoped that many of these stations will be used to open the ears of many sheep in our home communities by giving them the opportunity to hear. The Society is sending to all company sort ants with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> a letter outlining the arrangement. along with script No. 1 of Things People Are Thinking Aboi t. The letter contains detailed information on program presentation, use of script, approach to radio station managers and program directors, selection of personnel. as well as general counsel. Every effort possible should be made, by the company servant or those whom he selects, to obtain this time to broadcast FREE in the company's territory the special program service provided by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company servant should select those best qualified to represent the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in this matter. If there are several radio stations in town and contacts require leaving the script for consideration, we suggest that an exact copy be made of script No. 1, neatly typewritten, for submitting to such stations for their examination. Company servants should follow through on the instructions set out in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those unable to work in unassigned territory will continue to concentrate on regular company territory that has not received due attention. Call back on placements and try to start studies. Bible studies will aid persons of good will to put God's Word first in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What place does God's Word occupy in your life? Does It take first place? Are you careful not to permit other cares and interests to snatch first place in your life? If your answer is 1’es, it shows that you recognize God’s Word as being practical for our day and certainly you will tell others about it.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Isolated Publisher</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> An isolated publisher is one who does not live in company territory and is unable to regularly associate with a company because of extreme distance. Isolated publishers are part of Jehovah's theocratic organization, sharing in its privileges and responsibilities. Therefore, the Society desires to assist them in every way possible to care for Kingdom interests in their locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Wherever practical, the Society will assign the territory in which an isolated publisher or group lives to the neaiest company, even though it may be some distance away. This arrangement is made to encourage attendance at company meetings as often as possible so they might regularly receive beneficial counsel, help and encouragement for their advancement in the ministry. If necessary, other meetings, or at least a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wutihtoirer</span><span class="font3"> study, can be established by the company for the benefit of these publishers. The company can also supply them with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> mailing it if necessary, in addition to literature and other witnessing equipment. They should be kept informed of the circuit servant's visit, the circuit assembly and other company activities. Their field service reports are to be turned in to the company. Under this arrangement, they will be taken off the isolated publisher list and will be recognized as part of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■<sup>!</sup> Where it is impractical for isolated publishers to associate with or report to a company, the Society will assist them directly, providing them with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> literature at company rates and report cards which should be mailed directly to the Society at the end of each month, and will include the combined report of others if there is a group.

<p><span class="font3">It is suggested that those who do obtain accommodations through the rooming committee accept their assigned rooms. If for any reason they are unable to attend, they should notify the landlady as soon as possible, whose address always appears on the pink assignment card. This will be for the benefit of all concerned.</span></p>

Even though they are not organized as a company, they Should have regular meetings and service arrangements. When visiting the nearest company, the circuit servant will, if possible, take a day or so to assist the isolated publishers, and make a report to the Society. He can ascertain the prospects of forming a company in that area and. if advisable, a company application with its recommendations can be sent to the Society for its consideration. The one recommended as company servant, to qualify, must have symbolized his dedication by water immersion, be able to set a proper example and be willing to carry out instructions. If no one is qualified to serve as company servant, then the group should continue the existing arrangement until a company can be organized.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Where a pioneer has developed an isolated group and believes that a company can be organized, he may fill out and submit a company application form to the Society's office. Should an isolated group feel able to function as a company, the most qualified publisher of the group may write and explain their situation to the Society’s office, request a company application form, fill it out and then return it. Pioneer help should not be requested as a condition in order to be organized into a company.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> As tlie Kingdom work continues to expand, many who are now isolated publishers will be organized into company groups, sharing the blessings of that arrangement, and contributing with greater effectiveness to the expansion of Jehovah's nork to his praise.</span></p></li></ul>

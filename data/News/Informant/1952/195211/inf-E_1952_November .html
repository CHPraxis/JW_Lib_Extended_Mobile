<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Assist Others to Gain a Good Conscience</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During the month of November publishers will endeavor to “hold a good conscience” by presenting three bound books on a contribution of $1.50: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind? “Let God. Be True” </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”. </span><span class="font4">To the majority of publishers this will mean simply transferring the offer they were making in their unassigned territory to their regular company assignment. To others who had no unassigned territory it will mean extending this very excellent presentation to a greater number of persons in their regular assignment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Regardless of whether you work in unassigned territory or regular territory you meet people, you talk to them about the Lord's kingdom, and you endeavor to place bound books with them. If you did that in unassigned territory, you can do it in your regular assignment. People, generally speaking, are the same. If you can show them that you have something they need, they will take it. Therefore, if you present the combination with the same vigor and conviction in your present assignment as you did in your unassigned territory’, they will take it, and you will place books. Actually our biggest job is that of adjusting and preparing ourselves to do what the Lord directs and in the manner he directs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In this connection the following comparison is interesting. Prior to the unassigned territory campaign we had a three-bound-book campaign in November, 1951. The average for book placements per company publisher was 1.3. In December, 1951, we offered one bound book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> Average books per publisher, 1.2. During the three-bound-book campaign in unassigned territory, we averaged in June 1.6, in July 1.5 and in August 1.4 books per company publisher. The slight decrease in placements from June to August is undoubtedly due to rapid completion of unassigned territories by many companies and their return to regular company assignments. But the figures indicate that publishers placed many more books in unassigned territory, and we believe this was mainly because the publishers went to that territory expecting to place books. They diligently and enthusiastically presented books and hence actually placed them. The combined total of 924,811 books placed in the United States in the three months proves this.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Maturity Essential for Regular Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Do You Preach Every Month?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The mature Christian understands fully his commission from God. His richness of understanding keeps the will of the Lord clearly before him and he delights to do it. Thus Paul prayed that the Colossian brothers might “be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work”.—Col. 1: 9, 10, AH'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, &quot;become full-grown in powers of understanding,” for it is then that a Christian moves forward steadily, confidently and properly equipped to preach the good news of the Kingdom. This is why we received so much good counsel on growing to maturity at our recent district assemblies. That there is a great need at present for increased maturity is shown by an examination of the figures on regularity in the service. Of the total number of publishers in the United States during the past 6 months, only 56 per cent were regular publishers each conviction, and see if we do not bring our placements up to the level of our unassigned territory results. Examine the book placements for June, July and August from your company records and ascertain your publisher average. Make it your goal to equal or exceed that figure right in home territory. Arrange demonstrations by publishers who were efficient in placing bound books. Encourage those who are having difficulty making bound-book placements. Let experienced publishers give personal assistance and generally work up enthusiasm for the presentation. Make your quota for each publisher at least two hours of house-to-house work every Sunday followed by back-calls on previous placements. Be sure each publisher has at least two combinations with which to work, and also have plenty of company supplies on hand for the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">month, while 44 per cent were irregular. This means that only a little over half the total publishers engaged in the preaching work every month, while the remainder for some reason did not arrange their affairs to engage regularly in this blessed work of aiding others. How does your company compare?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we are to reduce this number of irregular publishers considerably, it will require that each servant in the company and all mature publishers work diligently to help new and irregular publishers to participate in the service. This should be true, not for just one month, but every month. (See the September 1951 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> and the Society's letter of February 20, 1952, for suggestions.) Not only will well-planned service meetings be necessary, but personal instruction will need to be given them in the field, where they can receive helpful suggestions and tactful counsel as they work. True, we want to continue working tow-ard new peaks of publishers, but chiefly we want to care well for “the flock of God” and see that everything possible is done to ensure maturity and</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Obey God Rather than Men&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostles, when before the Sanhedrin and commanded to cease preaching the good news regarding Christ Jesus, replied: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (Acts 5:29, NW) The 1952 “Yearbook” shows that the good example they set is being followed by Jehovah’s witnesses today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witness work in a certain Syrian town was forging ahead by leaps and bounds, especially the public meeting campaign, partly due to the fact that a clergyman took his stand for the truth. So the Devil influenced his agents to command the brothers to refrain from assembling themselves together. However, they obeyed God rather than men and so the company servant was arrested. At the trial the false charges were refuted and a good witness was given, causing the judge, in dismissing the case, to say: “I have found Jehovah’s witnesses to be the only real Christians.” (170, 171)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our brothers in Switzerland followed a like course. Although the Supreme Court at Lausanne refused to properly classify their house-to-house activity as preaching and ruled that they must obtain permits, they chose to obey God rather than men and even arranged for a circuit assembly in Lausanne, where the court resided, and featured the house-to-house work. Not a single arrest was made, and the largest attendance ever was seen at the public meeting! (233)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Yugoslavia the brothers continue to preach and increase despite a five-year ban. They depend upon Jehovah for strength. (244)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One cannot read the reports contained in the 1952 “Yearbook” without being struck with the vital role that the home Bible studies play in releasing the prisoners; where “anyone who is being orally taught the word [shares] in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching”. —Gal. 6:6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Bolivia a clergyman told a young couple with whom a Bible study was being conducted that Jehovah’s witnesses were antichrists. However, having just concluded the chapter on Jesus Christ, they were well equipped to refute him. Result: two more publishers of the Theocracy. Without the home Bible study the Devil’s bird might have snatched away the seeds of Kingdom truth that had been so painstakingly planted in the hearts of those interested ones. (91)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In China one sister invited her former school friends to her own home for a Bible study, and before long there were three more witnesses for Jehovah. One of these in particular received much opposition from her husband and so-called friends, but that only made her stronger. Could she have withstood that heat of persecution without the help obtained from that Bible study? (110)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In France a back-call was made in a town where there were none of Jehovah’s witnesses This grew into a study with ten persons. “Within two months, four were publishing, and by the time of the next circuit assembly six of the original ten were immersed. At the close of the service year there were 12 publishers in that little town, and as many as 30 persons were attending the public meetings held there. Home Bible study work is certainly an effective means of obeying Jesus’ injunction, ‘Feed my sheep.’ ” (137) And also an effective way of telling the prisoners, “Go forth!”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>To Those Who Say, “I Have My Bible”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When this expression is heard from the lips of a householder, a well-equipped Kingdom publisher can tactfully reply: “Most people in this country have a Bible. In fact, it is very rare </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to come to</span><span class="font4"> a home that does not have one. However, is merely having a Bible in the home helping people to live as Christians today? I’m sure that you will agree conditions throughout the world are as described at 2 Timothy 3:1-5. (Paraphrase) Every day newspapers and radio broadcasts relate the multitude of unchristian things being done by people who have a copy of the Bible. So just having a Bible is not enough, as we both know. It must be read, understood and its righteous principles put into practice. These publications which I am offering to you on a small contribution have helped me immeasurably in understanding the Bible. I gladly bring them to your door and feel sure that you, too, will receive a blessing by reading them witli your Bible. Take this one for example . . .” (Go on to tell how it aids in studying the Bible.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is another way to tactfully bring out the importance of having Bible study aids: “I’m glad to know that you have a Bible in your home,</span></p>

The cost of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> is 50c per copy, and calendars may be had for 25c each or five or more to one address for 20c each.

Pioneers on the list before July 1, 1952, should register now with the stock servant of the company with which they are associated in order to receive a free copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> The stock servant will keep this list and take it into consideration when ordering the company supply of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook;</span><span class="font4"> and he will check off the names of the pioneers as he gives out copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> Pioneers who commenced work on or after July 1, 1952, will not be eligible for a free copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> Those pioneers not associated with a company will receive their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font4">direct from the Society if they are because it is the finest book ever published. There is no question about that in either of our minds, for it is a provision from God, as stated at 2 Peter 1:21. (Paraphrase) Many of us, though, have trouble understanding and getting the full benefit of what the Bible says. In fact, we might liken ourselves to the Ethiopian eunuch whom Acts 8 tells us about. He was returning from Jerusalem where he had gone to worship. As he rode along in his chariot, he was reading aloud from the Scriptures when Philip, one of God's ministers, came to him and asked if he understood what he was reading. The eunuch replied that he did not fully understand and that he would need a guide or someone to help him to do so. Today, too, we need Bible study guides to assist us in a study of the Bible. Many millions of these publications (have offer in hand) have acted as a guide for people all over the world, aiding them to understand clearly things </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> vital concern in worshiping God.

<p><span class="font4">We are now in a new service year, which means that we will work toward our new quota of 139,289 publishers. Publishers should compare their progress with quotas established by the company.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Some publishers devote a great deal of time to street work, but little if any time to house-to-house preaching. The greatest results are achieved by a balanced field schedule. In October many &quot;Awake!” subscriptions were obtained in house-to-house witnessing. The second demonstration below</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">offers suggestions on how to follow</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conductor opens with remarks about door-to-door work’s being' backbone of our service to God. Not enough door-to-door work is being done by publishers. Last year in the U.S. 19J million hours spent in field, 9 million pieces of literature placed, plus 11 million magazines. Roughly this amounts to one book, Bible, booklet or magazine placed every hour, the great majority being booklets and magazines. But why not increase book placements? Are we not educators? And do not books provide basis for more studies? Many hours of street work are good, no doubt; but most effective use of time requires us to channel more activity into house-to-house work. This will increase our placement average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 1 </span><span class="font2">(3 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">mm.) </span><span class="font2">Two brothers talking. Brother Progressive tries to encourage Brother Backward to do house-to-house work with him. Campaign this month is to place as many bound books as possible in hands of people. Backward says secular work allows him only two or three hours a week, and his street work at Main and Broadway seems to tire him less. Progressive tries to get him to put in one hour in house-to-house work, but to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (6 min.) </span><span class="font2">Progressive calls at a door. Householder says: &quot;I have seen a Watchtower man standing on corner of Main and Broadway.’’ Witness: ‘ Yes, it is one way we have of reaching many busy people.” Householder: ‘‘It doesn’t seem that many stop to talk to him, but I suppose every religion has a different way of preaching.” Witness: &quot;That's just one small feature of our preaching. But may I step in for a few minutes to explain how you have come into contact with the greatest educational work ever undertaken?” Progressive is invited in, leads into three-book offer, showing how they aid in study. Places books; arranges for return visit. (This scene can demonstrate effective presentation of three books.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (3 min.) </span><span class="font2">Two brothers again meet and Progressive’s experience is recounted. Brother Backward is impressed. Progressive shows how doing only street work is onesided. Street work good<sub>t</sub> yes, but think of greater opportunities offered in house-to-house work. God gives real increase when we talk to people, when we give of ourselves to people by explaining his purposes, when we participate In all features of service. Why not put half of his street time in house-to-house publishing? He invites Brother Backward on back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE IV (4 </span><span class="font2">min.) Householder glad to see Brother Backward. Says he did not appreciate work he saw on street until Brother Progressive talked to him and showed him it was only part of great educational campaign of Jehovah’s witnesses. Systematic arrangement of books, questions, etc., convinces him we are real Bible educators. Study is arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conductor concludes, showing Brother Backward that he should now think very, very hard. How much more Progressive accomplishes with his time! If you are a street publisher only, why not give some of that time to house-to-house work for better results?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">through on &quot;Awake!” subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Awake!” Follow Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (4 min.) </span><span class="font2">Bible study servant working with company book study group on back-call night has made arrangements to assist irregular publisher in back-call work. Two discuss call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bible study servant outlines steps that will make return visit productive. A well-planned back-call can easily be the springboard to a home Bible study. He sets scene by recalling points that induced person to subscribe for &quot;Awake!” His personal record shows world unrest, religious disunity, fear and political strife were touched on in original discussion. He recalls that householder subscribed because &quot;Awake!” truthfully exposed those responsible for world distress and then provided Bible solution. Next he checks equipment: Bible, bound books, magazines and handbills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (8 min.) </span><span class="font2">Bible study servant and irregular publisher at the door of &quot;Awake!&quot; subscriber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bible study servant warmly and in friendly, spirit introduces himself and irregular publisher to householder. He identifies himself as minister who stopped by a short while ago, is recognized and both are invited into the home. Bible study servant explains purpose of call is to be certain that copies of &quot;Awake!” are being received, and that he is especially interested in householder’s observations and opinions on magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Householder remarks that he looked over several articles that were interesting. He questions the conclusions of &quot;Awake!” relative to the end of the world. Servant points out necessity of having complete picture of any subject before drawing conclusions or closing mind to something that is not easily understood. In all fairness it would be well to examine authority and references &quot;Awake!” relies on. The Bible is produced and Bible study servant sets householder’s mind at ease, stating that &quot;Awake!” does not condemn world on its own premise, but allows Word of God to do judging. He refers to Daniel 2:44, Ecclesiastes 1:4, Isaiah 45:12, 18, and Revelation 16:14-16 to show that destruction of world does not mean end of literal earth, but rather end of wicked system of things and its supporters. As discussion continues, he takes out &quot;Let God Be True” and demonstrates how book searches out scriptures on given subject. He refers to &quot;The End of the World”, chapter 21, and continues discussion with material in this chapter. After an hour discussion is ' brought to pleasant conclusion, Bible study servant mentions that he would like to return next week to take up a few additional points on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (3 min.) Bible study serv</span><span class="font2">ant discusses the successful back-call with irregular publisher. Advises him to be prepared with a subject in event subscriber does not raise one. Points out that he intends to place “Let God Be True” with subscriber on next week’s call and then work right into study. He tells advantages of sharing in this work regularly. Irregular publisher voices appreciation and expresses desire to improve his ministry in this way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>A United Petition for The World Assembly</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.” (Ps. 127:1) This Scriptural principle applies to all activities of the Lord’s people in caring for Kingdom matters. Having in mind this fact and the world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses to be held in New York city July 19-2G, 1953, properly it may be said, ‘Unless the Lord’s blessing and favor is upon the multitude of things to be done in connection with preparing the world assembly, they labor in vain that build it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each one of the Lord's people is deeply concerned in the assembly and desires it to be an outstanding milestone this side of Armageddon. The Society prayerfully considers all assembly arrangements before Jehovah and will continue to do so, as counseled at Philippians 4:6 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(NW) :</span><span class="font4"> “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” Knowing that Jehovah delights in the petition of his devoted people everywhere, the Society is inviting all dedicated individuals and companies of Jehovah's witnesses world-wide to unite with us in praying for Jehovah’s guidance upon all undertakings in this regard.—Prov. 15 : 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With prayers ascending to Jehovah from all parts of the world in behalf of the assembly itself, our personal arrangements to attend as well as those of our brothers throughout the world, undoubtedly he will be pleased with our united petition and pour out from heaven a manifestation of approval that will result in the greatest of blessing to all of his people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Society has a quantity of the not-at-home letters left over from the unassigned territory work. A limited supply of these will be sent with each company order until they are gone, and publishers may use them in regular witnessing. This is a splendid letter to leave where people are not at home when you call. Be sure you do not put them in mailboxes, however, as this is contrary to postal regulations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Letters to the Society should be as brief as possible, yet clearly written, with the opening paragraph stating the purpose of the letter. Should the letter relate to previous correspondence, mention this in the opening paragraph, giving the desk symbol and date of the previous correspondence, such as CD October 2, 1952. If a postcard was sent to you by the Society which deals with the subject of your letter, return the card with your letter. The writer should always sign his full name at the close of the letter, not just initials. Do not take it for granted that someone at the Society’s office knows you. The company servant should sign all letters from the company, and his signature should certify that he has checked the correspondence and found it correct. Every letter should bear a return address; and company letters should bear the full name of the company and unit (where units exist), such as New York, N.Y., Company, Brooklyn Heights Unit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In order for clean worship to be triumphant, we must grasp the privilege given us of instructing others, that they also may share and enjoy such worship. In working with these three books, let us be ever mindful of our obligation to call back and lovingly help the people study and appreciate what “the form of worship that is clean” requires of them. Pioneers and company publishers alike should call back on all book placements made in November and December. Keep in mind, too, that right conduct is an integral part of our congregational meetings. Show goodwill persons clean worship in action by inviting them to the company meetings. With friendliness and love give them a taste of what it means to associate with those who put clean worship first in their lives.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The company book study constitutes a group of brothers assembled for Bible study, using one of the Society’s books as an aid. It is supervised by the local company organization and presided over by a Society-appointed study conductor. The study can also serve as a field activity center at which service meeting admonition and suggestions are put into practice with the assistance and leadership of the study conductor. The company book study follows the organizational pattern set up by Moses over Israel, so proper attention can be given to the individual, both in study and application.—Ex. 18 : 22-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The progress of the company as a whole is dependent upon the efficient operation of its company book studies. The greatest portion of responsibility falls upon the study conductor. Personal planning and preparation together with zeal and enthusiasm in performance of his duties will bring the desired results. His comments during the study will be brief and he will endeavor to keep the theme of the lesson outstanding. Brief service announcements, such as invitations to Kingdom Hall meetings and service arrangements for the local group during the week, will bring the meeting to a close. The entire meeting will not exceed one hour.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Due consideration should be given to all present and especially to the Fellowship with those of clean minds and hearts makes our grip on the word of life more firm, and it will likewise be a stimulus to those of good will.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Regularity in service helps us maintain clean worship, too. Be determined to be a regular publisher, thus keeping your heart and mind on the triumph of clean worship.</span></p></li></ul>

All present who can read should be given opportunity to read scriptures not quoted in the paragraphs. Only the better readers should be assigned to read the paragraph sum-ups, one reader per evening. He should be notified a week in advance. The alert conductor will be cognizant of those needing assistance in the field service and will show himself anxious to render personal help. A good conductor will inspire others to action by his own enthusiasm and willingness to render aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The importance of the company book study cannot be too strongly emphasized. Through these area studies the Lord has kept his organization intact when the enemy has outlawed the work and closed the Kingdom Halls. Therefore, all publishers should co-operate fully by being regular in attendance and having lessons well prepared. The publisher in whose home the study is held is greatly blessed and should keep the home neat, clean and free from disturbances during the time of meeting. Some have felt it necessary’ to serve refreshments after the study. This is oftentimes a burden on the householder and therefore none should expect it. Feeding spiritual food and helping others to say “come” is our chief aim. Doing so in a spirit of warm friendliness will guarantee Jehovah’s approval.</span></p>

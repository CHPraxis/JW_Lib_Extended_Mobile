<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> What is your greatest desire? Is it to be an honor and praise to Jehovah’s name? To prove yourself worthy of the name that you bear? To share with others life-giving knowledge that has been shared with you? To give God first place in your life by heeding and living his Word? (Ps. 119:9, 16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font3"> Nearly one-half million of the earth’s inhabitants today </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">can and do</span><span class="font3"> answer Yes. And you are one of them. You believe God's Word, have full confidence in it. have arranged the affairs in your life so that it has first place and you enjoy publishing its message for the blessing of others. What a grand desire to have and to put into practice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Groups having unassigned territory should give proper attention to working it. Interest found should be properly noted and names of good-will persons sent to the Society following each week’s activity, as instructed. Time for working special territory is limited. Make your time count. Get an early start witnessing in the territory and spend many hours in active service. Thoroughly and systematically cover the assignment. Give a friendly, helpful witness to all that you meet.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Christ Jesus instructed that the things told as if whispered regarding the Kingdom and its blessings should be amplified and preached from the housetops for the benefit of the world. Modern-day witnesses are very busy in this regard and the whole world is being reached with the good news of Jehovah's kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> All the facilities at their command are used in this proclamation and it is interesting to observe how the magazines are used extensively in getting the message of the Kingdom to the people. Each year a Not-at-homes are to be left two tracts, a catalogue and the special letter stating that one of Jehovah's witnesses has called. It may be possible in some cases to make a return call at these homes before leaving the territory. Many who were not at home will have returned and examined what you left them. Interesting calls will result, and it will make for thorough territory coverage. Back-calls, too, can be made wherever possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Groups working in regular company-assigned territory will diligently endeavor to serve sections that have not been witnessed to for some time. Make </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">your time count </span><span class="font3">here too. Meet by 9: 30 a.m. at the contact point Sunday, discuss the daily text, try some friendly presentations and then go right out into field work. After spending at least two hours in door-to-door work presenting the offer, why not spend an hour or so making back-calls? Most publishers will be working near or in territory covered the preceding week. It is an opportune time to call back on previous placements. Also, some not-at-homes may be called on. and probably on these return calls many of the householders will be found at home. Then, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font3"> 2, col. 2) four-month </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watektoiver</span><span class="font3"> campaign is conducted and it is thrilling to see the great number of new subscriptions received from the field as well as the enormous number of distributors' copies that go out to be distributed individually by the publishers from house to house and on the streets. Notice the results of the past three campaigns as reported by the witnesses in the United States:</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Tracts Ideal</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>for Incidental Preaching</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Reports and experiences indicate excellent results have been obtained in using tracts in incidental preaching. Tracts not only open the way to a Kingdom witness but make way for back-calls, Bible studies and getting people to attend company meetings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> One report relates that while a publisher was engaged in magazine route work the occasion arose to make a back-call. At the home where the back-call was being made a guest was present who was fed up with all kinds of religion and was under the impression that the “Jehovah people” were just another branch of false religion. Being in a hurry she could not allow the publisher time to explain what Jehovah’s witnesses believe or the purpose of their work. However, the publisher was alert to the situation and offered the guest some tracts to read later. Getting the address of the guest from the householder the publisher called at the guest’s home and was warmly received. Had the tracts been read? Yes; and now this newly interested person asked for some additional tracts so that they could be sent to her son in the armed forces. Unable to contain herself over the newly found truths, she began to talk to her close friends and was able to arouse the interest of one of her neighbors. She arranged to make a call on this neighbor and asked the publisher to go along. The three ended up studying the tract “What Do Jehovah's Witnesses Believe?” After a thorough discussion of this tract to the satisfaction of all, the publisher introduced a bound book and a study was started in earnest. Within a few weeks’ time both the guest and her neighbor were attending company meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Misinformed persons are given a good opportunity to appreciate the truth when it is presented to them through the tracts. By using a tract, one witness was able to remove the suspicions of a housekeeper by answering her questions as to whether or not Jehovah’s witnesses were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From House to House</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Going from house to house is a basic theocratic activity. How can we say to the prisoners “Go forth’’’ unless we first find them, and what better way is there of finding them than going from house to house? —Acts 5:42; 20:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In going from house to house do we always make sure to see that every home receives a witness? In Australia, as shown by our 1952 “Yearbook”, because a publisher went back to witness to a home previously missed, one of the Lord’s other sheep, though physically deaf, heard the good news of the Kingdom and took his stand. Now he is helping others to hear spiritually while he confidently looks forward to receiving his physical sense of hearing in the new world. (81)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And while attending assemblies let us not neglect the house-to-house activity. In the Saar, as a result of house-to-house activity during a circuit assembly interest was found at a home; which, being followed up soon, became a home Bible study with ten taking part. By the time the next assembly came around, six months later, six of these were immersed. (139)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We may be engaged in the house-to-house activity, witnessing to one householder after another without finding any interest and still it may be that appreciative ears are listening. That is what one Guatemalan publisher experienced: no interest at the doors but much interest on the part of construction workers on the street who had overheard his preaching. (148) Yes, house-to-house activity brings results. Are you engaging in it regularly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Buying Out the Opportune Time”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Ephesians 5:16 (NW) the apostle Faul counsels us to 'buy out the opportune time for ourselves because the days are wicked’. Surely never before have the days been so wicked as now nor has the need to buy out the opportune time on the part of God’s servants been as urgent as in this pre-Armageddon era with the eternal destiny of so many at stake. —Ezek. 3:17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A good way to buy out the opportune time is by witnessing while traveling. The missionaries sent to Ethiopia found the first few months there rather difficult. Then one day as one of them was walking along a road he accosted an Ethiopian youth and witnessed to him. The young man showed keen interest and he, together with his friend, were the first native Ethiopians to become publishers. Before long one of them had 20 attending his home Bible studies. (66) Missionaries in Liberia had a very similar experience. (73)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A circuit servant in Finland made good use of the long delay incident to changing trains on his way to a circuit assembly by arranging for a public lecture. A young woman who heard the lecture was convinced of the truth, journeyed to the assembly city and was baptized at the assembly. (135)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In British Guiana a lone publisher will often place from 40 to 50 magazines in just a few hours of witnessing while traveling by boat or train. (94) If all would be thus alert to buy out the opportune time how much greater would be the witness given and how our average hours would increase!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>With the Three-Bound-Book Offer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">How would you present three bound books to the people that say they already have a lot to read? Something like this might be used:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“True, no doubt you do have much reading material, but the books I have here are not like newspapers containing only current events and that pass out of date very quickly. These books are permanent reference works and w'ill furnish many hours of contented reading in the months ahead. You can quickly get the Bible’s answer to many of your questions simply by turning to the indexes in these books. For example, you might wonder about the scripture at 2 Corinthians 4: 4 (A'U’) regarding ‘the god of this system of things’. Turning to the scripture index in this book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Gott Be True’, </span><span class="font3">it refers you to four different pages where it discusses Satan the Devil. Note one reference tells about Satan’s offering all the kingdoms of the world to Christ if he would do an act of worship toward him. (Refer to other pages.) Thus you get a clear understanding of the scripture that tells about ‘the god of this system of things’: and it answers many other Bible questions. You see. the book identifies Satan and tells you who he is, why he exists and how he works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“These three books give information on subjects that are of the highest importance and concern to you. We are leaving all three on a contribution of just $1.50. They cover subjects dealing with everlasting life, true and false religion and basic Bible doctrines. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’</span><span class="font3"> explains in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Giving God’s . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font3">of course, after a good day well spent in field work, do not neglect to meet together for the public talk and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, bringing persons of good will toward the Lord to the meetings with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Whether working assigned or unassigned territory continue using the wholesome three-book offer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> and the third one can be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> or any other bound book. Take the entire offer out of your witnessing case when you make your initial presentation. Let them know as soon as possible that a contribution of only $1.50 is all that is required to obtain these three detail the formula for successful living. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> treats the major religions from the time when there was only one true religion down to this day when there are many religions and gods. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’ </span><span class="font3">reviews God's purposes and shows how he has been true to his word recorded centuries ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then: “Did you say you think your religion has a different understanding? You know, when people want to settle a difference of opinion about the pronunciation or meaning of some word, they go to the dictionary because they recognize the dictionary as an authority. Well, the Bible is an authority like a dictionary when it concerns such vital things as our way of living and our religion. These books have been published to give the Bible’s authoritative answers to many puzzling questions about life and world conditions. They let the Scriptures interpret themselves and leave ideas and traditions of men out. Also, these publications are a bulwark against communism because they fill the need for true religious education today. Taking in knowledge is an essential requirement for everlasting life, just as John 17:3 shows. Sincerity alone is not meeting God’s requirements, because many heathen persons are sincere in what they believe but they do not have accurate knowledge of God. You’ll find wonderful knowledge in these three books. As I said at the beginning of our discussion, you may have these three bound books for only a $1.50 contribution.” (See the June 1, 1952, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine for more suggestions on effective preaching when objections arise.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bible aids. Demonstrate briefly the benefits of each book by directing attention to particular features and pointing out that 83 complete subjects are treated in the entire set, with almost 1,000 pages of informative and detailed research material compiled. Try various ways of presenting the offer, note points that seem effective and let your presentation be governed accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> God’s Word should have first place in our lives always. Study it, live it, and share it with others so that they too may come to have a desire similar to yours, namely, to be an honor and praise to Jehovah’s name as they give God’s Word first place in their lives and walk the way that leads to everlasting life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">• In order that we may be able to give God’s Word the first place in our lives personal organization is necessary. The following demonstrations are designed to portray the effect personal organization has on our house-to-house preaching and our success as Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (7 minutes) Car group arrives at unassigned territory. Proper personal preparation is evident as the car captain dispatches the group into the field. He assigns each a portion of territory. He checks to see that everyone has a good supply of all necessary equipment. He mentions the suggestion in the “Informant” to put in a good day of house-to-house work and to make every effort to place literature during this special work. After the territory assignment has been fully covered and time permits, a portion of the day should be set aside to call back on those who have taken literature, manifested interest, or were not at home, to talk to these persons and study with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A new publisher is with them and one of the mature publishers suggests that he accompany him to a few doors. The two then make a call and demonstrate how to present the offer effectively. Now the mature publisher asks the new publisher if he would like to make a call alone. He does, and each goes to a different house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (3 minutes) Later in the day the new publisher hints that it is time to stop. The other calls to mind the Society’s suggestion to spend a portion of their day calling back on those persons who took literature previously. He explains that some who ■were not home earlier may have returned from church and can be contacted, also this form of service provides variety and increases time spent in service. The brother invites the new publisher to accompany him to make a call on a man with whom he could place only a magazine the last time. The two agree to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (5 minutes) Call is made on the person where placement was made. The man is pleasant and invites them in. He says that he read the magazine and liked the clear presentation of Biblical subjects. He adds that he has always believed there was something to the Bible but now through this publication he realizes its value. He cannot understand, however, why so many people ignore it. The brother hands him a copy of “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” and suggests they turn to page 26. They begin to read and look up supporting scriptures as they read along. The question is answered clearly and successfully and then the three books are presented and arrangements are made for a back-call. As they walk away the new publisher remarks how quickly the time went and perhaps more calls can be made after the public meeting. [Companies having no unassigned territory and those that have publishers working in home territory can adapt portions to fit needs, such as doing house-to-house work for two hours and then devoting one hour or so to calling back on literature placements or not-at-homes.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Necessity of Personal Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (5 minutes) Brother opens with short talk on “What Makes a Good Pioneer?” Why is it some under practically the same circumstances do not pioneer? The extent of personal organization as a company publisher often determines whether one will see necessity of pioneering, and if so, be successful and stay in pioneer work, or even be a good company publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then he as commentator introduces a pantomime. It is after service meeting. A brother is wishing to go in isolated territory work this week end, but hasn’t arranged to go with a car group regularly, is running around trying to find a place in a car. He will be without equipment when the week end arrives. Another, prepared as far as transportation is concerned, is making further preparation by getting supply of proper literature, letters, tracts, etc., at stockroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I! (5 minutes) A week elapses; the two are talking. “Unorganized” says he’s not going -with same group next week end, for he didn’t place any literature. “Organized” says he has some calls and will have to go back. With this and the interest in his territory at home he can’t find time enough to get the work done. He has been taking more and more time from other things for the service, but about the only way he can do justice to it is to start pioneering. He speaks of things “The Watchtower” has said about vital importance of organizing ourselves for new world living. It has never given us unnecessary admonition. (Short, pithy statements from issues of “The Watchtower” such as March 15, 1952, may be repeated.) “Unorganized” asks to go next week with “Organized” for training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (5 minutes) Returning from work, they pause in the market place of a small town. “Unorganized” speaks of experiences had and record of several good-will names. “Organized” says he is constantly mindful of fact we must organize ourselves, not only for our own good, but also for the good of the many persons who are in darkness and seeking the way of life. While speaking, they overhear a discussion about Jehovah’s witnesses. They get the advantage of opinions expressed, and hear how our sincerity, tactfulness, zeal and desire to get our new world message to the people impress them—how .people take careful note of the way we do the work, whether organized, efficient, or unorganized; reception is influenced much by our actions. “Unorganized” then expresses appreciation of experience and says although he can’t pioneer at this time, he is sure he will now make a better company publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If conductor desires, he may round off demonstration with short conclusion about being better organized publishers, company or pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Circuit servants will speak on the subject “The Truth-Where to Find It” on and after September 2, 1952. On and after September 30 the public talk “Where Is This World Heading?” will be given at circuit assemblies by the district servant. Please order handbills accordingly.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Splendid activity was carried on in many parts of the earth among the various language-speaking peoples as is seen in the fact that 3,085 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> were obtained in the Italian language and 23,394 subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> were obtained in the Spanish language. This is a very healthy Increase in these particular languages and indicates that the brothers in the lands where these languages are spoken have done good work. Space does not permit listing a complete report from all 121 lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> We know the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines contain essential and strengthening messages. We should continue to do our part by getting these publications into the hands of the people. Follow up the placements, too, and thus keep watering the planted seeds. Be magazine-minded throughout the entire year and take advantage of the provisions of Magazine Day and also distribute them in other ways. Get a regular supply each week from your advertising servant and make house-to-house distribution of them a regular part of your weekly service schedule. In door-to-door work where larger offers cannot be placed, it is good to place single copies of the magazines. Encourage persons who show Interest and on back-calls and Bible studies to subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Also, about six weeks before expiration date, call back on those from whom you received a subscription and try to get a renewal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Those who are sharing in effective magazine work are enjoying good results and are helping others to get the needed spiritual food in these days. It is sincerely hoped that many more publishers will regularly engage in magazine distribution. It is an excellent and effective means of amplifying and expanding the Kingdom witness.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">Not one worldly nation can release the prisoners or produce for its people true happiness, peace, contentment and everlasting life. Jehovah’s servants know that the entire world is in bondage and gladly put forth every effort possible to aid the righteous-hearted to get out from under the worldly yokes. This is shown in that they unitedly support and pray for the only hope, as the Son of man did when he said, “Let your kingdom come.” God's ministers realize the importance of the Kingdom arrangement and they rejoice because Jehovah</span></p>

Her objections and mental barriers were erased by the simple yet forceful argument contained in the tract. She obtained one of the bound books and wanted a Bible of her own, because she desired to make a real study of it in her home. Now, even the intimidations of her church friends as well as that of her former minister cannot sway her from her determined course to know more of Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Publishers, take the initiative to “preach the word” and have your daily ministry abound with similar experiences. Carry the tracts with you and be alert to use them on all appropriate occasions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During August we will aid those in captivity, whether in unassigned or home territory, by continuing to present the same offer on a contribution of $1.50. This is the last month of the three-bound-book campaign. Let us put forth a diligent effort to increase our personal literature placements as well as to follow through on all promises. Follow up these placements by making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies in our territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports indicate that many fail to turn in their field service time each month. Publishers should turn in a service report at least once a week, not waiting for the last day</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Kingdom Hall</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom Hall is a place for worship. There Bible study and other Kingdom activity are carried on to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name. It is the place to become built up spiritually by regularly taking in the “food at the proper time” and by association with others of like precious faith. The Kingdom Hall may also be used for the wedding ceremony and the funeral service. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">of June 15, 1952, pages 355-363 and 366.) Arrangements should be made through the company committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Since the Kingdom Hall is rightly the most important structure in the community, the building’s appearance should be a real credit to the Lord’s organization. The display window should be kept neat and attractive and changed regularly. A “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses” sign should be in a prominent place. Also, the different meetings and the times of each should be posted for the benefit of good-will persons in the neighborhood. The Kingdom Hall should also have a place to receive mail.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Proper decorum should reign in the Kingdom Hall at all times. (1 Cor. 14: 33, 40, 23-25) Adults and children are to conduct themselves in a manner befitting the occasions of true worship. Anything distracting to others or interfering with your own undivided attention, such as whispering, chewing gum, eating, making unnecessary trips to the rest rooms, coming in late for meetings, etc., is to be avoided. Servants and attendants should be aware of these facts and take the offending adults and parents individually into their confidence and of the month before doing so. Company book study conductors can assist by having a supply of field reports at the company book study. A gentle reminder and a few words of encouragement to the publishers will be much appreciated. It might be well for the company servant to allow the publishers to examine their own Publisher’s Record cards periodically, two or three times a year. This will aid them to see just what they are doing and to improve their personal service of praise. Active publishers could be assigned to aid the irregular by working with them regularly in all forms of service. Show your faith and hope in the Lord’s prayer by continually supporting all theocratic arrangements, diligently working to help others to share in the blessings of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">ask their co-operation and then see that order is maintained. Counteract the loose behavior of young brothers by seeking their aid in controlling the behavior of other children. An alert attendant force can do much to establish and maintain proper decorum.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> A company must decide for itself whether it prefers to rent, buy or build a Kingdom Hail. Usually it is more convenient to rent than to own one. However, any company that is planning to buy property for a Kingdom Hall or contemplates building one should first write to the .Society for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum on Kingdom Halls</span><span class="font3"> which covers the legal, financial and related aspects of this matter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> All have the privilege and responsibility of financially and otherwise contributing to the needs and maintenance of the Kingdom Hall. A local arrangement should exist so that all publishers may have a regular turn cleaning the hall. Larger companies may work this through the company book study arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> A spirit of warmth and friendliness should at all times prevail within the Lord's organization. It is the responsibility of each one to make himself known to others present and to promote love. Practice this in the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>

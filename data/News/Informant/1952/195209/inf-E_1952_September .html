<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> It is delightful to experience the change in thinking from the ways of this old world to those of the new system of things. New world thoughts are healthful and upbuilding. Adopting such thinking and actively putting it into daily practice will result in gaining God's approval and eventually everlasting life. So put into practice new world thinking by aiding others to ’quit fashioning their minds after this system of tilings’ anil helping them to become transformed by ‘making their minds over’.—Rom. 12:2, .V1V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The first step to take in making one’s mind over is to learn Jehovah’s “pure language”. And what better aids for learning the “pure language” could a person have than the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind,!</span><span class="font4"> This superb Bible and the study help will be offered during September on a $2 contribution.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> With the work in unassigned territory completed (except where some can still engage in it and the territory is still open), all will be working once again in their regular company territory. Use the same good organization in caring for your home territory that was employed m unassigned territory. Since this month opens up a new service year, it is essential to have proper organization of all our service activities to get off to a good start.

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1953-54 Field Service Chart</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Each company is now being sent a new company- chart for the 1953-54 service years, starting with September 1952. Included is an instruction sheet. The assistant company- servant should study this carefully- and immediately post the necessary- information, such as the monthly averages for last year and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Year Begins</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">hours of door-to-door work and then follow this with an hour of making back-calls. Plan your day’s service, and start early. Keep a record of names and addresses of persons with whom you leave literature and call back with the objective of starting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> There is indeed a definite place for organization in the activities of servants in the companies. Results in our new service year will be very gratifying if the servants take the lead, and all publishers work in harmony with company arrangements. Therefore, servants, organize local activity and avoid such negative thinking as, ‘These suggestions just won’t work in our company.” Think positively and progressively to get the assigned work done. Bear in mind that overseers have a vital part in helping the brothers ‘make their minds over&quot; for better thinking and greater service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Through the company book study most of us have had the opportunity to study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Reliltion Done for Mankind!</span><span class="font4"> Being familiar with its contents we are in position not only to effectively present it but also to start studies in it. While material in this book may not be as familiar to us as that of other books, it does contain information Jehovah has prepared for those who love him. So use it effectively. Talks based on one or two chapters of the book will be well received by newly-interested persons and publishers alike. The talks, approximately 45 minutes in length, can be given at company- book-study centers, one such talk being given each month</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Informant Supply</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Supplying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> involves cost for postage, cost for paper and cost for printing time. In order to effect economy insofar as possible the Society is requesting each company- servant to review the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> needs of the company as of September 1, 1952. Please advise us as of that date how many copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3) </span><span class="font4">with the regular study- being carried on during the other weeks. The company servant and school servant can plan and arrange how the material is to be systematically- covered in this manner.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> September, then, provides everyone with opportunities to show to all men that we have made our minds over by- our unselfish efforts for new world interests. Aid the mild-tempered ones to also be transformed by making their minds over and you will experience real blessings from Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Main Event of 1953</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>—A World Assembly—</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">As the July 15, 1952, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">containing information on the world assembly to be held in New York city during the summer of 1953 was being run on rhe presses at the Brooklyn factory, publishers in two separate circuits within New York city- were assembled and enjoying their semiannual circuit assemblies. How surprised and thrilled they-were when Brother Knorr made the unexpected announcement of a world assembly to be held at Yankee Stadium in 1953. With one accord all in attendance joyously welcomed the news and expressed themselves as willing and desirous of undertaking the great amount of work required in preparing for the many features of this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When will work start? It has already begun. Initial contracts have been signed, agreements made and many other essential matters cared for. Also, individual publishers in the New York area from now on will have in mind your coming here and. along with regular Kingdom service, will make preparations for you to come and enjoy- this spiritual feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, the brothers in New York city are preparing for your visit. And, in turn, they know that you are planning and preparing to be here with the Lord's people for this grand world assembly. So from now on, Think on it! Plan for it! and when the time comes, be here for the main event of 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer and Missionary Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In reply to Peter’s question. “Look’ we have left all things and followed you: what actually will there he for us?” Jesus gave the assurance that all who followed such a course would be amply rewarded and that even in this present life they would receive a hundredfold. That Jehovah God in our day makes good this promise of his Son to all who engage in the fulltime service is very apparent as we read the 1952 “Yearbook’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During our subscription campaigns company publishers do not average one subscription in two months; but a pioneer in Bolivia in a two-month “Awake!” subscription campaign obtained 210 subscriptions’ And whereas company publishers average but a half study each, this pioneer had so many studies that he could not take care of them all but had to turn some of them over to others who did not have any. And what feature of the service is more enjoyable than conducting a home Bible study? (91)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A missionary in Ethiopia reported that “it is a strange and wonderful experience to have . . . people coming to the missionary home every day requesting that someone study with them”. Some days as many as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">20 </span><span class="font3">come, walking as much as two hours to get there and many want to study two or three hours at a time.(66)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Gilead district servants in Nigeria travel by plane, car, truck, canoe, bicycle and often, like* Jesus, by foot Reports one “On Saturday morning about 50 men, women and children followed me around to record with their own eyes the unbelievable sight of a white man preaching the gospel in their homes through an interpreter.” For one meeting 1,000 came, although advertised only by the advertising servant going around the streets at five o’clock in the morning announcing the lecture by means of a trumpet! (185)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Being Faithful in That Which Is Least</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not all can serve as pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries or at some Bethel home. And some may not even have much time for the regular features of field service. But the least we can do is to be faithful in using the opportunities that come our way to give the witness.—Luke 16:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two energetic publishers in the Sudan, Africa, make many opportunities for themselves to witness at their place of business simply by discussing the truth before they transact their business. As a result a company has been formed and some former Moslems are now conducting Bible studies with other Moslems (130)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of our brothers in Nyasaland who are fishermen likewise put the preaching of the good news ahead of selling their fish. Customers are spreading the news of how they got their fish and what was said on the lake shore by the witnesses. (196)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only at places of business but also at home one can show faithfulness </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in that</span><span class="font3"> which is least. A sister in Ecuador makes good use of the patio of the apartment house where she lives to give the witness. The women folk gather there to knit, sew, weave and talk, and so she joins them with a supply of socks needing mending, booklets and a Bible. By being alert and tactful she has been able to start five home Bible studies, with the prospect of two or three more. (127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our own circumstances may not be exactly like any of the foregoing, but if we are desirous of being faithful in that which is least we will find opportunities to witness at our home or place of business.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">&quot;I was in the area so I thought that I would stop by to see If you had a chance to read any of the Bible and the book that I left with you last week.'’ Many a back-call is introduced with a remark similar to this and, on being advised in many instances that the publication left has not been read, the publisher sometimes finds it difficult to start a constructive discussion about the publications. Are there more effective ways to start a back-call? Yes, there are 1 The following method has proved to lie successful:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After a few general remarks such as “Hello&quot;, “Good evening,&quot; etc.: “I'm very glad to find you at home, Mr. Smith. The interest that you showed in obtaining the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font4"> prompted me to stop by this evening. When leaving them with you I did not have an opportunity to point out the numerous advantages they provide for personal Bi ide study. So, if you would get them now, it would be a pleasure to show you a number of things that will help you a great deal in using them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“You will undoubtedly agree that worshiping God is important. But more than just any worship is required : for, opening your </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World, Translation</span><span class="font4"> to James 1:26, 27, it says: (read). Now note the ’c' following the word 'worship' in the 27th verse. The ‘c’ refers you to the footnote and there is given the Latin word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">religio</span><span class="font4"> from which comes our present-day term religion.

<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>1953 Pioneer Requirements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">September begins a new service year; therefore all pioneers should start to plan and organize their service schedule to meet the 1953 yearly service requirements of 1,200 hours for regulars and 1,600 for specials. The Society feels that, in view of the low hour requirements, it will not be necessary for pioneers to request time off for travel to the world assembly if they properly schedule their time now and build up a surplus before the assembly. refer to the subject index. Under the subject ‘Religion’ the section discussing the meaning is listed, pages 8-10. Turning to page 8. note the question on the bottom of the page: ‘From what comes the word religion, and how has it been defined?<sup>-</sup> Would you like fo read that paragraph?&quot; After reading: &quot;Note how that paragraph helps us to understand where the term religion originated and also to know the different meanings attached to it. Then the next paragraph brings to our attention how it is used in the Bible. The question on paragraph 4 is ‘How do the Christians Paul and James apply the word religion?' (Comment, after reading, that Paul shows it can be properly used to describe false religion as well as the true religion, as at James 1: 27, A ll'.) That brings us to the text that we first discussed. doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Then, too, Bible texts on which you desire information can be found in this book by simply turning to the scripture index. Let's look up James 1: 20, 27 and see where it refers us. Yes, page !&gt;, the paragraph we just discussed. So you see, using your Bible with its many fine aids to understanding is important. The book serves its purpose by providing explanation of the Bible texts and may be referred to for particular quick reference by using the subject index or scripture index. The questions at the bottom of the page help us to get the main points.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If time and circumstances permit, continue your discussion a short while longer by going to the 5th paragraph of the book and considering it. If not, then encourage householder to continue reading from that point and try to make arrangements to call by again next week to discuss additional points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have been vacation pioneers and who are free to continue in the regular pioneer ministry are urged to do so. Plan to attend the convention as a full-time praiser of Jehovah God. You who have not tasted of this wonderful service should examine its benefits and then make arrangements to share in this exceptional privilege. With all eyes focused on the New Y<sup>T</sup>ork convention next summer, let's all show appreciation of Jehovah's expression of undeserved kindness by doing everything we can to maintain the high standards of the pioneer service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7"> MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyday use of the “New World Translation” familiarizes publishers with valuable features of this Bible and makes for more effective incidental preaching. When persons are unable to obtain a Bible-and-book offer for lack of money, make definite arrangements to call back and deliver the literature. Have in mind the possibility of starting a Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyday Use of the “New World Translation” </span><span class="font3">(20 minutes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conductor states a full day in the life of a theocratic family will be shown in various scenes. (1) Family at breakfast table support discussion of daily text with quotations from “NW”. (2) Father, at lunch time, reading “NW” is asked by fellow workman what he is reading, father shows Romans 10'9, engages in discussion of terms “believe” and “confess” (as in “AV”), and how “NW” makes clearer with “exercise faith” and “publicly declare”. Verses 11-15 also discussed; lunch time ends and arrangement is made to call at workman’s home. (3) Mother, at home, turns conversation with salesman at door to today’s times, picks up “NW”, handily placed near door, reads 2 Timothy 3.1-5; Matthew 24 3, arouses interest and places “NW” and “What Has Religion Done for Mankind<sup>9</sup>” (4) Son at school has “NW” with schoolbooks; teacher asks what he has been doing during summer vacation; he answers, “Ministry work.” She doesn’t see how he can be a minister; he reads from “NW” at 1 Timothy 4:12, 15, 16. Teacher looks through Bible, likes its clear language, asks where she can get one. (5) Daughter, a pioneer, at a door, has experience. She says to woman at house, “I am calling with a view to advance of pure worship.” Woman: “1 already have a religion.” Daughter<sup>1</sup> “Yes, most everyone has, but there is something else Jesus tells us to do in connection with it; I would like to read his words on this from his sermon on the mount.” (Reads Matthew 6:33, “NW”.) Then she shows how more real practice of true worship, study and application, is needed. She discusses Jesus’ words further, at Matthew 6:31-34, as to how most everyone today seeks material things. Then she shows the book “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” chapter 27, par. 2-4, and ties it in with these thoughts, presenting offer and placing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(6) At home in evening, all are talking of experiences, and father speaks of good field service points in this month's readings in ministry school; he has some to bring out in a service meeting talk on “NW” next week. He asks family to listen, see what they think of them for use in field presentation of “NW”: (2 Thessalonians 2:1, 2, showing invisible presence of Christ; 1 Timothy 1: 4, “family trees” of no value; 1 Timothy 1:12, God through Christ empowers, assigns ministers, not man; 1 Timothy 3:1, “overseer”, not “bishop”; 2 Timothy 2:2, in support of theocratic training at meetings such as we have; other points may be used ) Then father remembers, too, that he is chairman of the public meeting on Sunday, and wants to include in his final announce</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Breaking up discussion and leaving living room to eat supper, family remarks that by taking “NW” with them and using it in every possible way, a great shout of praise to Jehovah’s name will go forth in September by the use of this powerful instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I </span><span class="font3">(5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">min.): </span><span class="font3">Publisher is at a door presenting the “New World Translation” and “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publisher highlights some outstanding points of offer and informs householder that the combination can be obtained on a $2 contribution. Householder remarks he would like to take the offer, but just doesn’t have sufficient money on hand at the moment. Publisher suggests calling back later at a more convenient time when householder will be able to contribute for the offer. The householder agrees to this and promises to take literature then. Name and address of householder is taken down and a definite date is set to call back with literature. If something comes up so householder will not be home, publisher suggests the money be left with someone else at the home in order to make sure he gets the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (10 min.): </span><span class="font3">Publisher calls back at appointed time for delivery of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publisher informs householder he came to deliver the literature as previously arranged. Householder expresses appreciation for this. Advises he did set aside money for literature, which he produces. As publisher accepts contribution, he takes the opportunity to give a further witness by asking the householder if he may step in for a few moments to show him the best method of studying the book. Upon being invited in, publisher opens the book to page 164. He asks householder to do the same with his copy. He asks the study question at the bottom of the page. Householder does not know answer, but shows interest, so publisher points out answer in first paragraph and then sums up the matter by reading the paragraph. Then several paragraphs are taken up the same way, after which publisher briefly reviews benefits of discussion together and suggests he return the following week at a designated time to aid householder further in a study of the book with use nf the “New World Translation”. Householder approves of the idea and says he will be looking forward to return visit for regular Bible study. (Note: Delivery call should not be counted as a back-call unless a witness is also given.)</span></p>

Be sure the figures you start with at the top of the chart are properly placed so that the monthly postings below will line up evenly in the various columns. The figures should be accurately aligned, thus giving the chart a very neat appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When companies or units are divided during the year, the method of setting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a new</span><span class="font4"> quota of publishers will follow the procedure outlined for “New Companies&quot; in the chart instructions. The number of publishers for the first month's report plus 10 per cent of that figure will give the new quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as the company report is compiled each month it should be posted on the chart. An analysis of the chart on a service meeting each month will enable the brothers to see their progress, as well as discover weaknesses that need attention in order to maintain a balanced field program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each publisher should make a personal comparison of his field report with what the company as a whole is doing. If he is weak where the company is also weak, then he should strive to improve that feature of the service, thus helping himself and the company activity. Jehovah blesses planned effort of his servants to push the advance of true worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah charges those who are servants to ‘shepherd the flock of God, becoming examples to the flock'. This means taking the lead in adequately promoting the preaching work and earing for the spiritual needs of the Lord's sheep.

<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Service Meeting</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Lively, enthusiastic service meetings are a vital necessity to a healthy, active company. They help the Lord’s people to learn the most practical and effective ways of carrying out the commission to “make disciples of people of all the nations&quot;. The company servant is responsible for planning successful service meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon receipt of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> he should outline the service meetings for the month. All </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> articles should be considered during the month. Whenever possible the article dealing with work for the current month on the front page should be considered at the first service meeting in the month. The article appearing on the back of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> considering activity of the following month is to be considered at the last service meeting of the current month. Other articles may be worked into the program in accord with the local company's arrangements. The company servant should look for and encourage other servants to offer suggestions in planning meetings, but the company servant makes the final choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Scriptural theme </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or a</span><span class="font4"> particular objective should be determined for each meeting. The first meeting in the month could have the monthly text as a theme and subsequent meetings other appropriate themes. Often the daily text can be woven in as a theme for the meeting. After the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> material is apportioned, the company servant, aware of the local problems or needs, should schedule portions on the program that will offer helpful suggestions to remedy the weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are a variety of mediums of</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Magazine Bound Volumes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Those companies and individual brothers who wish to have bound copies of tiie 1953 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> should place their orders now to ensure delivery. Individuals should order through companies where possible so that they may be shipped with company literature. This will save time and money. The cost per volume is $2.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Field Service Report</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In order that this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font4">might be mailed before the Bethel vacation and thus be received by companies in good time for use during September, the August field service report is omitted. Field reports for both August and September will appear in the October </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">education which can be used to present service-meeting material. After a warm welcome to the strangers and consideration of the daily text, the program one week might start with some form of audience participation, such as by the ques-tion-and-answer method or a panel of experts (servants) with questions from the audience. This will serve to quicken the minds of the audience. This can be followed with a demonstration, perhaps a pantomime, a round-table discussion, an interview, a quiz, a forum, a dialogue or a talk. Large companies can assign demonstrations to a group attending an area book study. A well-rounded conclusion will stir the brothers to action in the field service. Participants must watch timing closely. Appropriate field service announcements will be made at the end of the service meeting and the program for next week announced so that the publishers can prepare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tire company servant should continually strive for variety in planning the service meeting program, making it lively and interesting, keeping in mind the spiritual and field service needs of the congregation. Brothers who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah and have the ability may be used in developing such educational meetings. Service meetings that are instructive will be had if everyone will co-operate and assist by preparing diligently for these meetings. The service meeting is a provision from the Lord to aid us in carrying out our divine commission. Support your service meeting by regularly attending, participating and doing your part by accepting assignments given to you by the company servant and preparing them well.</span></p>

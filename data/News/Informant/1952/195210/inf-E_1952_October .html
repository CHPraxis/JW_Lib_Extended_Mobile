<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has set his King Christ Jesus upon his throne. As he rules ‘in the midst of his enemies’, the blessings of his enthronement become manifest to his faithful and obedient subjects. The servant class is organized for world-wide ministry, and the King has entrusted Kingdom-service Interests on earth into the hands of his “faithful and discreet slave”. “Princes” are to rule justly and work unitedly and in harmony with the “Prince of Peace”. —Isa. 32:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> By now every Kingdom publisher should be well organized for an intensive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> campaign. We will offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> to the “prisoners”, along with a three-booklet premium, on a contribution of $1. Working as a united body, we will strive to increase the circulation of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> to well over 1,000,000 copies per issue. Therefore, everyone should present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> having It on his mind and lips at every opportunity. To reach this goal we will have to increase our efforts by properly organizing ourselves, and by getting started the first day of the campaign.</span></p></li>

Therefore, we shall have to put forth our best ministerial efforts to go beyond last year’s total and to surpass the high figure for 1950. If we were able to Increase our subscriptions in 1949 and 1950, there is no reason why we cannot now exceed the 1950 campaign totals. By co-operating with the servants and being subscription conscious we can make this the best </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> campaign yet.</span></p>

(Store-to-store work can be done on another day if advisable.) Housewives and others who are able to arrange their affairs to do so will also find weekdays an excellent time to engage in house-to-house magazine distribution. Street witnessing should still be arranged; but, far from limiting our magazine distribution to this alone, we should combine it with actual preaching from house to house, which is more effective. We must talk to the people, and we can do this by going from house to house with magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">azine to others we should be thoroughly convinced of its merits ourselves. This can easily be done by being sure to always read our personal subscription copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Share </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> with your friends, relatives, neighbors, and business associates and encourage them to subscribe. Then, too, join in the organized field activity outlined by your company. House-to-house witnessing provides the best avenue for new subscriptions; but be ready to take subscriptions in the store-to-store work, on magazine routes, on back-calls and home Bible studies too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Servants, plan stimulating meetings. Utilize experiences of those who have obtained subscriptions, develop effective demonstrations. It might be well to use territory that has not been previously worked with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Each publisher should strive for at least one subscription, while pioneers should obtain at least four during the campaign. And do not forget to call back and stimulate the interest found. Let us work with one another in unity as we endeavor to make this the greatest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign to date. Our sincere efforts will assure us permanent blessings under Jehovah’s arrangement of the princes’ just rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> One of our alms as mature ministers is to make as many new contacts as we can in publishing the good news. On the streets we serve as a public testimony, keeping </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> before the people by calling oflt slogans, approaching strangers in a friendly way with an invitation to read the magazines, and placing and discussing magazines with those who have come to appreciate the journals. This is good. But think of how many more personal contacts and placements we will make if we spend an equal amount of time each Magazine Day in visiting the people at their homes with the magazines. It would be splendid to more than match our time spent on street corners with time spent in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Wisdom Crieth Aloud In the Street’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Go forth!” must also be said on the streets, especially since that is the only place where many of the prisoners can be reached. (Prov. 1:20-23, AS) The very fact that misguided religious zealots become so incensed when they see us engaged in this feature of the work should help us to appreciate its Importance. For example, in the British West Indies such fanatics have jerked the magazines out of the publishers’ hands and have torn them up and then thrown them into the streets. How one such fanatic fared in the hands of the law is told in our “Yearbook” on page 101.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By continuing in this work regularly we not only help those who are opposed to mark themselves for destruction but we also help those of good will to mark themselves for salvation. In Pakistan, where the Moslem religion has such a strong hold on the people, a government official, after watching a publisher on the street for two years, summoned up enough courage to ask him for a home Bible study. Another Moslem, after being witnessed to on the street, called at the Kingdom Hall expressing the desire to know more. (199)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To properly help the people to mark themselves for or against the Theocracy by means of the street work we must do more than merely stand mute with the magazines in hand, or mechanically call out the slogans. We must make it a point to speak to the people individually and then follow through. One publisher in Rangoon, Burma, inquired of a person: “Have you ever read the ‘Watchtower’ magazine?” Receiving an affirmative reply, he was able to place a magazine and obtain the address of the interested one. Following up this placement resulted in five taking their stand for the Theocracy. (104-105)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘The First Love’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah foretold that his people would be volunteer servants in the day of his power. He also foretold that in this day ten men would take hold of the skirt of him who is a real Jew and say, 'Come, let us go with you.’ Time and again the zeal of the new interest shames those who have been acquainted with the truth for some time. (Heb. 10:32-34; Rev. 2:4, NW) Telling of this zeal of the newly interested ones are the following experiences taken from the 1952 “Yearbook”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A publisher in El Salvador moved to an isolated spot and went to sleep as far as the service was concerned. He was found by the most zealous of the new publishers recently baptized, who told him: “If you were only saying one word a day, that would be something, but you are not doing anything; you’re dead.” While perhaps not the most tactful thing to say, it did succeed in waking up the sleeping one, who is now publishing regularly. (133, 134)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report from Singapore tells of the eagerness of a young Chinese whose family is Buddhist. He soon began to witness and in six months joined the pioneer in the field service, impressed with the “urgency of the work due to the nearness of Armageddon”. He already has been instrumental in others’ taking their stand, one of whom joined him in vacation witnessing. The two of them are conducting six studies and have already started two others in the service. (214) Are we manifesting a like zeal?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The following are some excuses you will encounter and some suggested replies you can give as you endeavor to obtain subscriptions for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the person who says, “I have my own religious magazines,” you might say something to this effect: “You know, of course, there are hundreds of different religious beliefs and that hundreds of different religious magazines are read by the people. And yet, if you would closely examine all of those hundreds of religious magazines you would find that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is one of the very few magazines that points out the Bible hope of all people, which is God’s kingdom. It is the only magazine that informs us of outstanding happenings throughout the world and shows how such events are fulfillments of Bible prophecy. We learn that we are now living In the last days of this corrupt old world, which will soon be replaced with God’s new world of righteousness. To put your hope and trust in this doomed old world would mean to risk the loss of your life. Therefore, you owe it to yourself to keep informed and awake to facts that will affect your eternal welfare. Your dollar for a year’s subscrip</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Expand Magazine . . . </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">calling at homes with the magazines. Undoubtedly our individual magazine placements would greatly increase, probably more than double.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Distribution of magazines from house to house is an excellent way to start new publishers in field service. It starts them on the road to maturity, for it gives them an opportunity to express themselves as they talk to people about the magazines and about the Kingdom message generally. It is simple, yet effective. Moreover, the very fact that even a new publisher can place a number of magazines without difficulty in house-to-house work is highly encouraging to him; and he can be aided to maturity by regular participation in magazine work at the homes. From this point it is only a small step to train the new pubtion will prove to be a wise Investment.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">To the person who says, “I have too many magazines already,” you might use this approach: “Without question you probably do have too many magazines. But, among all the magazines you get, do you have what you would consider the best magazine? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> stands ready to prove its superiority over other magazines. Unlike many other magazines it is not limited to one type of information, but it combines the features of many magazines by giving you an up-to-date coverage from all fields of knowledge. Outstandingly, it is not a commercial magazine. but is compiled, produced and distributed on a nonprofit basis. Having no commercial advertisers, it is therefore unfettered in what it prints. And, most important, it is published in the interests of upholding the truth of God’s Word the Bible, serving as a channel of information that reveals not only what is happening today throughout the earth, but also serves to warn the people, in the light of Bible prophecy, of what is coming and what steps are necessary to ensure protection and safety. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> will prove to be superior to other magazines in many ways. A subscription for one year is only $1.” lisher to offer the subscription, three bound books, etc., during regular Sunday witnessing. With his initial training in house-to-house magazine work he will more easily progress to the larger literature offers, and hence more rapidly become mature in presenting the good news.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Magazines are at present serving more effectively than booklets, so we should concentrate on placing this current material in the hands of the people. Have you tried offering a single copy for five cents when the regular campaign offer could not be placed? Why not take extra copies with you? Never let your magazines become old or accumulate at home or in the Kingdom Hall. Place them in the field and follow them up with back-calls and home Bible studies. Do your part to serve the spiritual food prepared for distribution to nourish the hungry sheep of the Lord.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Awake!&quot; will prove most effective when the stimulated thinking it provokes is followed up by publishers who are alert to start home Bible studies. Pioneers, who devote the greater portion of their time to Kingdom service, can place more magazines and conduct more studies. Why not strive for more pioneers?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 1 (5 </span><span class="font3">min.) Publisher calls at door, presents “Awake!&quot; Opens with friendly remark, then includes following: journal fills real need in these times; need help to make intelligent decisions today; do not want to be one-sided, but rounded out by truthful, upbuilding information; inspires hope, giving reasons and remedies. Publisher makes reference to specific article to illustrate what he means, and concludes by stating cost of subscription. Man shows interest in one particular article and takes subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE 2 (4 min.) Fast-moving pantomime follows: Mailman shown delivering “Awake!&quot; for year. Two different members of family look at each issue as months go by, expressing surprise, interest, amazement, indignation, shock, etc. Commentator mentions titles of articles they see that produce above results in them. On certain Issues commentator points to outstanding articles that show wide coverage, vital need of magazine. One member of family begins to conclude there is no use putting trust in commerce, politics and religions of this world. Wonders whether there is anything worth while in the world; begins to “sigh and cry&quot;, lamenting trouble and wishing things were better. Expresses idea that there is no real hope for suffering mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE 3 (6 min.) Commentator points out that in previous scene benefit of having “Awake!” was lost. It stimulated thinking processes to appreciate futility of old world schemes and remedies, but element of hope was not strongly injected. No source of hope and reliance was pointed out to subscriber. In Scene 3 publisher is shown making back-call on subscriber three weeks after taking subscription. After briefly discussing an article of interest with subscriber, he focuses attention on “Your Word Is Truth&quot;. Using the “Your Word Is Truth&quot; article in the August 8 issue for example (this section in other issues may be used), he points out that man’s only reliance is in God; that man must maintain contact with God through prayer. Publisher has formulated question on each paragraph of the article, which he propounds to arouse interest. Then he shows how article answers the questions. Scriptures in article are read, and subscriber expresses appreciation of publisher’s comments. Thus study is started, which may later be switched to bound book. Publisher leaves, with few friendly remarks, stating that he will call again. Conductor makes brief sum-up, showing we are helping “Awake!&quot; fulfill its important purpose by getting subscriptions from door to door, on back-calls and even during casual witnessing, but that we help a great deal more if we use “Awake!&quot; as a steppingstone to start Bible studies in a bound book or in “The Watchtower”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 1 (6 min.) Discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Serving God is man’s greatest privilege. The more service rendered, the greater our privilege and joy. A servant (or pioneer) and two publishers discuss the advantages of and great need for more pioneers. Sound admonition is found at Ephesians 5:15, 16 during this time of the end when the Devil, like a roaring lion, is out to devour all he can. Just look at the great increase in public praisers; wouldn’t you like to have a greater share in this increase? You can, by pioneering! </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font3"> Cor. 9:6) The abundance of local territory in the company is mentioned in harmony with figures on the recent circuit servant’s report. The sheep are there to be found, but the territory is not being worked adequately. More workers are needed. But from where will they come? Can we expect others to come in and work territory for which we are responsible? Do other companies have too many pioneers? No! Then we must fill the need from right within our own ranks of company publishers. The need throughout the world is for more pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2 (4</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> min.) Experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers will express their joys of service and many rich blessings by relating some of the experiences they are having in this full-time work. If there are no pioneers associated with the company or if local experiences are lacking for this part of the demonstration. pioneers from nearby companies may be requested to participate in this meeting or, if necessary, pioneer experiences from the “Yearbook&quot; (pages 117, 118 and 153, 154. etc.) may be enthusiastically presented by local publishers. This as well as the entire demonstration should be prepared and practiced before presentation to the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 3 (5 min.) How to do it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consider the material and ideas presented in the “Informant” for October, 1950, December, 1951, and August, 1952. Show what some pioneers are doing to engage in pioneer service, or what some company publishers might do to get into this service. Why cannot vacation pioneers continue? Can we expect others to pioneer when we, who could pioneer, are not doing so? Hardly!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“What a wonderful assembly; the best ever I” “What a grand spiritual feast!” “Surely this is an evidence of the Lord’s spirit made manifest upon the assemblage of his people.” “We thank Jehovah for all of his goodness to us.” These and many similar expressions were made recently at the 1952 district assemblies in grateful appreciation to Jehovah and his organization for the preparation and execution of these inspiring assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, we have good reason to be grateful. Just review the timely instruction and counsel that we received. Maturity, consistency in the King’s service and increased activity were stressed in the stirring talks delivered by the brothers. The clear presentation of the practicability and the advantages of pioneering show it to be a wise investment of our time and effort. Our responsibility before Jehovah as servants and publishers to maintain a blameless ministry and promote maturity was clearly outlined. The demonstrations and experiences were enjoyed very much and a great deal of benefit and encouragement were derived therefrom. It was thrilling to hear from Brothers Knorr and Franz as well as the other special representatives from the Society’s headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The high point of the assemblies was Sunday’s public address, “World Unity—Is It Just a Dream?” The combined attendance of the 35 district assemblies in the United States was 133,751. This is a tremendous increase to compare with 93,305 for the district assemblies in 1951. Also, 2,534 persons symbolized by water immersion the dedication of their lives to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, with our minds braced for activity, let us push ahead “always having plenty to do” in the service of the King, proclaiming that world unity is not just a dream, but will soon be an established reality by theocratic direction.</span></p>

It requires continual action in the work of bearing His name and confessing Him with our lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Realizing the importance of showing love to our neighbor, during November we will hold a good conscience by confidently presenting three bound books, on a contribution of $1.50. Many were successful in placing the offer during the summer campaign and will continue to have placement privileges as field work is engaged in during this month. We know that these publications are a</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Conscience”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">rich storehouse of life-producing food. We must have their contents well in mind when speaking to the people at the doors. Then, talk to them confidently with freedom from fear, presenting the message with the sincerity and conviction that bring God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Positive thinking is essential. Maturity demands the ability to convince others that the knowledge and information in these publications are for their eternal welfare. Hence, endeavor to give a thorough witness at each home. Stick to the offer, and do not be quick to drop to one book. Mature publishers can easily work with three books. Have at least two sets of books with you in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah surely blesses the works of his people, but the effort must first be there on the part of each individual publisher. Our only safe course, then, is to seek Jehovah, and participate in the work outlined by the “faithful and discreet slave” during November by presenting the three bound books to all who will hear. We will thus hold a clean and good conscience toward God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Unassigned Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">A number of companies have expressed their desire to follow up interest found in unassigned territory. Perhaps other companies will wish to do the same. If it is convenient to do this without unduly interfering with regular company activity, please write the Society for the assignment. We remind you to send a report on the extent to which isolated territory was worked. Include with this report any information you believe will be helpful to the Society in further caring for the interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness there is going to be a world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1953 at New York city, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘I am going to he there’.</span><span class="font5"> Positive thinking? Yes, it is. And that is just the way Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide are thinking about this assembly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> But positive thinking alone is not sufficient. A positive course of action is also required. Just as “faith without works is dead” so would it be on our part to think or say ‘I’ll be. there’ and then do nothing toward making it a reality by starting immediately to arrange our affairs to that end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Very evidently it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s will that an assembly be held in New York city next summer, so the “faithful and discreet slave” is obediently directing its activity accordingly. Our view, then, will not only be ‘if the Lord wills I’ll be there’; but, rather, ‘since it is the Lord’s will to have an assembly for his people (and I am one of his people), I am going to be there.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Individually we will be privileged to attend if we prayerfully consider the matter before Jehovah and then put our positive ‘I am going to be there’ efforts into operation. Start now to organize and plan so you will be in New York city to enjoy this provision of Jehovah with the rest of our brothers at the world assembly.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Theocratic Ministry School</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Just nine years ago Kingdom publishers went from door to door with testimony cards and phonographs to do their “talking”. When the theocratic ministry school was organized, publishers were on the way to maturity by learning to actually talk the “pure language”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It behooves all Kingdom publishers to continue on advancing toward maturity; hence the Society urges all brothers, young and old, to enroll in the school. Sisters, while not enrolled, are encouraged to participate in the audience discussion as outlined in the school instruction sheet. A copy of this form should be given to each newly enrolled student; and the school servant may, at the same time, suggest that he obtain for his personal use copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> When the school servant calls the roll at the beginning of school, all publishers, especially those enrolled, should be present to get full benefit from the meeting. Attendance records, along with completed counsel sheets, should be' filed by the school servant, as, from time to time, information relative to a certain student’s attendance and progress may be desired.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> By looking upon assignments as a privilege, students will always accept them gladly, not reluctantly. Brothers receiving instruction talks have an added privilege and responsibility; for, of all talks, this one must be arousing, must be animated, and must clearly accentuate a theme. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Before</span><span class="font5"> school convenes the speaker should notify the school servant of the title he has chosen for the instruction talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Preparation is the key to progress. It will greatly diminish audience fear, instill confidence, enkindle enthusiasm, and enable a speaker to put his heart into the message. A speaker who does not prepare well will not make progress, and his lack of preparation deprives him of much valuable training. Remember too, insufficient preparation not only deprives speaker or student of full benefit from the school, but it also deprives the entire company of the full blessing of the course. Speakers thus have a responsibility toward others as well as themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> If all publishers come on time, are well prepared, listen closely to counsel offered, and then endeavor to apply suggestions for improvement of their own ministry, the greatest progress toward maturity will be made. Yes, the ministry school is accomplishing its purpose by training Jehovah’s servants to actually speak the good news “publicly and from house to house”. Are you getting the full benefit from it?</span></p></li></ul>

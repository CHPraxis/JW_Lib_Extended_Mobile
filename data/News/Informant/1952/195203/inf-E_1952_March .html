<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">March Opens Final Half of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Has 10 Per Cent Publisher Increase Been Attained Thus Far?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Thousands of persons are sighing and crying about the abominations that are being committed daily. To whom can these persons turn for comfort and hope? An almost six-thousand-year record of failure rules out political, commercial and false religious leaders. But Jehovah is the great, unfailing God of comfort and it is to him that a great crowd of persons are now turning in hope, as his servants continue to publish uplift and comfort for the poor.—-Ps. 113: 7, 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> During March, God’s servants will continue to publish uplift and comfort by presenting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> from door to door. Company publishers, have you obtained at least one new subscription during the past two </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">months?</span><span class="font5"> Pioneers, did you reach your two-month quota of eight? All will want to at least meet the campaign quota, or possibly exceed it during the next two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Know your magazine when placing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> at the doors. Be acquainted with the contents and use the various features and subjects to stimulate interest in it. The index in the December 15 issue for 1951 can also be used to pbint out the many interesting and enlightening subjects treated by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> during the past year. Presenting more than one issue will readily show the variety of subjects covered. Let us always present the campaign offer and not adopt the negative attitude: “Well, they won't take </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> anyway,” and thus refrain from presenting it at the doors. Do not be responsible for withholding its message from anyone. Offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> at every opportunity. We need not give up at the first objection. Tactfully endeavor to overcome such objection, unless circumstances obviously make it impossible. Do not be hasty to drop down in your offer, but give the householder sufficient opportunity to appreciate the value of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> If unable to obtain a subscription, two different issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> may be offered on a contribution of 10c. Then make back-calls on all subscription and magazine placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 Per Cent Publisher Increase</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> March marks the end of the first half of the service year. Has your company reached the 10 per cent increase in average number of publishers over the previous year’s average? How many months have you held that increase? Have you averaged a 10 per cent increase, not only for one month, but for every month so far in the first half of this service year? What will the last half of the service year period bring? A 10 per cent increase in meeting attendance can be a big factor in attaining a 10 per cent publisher increase. Attendance at meetings furnishes an excellent basis for one to get knowledge, strength, courage and faith that will feed and build up the mind for active service. And with more publishers being service-minded there is certain to be increased field activity. “Each one help another” to become regular in service and in attending all meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The need of a comforting message grows with each passing day in this trouble-filled world. Many must yet hear God’s message of comfort and hope. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> magazine contains this vital information. Therefore, we who have been comforted by this message should now publish uplift and comfort for poor ones who are yet prisoners in this abominable system of things.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Convention Reports</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has a small quantity of convention reports that cover the Clean Worship assembly held in Wembley Stadium, London, 1951, and Theocracy's Increase convention in New York city, 1950. Orders will be filled as long as the supply lasts. Remit with order; they are 50 cents for the London report and 15 cents for the New York report.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Personal Letter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Along with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> the Society is sending a personal letter for each publisher associated with the company. The company servant will see that each one receives his copy. Twenty to thirty minutes should be spent at two early service meetings to thoroughly analyze the contents of this letter.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Summer Campaign Preparation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">In that all applications for unassigned territory were to be submitted by February 1, assignments will be sent to companies and pioneers during March and April. Obtain detailed county maps of the territory assigned to you, from the county courthouse, state highway department, independent cartographer, etc. Studiously plan your coming activities for the most efficient coverage of the territory; select locations and speakers for any public meetings you may have; contact newspapers and radio stations witli news releases. Plan to share in this missionary campaign on week ends and to spend your vacation this profitable way. Campaign literature </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(What Has Religion Rone for Mankind! “This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font5">and any other bound book, for the months of June, July and August) orders may now be sent to the Society.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Memorial Week-End Activity</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Each year at Memorial time, Jehovah’s servants obediently gather to review the meaning of the Lord’s evening meal. It is a time of thankfulness to Jehovah for his loving-kindness and the provisions he makes for those whom he loves. It is also an appropriate time for all to scrutinize their zeal for his service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> This year Memorial will be celebrated on Thursday, April 10. All who attend are invited to express their appreciation to Jehovah by engaging in his service. Servants should prepare the Memorial weekend program for their companies as follows:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The service meeting and theocratic ministry school for the week of the Memorial will be canceled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching in Spite of Physical Condition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even as Job did not cease from testifying- to Jehovah’s supremacy and maintaining his integrity because of ill health, so Jehovah’s witnesses today do not quit preaching when sick. The 1952 “Yearbook” gives a number of such instances and shows how the Lord blessed those efforts</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Cuba, one who had been a publisher for less than two months had to go to the hospital because of illness. While there she witnessed all she could, and placed magazines with both the staff and the patients. One patient in particular showed much interest and so when both had gotten out of the hospital a study was arranged for. As a result of that study there are at least three new publishers today. (117) A very similar experience Is contained in the report on Czechoslovakia. (120, 121)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brother in South Africa on sick leave went to the country to recuperate. He made such good use of his time that, when he left at the end of three months, ten persons had begun to tell the good news to others and a nearby company arranged to take care of the interest. (217)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Virgin Islands a study was begun with a patient in the Municipal hospital. This patient then began a study in Spanish with the elderly man in the bed next tb his. Soon four studies were being held. An English clergyman noting the two patients studying together asked permission to examine the “New World Translation” and then requested a copy for himself. He expressed admiration for “the way Jehovah’s witnesses ALL went out and preached and gave aid to the people in Bible study”. Yes, effective witnessing can be done on the sickbed. (211)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year Jehovah’s servants have learned to appreciate more than ever before their need of God’s Word, his holy spirit and his organization if they would be properly instructed. Among the activities that God’s visible organization repeatedly stresses, and not without good reason, is that of making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the United States of Indonesia a sister called back on a home where she had placed only a booklet and that with but a lad. The result? A once truth-hungry Roman Catholic sheep (the lad’s mother) is now a witness for Jehovah. Is it possible that in our own territories there are some truth-hungry sheep still confused by false religion all because we neglect to follow up or call back on all our placements? (216)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Guatemala a missionary placed a bound book with a man. She called back even though he had assured her that he had no time for study Alert to her opportunities she was able to start a study with his wife. The son, noting how much his mother was enjoying these studies, provided three fifteen-minute periods weekly for the broadcasting of the truth on a radio station using both regular and shortwave channels. (149)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Usually we have good intentions as regards calling back on those with whom we have placed literature or where interest is manifested But do we always persevere until we have contacted the prospective sheep? A publisher in Venezuela, while engaged in the house-to-house work, heard of someone who was interested. Only after repeated attempts was that one contacted. In just a short time this one himself was conducting three home Bible studies and wanting to be baptized at the next opportunity. (242)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>To Those Who Say, “I’m Too Busy”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Too busy to obtain freedom and comfort and gain the prize of everlasting life? Are they really that busy? Or are they just using that statement as an excuse to discourage what they think is “just another salesman” for whom they have no time? This oft-heard remark presents a definite challenge, and. in order to make sure that they know of the all-important message of God’s kingdom being offered to them, it becomes the responsibility of each publisher to effectively overcome this barrier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Endeavor always to actually present the good news at the door. Do not rush headlong into a witness with the thought of beating a time schedule. Being prepared, making your presentation in a friendly manner, unhurried, deliberate and coherent are very important. Here is one way this objection can be effectively overcome:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, it’s true that most people are very busy these days. I’m a busy person myself. Yet, today I've arranged my affairs so that I can present to you a very valuable and profitable message. One that can give you hope and comfort and relief from the distresses and ills of present-day living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Week End </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the Memorial talk, after the emblems have been passed, the speaker should tie in the meaning of the Memorial with faithful service, both by those of the remnant and the “other sheep”, and show the importance of letting the good news of the now-reigning King and his kingdom be heard by all. Closing announcements regarding field service for the week end can then be made by the company servant or another capable brother.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Friday is a holiday in many sections of the country. Here house-to-house work edn be arranged in the morning and time devoted to making back-calls in the afternoon and evening. On Saturday morning all who can should meet for house-to-house and store-to-store magazine work. Saturday’ afternoon can include street witnessing. Make Saturday' a real magazine day. On Sunday the entire group will meet at the Kingdom Hall at 9:30 a.m. for a short and instructive program, and then arrange to be in the held by 10 a.m. (In some territories pub-It is the message regarding the heavenly establishment of God’s kingdom, for which millions pray and which other millions desire </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to see.</span><span class="font5"> I can understand your position; there is much to be done these days.

<p><span class="font5">We must judge the sincerity of their statement and proceed accordingly ; thus it is not a case of refusing to show consideration for their circumstances. If it is discerned that the person is legitimately busy, do not attempt to give a detailed presentation of the offer. Rather, during the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">campaign, offer a magazine or even two for variety in subjects and color and simply say: “I’m sure you would like to obtain these </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazines now for only 5c a copy. I can, then, call back within a week and explain the purpose of my visit and how this magazine can be of aid to you. In the meantime you will have had an opportunity to examine this enjoyable magazine.” lishers may be able to start earlier.) A short program may also be had on Saturday' morning, featuring effective magazine witnessing. A public meeting should be arranged and advertised for Sunday afternoon or evening, followed by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. This will fittingly climax a full week end of theocratic service to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Attendance figures for 1951 indicate that there are many persons that need assistance to get started in field service. In the U. S., almost 50.000 more persons attended the Memorial in 1951 than the year previous These are the persons that need our help. A special effort should be made to assist them and also those who will attend the Memorial for the first time this year. Use the full month of April and especially the Memorial week end to render them needed assistance. Make definite arrangements now to take someone with you during this week end.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font7"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">The following two demonstrations aim at gaining maturity and increase by aiding the publisher to take part in service and to reach his quota of two subscriptions during the campaign. The first develops theme of mature publisher aiding less mature one »n calling back on placements and helping publishers to organize for systematic follow-up. The other illustrates a simple and interesting method of making effective back-calls in which all publishers can engage.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I: Mature publisher assists the less mature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part 1 (5 min.) Two publishers, Brothers “Mature” and “Willing<sup>-</sup>”, are engaged in lively discussion relative to their personal accomplishments and interest in “Watchtower” campaign. Conversation centers around each publisher’s reaching his quota of subscriptions during campaign. “Willing” inquires if “Mature” has had much success in campaign. “Mature” says he has his quota oi subscriptions and good possibilities of obtaining more through proper follow-up and more house-to-house work. Directs question to “Willing”: “flow are you making out?” “Willing” responds that he does door-to-door work regularly but all he places is a magazine here and there. Yes, he kept a record of names and addresses, suggested definite paragraphs for householder’s personal observation; but wonders how to approach these people when calling back to obtain subscriptions. “Mature” points out wisdom exercised in suggesting particular paragraphs for householder’s consideration, because in doing this he has something definite to work with when making back-call; a common ground for approaching the interested person. Suggests that he go along on these magazine placements and assist him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part 2 (5 min.) “Mature” and “Willing” make back-call. “Mature” introduces himself and “Willing” and then brings attention of householder to February 15. &nbsp;1952, “Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“WiHing” had left her to examine. Householder acknowledges “Mature’s” introduction and turn* to “Willing”, whom she recognizes from previous call. Says she was too busy during his last visit to allow him more time, but is grateful for “Watchtower” magazine, which she read and examined during her leisure time; she was particularly pleased with paragraphs 7-12, which “Willing” had suggested she look over relative to her question on “Difference of Understanding” as to what Memorial emblems mean “Willing,” delighted over interest shown by good-will person, carries on witness, gets subscription and invitation to aid subscriber in studying magazine systematically. Upon departure “Willing” says, “Calling back on magazine placements is not so difficult after all.” He is now ready to go alone to next call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II: Aiding publishers in systematic follow-up of subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part 1 (6 min.) Assistant company servant is looking through record cards. Makes out list of those who have not reported as yet, those who have not made any back-calls during the first two weeks of the month and those who have not as yet gotten subscriptions. This list he turns over to Bible study servant, who in turn refers to last year’s S-10 forms as well as current ones and makes out slips to be called on. These are turned over to company book study conductor to give to publishers who originally got subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font2"> (4 min.) At company book study contact point for evening back-calls, study conductor approaches publisher and gives her some calls. She is hesitant and says she doesn’t know how to handle them as yet. Would he be able to assist her? Yes, the study conductor assures her that it is a privilege to aid publishers to share in joys of all forms of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Part 3 (4 min.) Publisher and study conductor make a call on the householder listed on slip from S-10 form. Householder admits she enjoys reading magazine and it is her constant companion before bedtime. She noticed magazine had stopped coming about two weeks ago and planned to renew but other things got in her way so she forgot to renew. Yes, she wanted the magazine to come to her home and would appreciate more information about the “Watchtower” people Publisher renews subscription and makes arrangements for future visit. Study conductor and publisher proceed on to next call, with publisher expressing joy at ease of following through on subscription calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Calling Back on Subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I: (5 min.) Two servants of the company are discussing the matter of “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They show how many subscriptions have been taken to date, and vender what eftect magazines have, going to subscribers twice a month They begin to discuss what points in “Watchtower” appeal to them most, and truths recently brought out that should be very striking to the average person. They then hit upon the idea that a good way to make a back-call would be to tell the subscriber that you are making a special call to find public reaction to our new-style “Watchtower”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II: (12 mm.) Two or three calls are then made with the above thought in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dach brother, in calling, explains that he, as representative of the publishers oi’ “Watchtower” magazine, is visiting all subscribers to get a crosssection of public opinion of “Watchtower”. He explains the magazine does not stand still, but constantly seeks to make itself more practical and helpful to its readers. What does subscriber find good in it, and different from other magazines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some express opinion, then witness takes opportunity to discuss interesting point further Some have not read, or express no opinion Show how to demonstrate feature, article or specific point, arousing householder's interest and arranging for another call A housewife, businessman, farmer, and office girl could be approached, and features that especially fit these persons could be highlighted Housewife might be interested by appealing to short articles she can read to children and use to help train them (pages 99, 117**. 1:&gt;7***), or questions in the back, businessman, the articles on travel (pages 121**, 153***), on-the-spot view’s of local conditions (page 115**), or the frank, true, timely discussions of world affairs in light of prophecy (page 69*); farmer, the lucid illustrations (pages 105, &nbsp;&nbsp;112, &nbsp;&nbsp;113,</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Offer Freedom Through Magazine Distribution</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Freedom! Restoration of Godgiven rights! A year of thankfulness to the Creator! These were the things that were looked forward to and enjoyed by God’s people under the typical Theocracy every fiftieth or jubilee year. As in Israel on the first day of the jubilee, Jehovah now commands his servants to “cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound . . . and proclaim liberty throughout all the land”.—Lev. 25: 9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">April—a Magazine Month</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> And what better way is there to proclaim liberty to the captives and tell the prisoners to “go forth” than using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazines? During April, let the jubilee trumpet sound with a mighty blast by making special effort to get copies of these magazines into the hands of the people. By subscriptions and single copies, from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">house to house,</span><span class="font5"> and store to store, do your part to sound the proclamation. Make this a month of real magazine activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> During the last month of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign time should be scheduled for the regular door-to-door subscription work. If a subscription is not placed, you should endeavor to leave single copies of the magazines on the regular contribution in every home. But in addition to the regular subscription work put forth sp eial effort in house-to-house magazine distribution. During April, instead of engaging only in the regular magazine street work, all publishers should obtain territory for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">house-to-house</span><span class="font5"> magazine distribution. Why not every one really try this means of magazine distribution? Each publisher should strive to place at least five copies of every issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font5"> in house-to-house magazine service. During this magazine month we want to stress getting these magazines into the homes of the people and then call back to help them gain benefit from the vital life-giving information contained in them. See if you can’t place more magazines in house-to-house work than you formerly have on the streets. Try using just one magazine alone—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> one week and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">the next. See what happens.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> When single copies are placed a record should be kept of the persons obtaining them and routes started so that the latest copies of the magazines can be distributed regularly. Let’s all put forth a special effort in</span></p></li></ul>

Regular return visits should be made where magazines are left, endeavoring to start home Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> During the last year 10,983,157 individual magazines were placed in the field in the United States, to compare with 9,028,995 in 1950. Think of it, a grand, thrilling total of 51,600,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines were printed for distribution in 1951 throughout the world in many lan</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Circuit servants are appointed by the Society to serve as its representatives visiting organized companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, isolated groups of good-will persons and pioneers to assist them in carrying out their local Kingdom activity. Before one is appointed to serve as a circuit servant, he is required to be capable and Scrip-turally qualified to serve as such. He must show himself to be a mature servant of the Lord, having served acceptably several years as a pioneer or in some other responsible capacity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> His semiannual visit with a company begins on Tuesday morning and concludes on Sunday evening. During that time he will hold two meetings with the Society-appointed servants and book study conductors. The first meeting should be held at 6: 30 p.m. on Tuesday, followed by a talk to the entire company at 8 p.m. The final servants’ meeting will he scheduled for the end of his visit. At these meetings company matters will be discussed and the circuit servant will be governed by and advance the Society's policy for all of his recommendations to improve local organization for Kingdom service. Company records will be checked during his visit and counsel given to each servant in accordance with the Society’s policy. When records are improperly kept, the circuit servant will instruct the servant how they are. to be kept.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> At the final servants’ meeting, the circuit servant will discuss with the servants his report and the recommendations made in it prior to mailing it to the Society. Any suggestions or objections by servants in the company should receive due consideration, and, if necessary, adjustment accordingly should be made in the report, after which he will mail guages. Let’s continue to increase the number of magazines being distributed in the United States. From these figures you can see that a wonderful work is being done with the magazines. So let's make April an outstanding magazine month and build up our magazine distribution to even greater heights so this good food will go into the homes of the people regularly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Why not arrange to make April’s activity a grand climax to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign, and include within our plans the giving of assistance to any that need our help to get started in the service?

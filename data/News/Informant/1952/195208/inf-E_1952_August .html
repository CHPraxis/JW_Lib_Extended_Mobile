<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> With confidence and happy assurance, Christians continue to pray, “Let your kingdom come.” (Matt. 6:10, AH’) Although “the kingdom of the world lias become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ”, not yet has the mighty organization of Satan been destroyed. (Rev. 11:15, All’) Its towering hulk continues to cast a shadow of oppression over the face of the earth. But shortly the Kingdom rock cut out of the mountain of God will smite and shatter the feet or foundation of this blasphemous organization, plunging it to destruction. Satan will be abyssed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The work of aiding others to know of this kingdom is continually expanding. To keep apace during the summer we have expanded it into territory not regularly covered with the Kingdom message. Two months have already been spent in this special campaign, leaving but one month. We want to utilize it to the full by completing the assignment of this isolated territory if possible. Be sure to keep sending in the names of people with whom literature is placed, in order that the Society may continue to stimulate this interest after you leave the territory. It is encouraging to note that over 50,000 names have already been received. Companies are cautioned, however, not to send in the names of individuals who live in company-held territory. Interest in such territory should be cared for by the companies.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">Pioneering is a wonderful privilege of service! Nothing in this old world can compare with it, for what possible corresponding joy could there be to carrying out one’s dedication vows before Jehovah in this superb way? None, absolutely none. over the country indicate that much interest is encountered and considerable literature is being placed in these unassigned territories, with many fine experiences resulting. The Lord’s blessing is clearly evident upon this abundant sowing of seed in these areas. So, continue to take good supplies of literature with you, including tracts and catalogues, and be fully prepared to “do missionary work” and “thoroughly accomplish your ministry”.—2 Tim. 4:5, A’W.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> August is the last month of the 1952 service year. What does an analysis of the company’s activity show? Will you reach the 10 per cent Increase in publishers for the year? Most companies should be close to reaching their quotas and, by an all-out effort in the final month, they will be reached. Servants, pioneers, conductors and mature publishers, make it your business to render the needed assistance to those who are new and inexperienced in the field service. Do not just invite them to go with you. Make definite arrangements to take them with you regularly and patiently instruct them in effective ways of preaching the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Which One Will You Attend?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Blessings are in store for God’s servants. A well-planned and prepared program making for a bountiful feast spread out in abundance is provided in the 35 district assemblies to be held in the United States during August and September. The assembly locations were carefully selected so that it would be convenient for all to attend. (See your copy of the July 15, 1952, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for the dales and locations.) Make every possible effort to attenil one of these assemblies so graciously provided by Jehovah through his visible organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The assemblies will be for three full days. Now is the time to begin preparing, planning and arranging your affairs so as to be at the assembly city of your choice from the time of the opening session, on Friday at 9:30 a.m. (interesting and lively discussions start the program), right on through to the completion of the last session Sunday evening at 6 p.m.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Thrilling Reports from Unassigned Territory </span><span class="font3">Jehovah's undeserved kindness and blessings have abounded in many ways as is evident in the variety of experiences had by the publishers working in unassigned territory. For example: “Met party who said. ‘Never heard of this work, but it sounds like something I’ve always wanted. Glad to see a work like this going on.’ A disabled veteran said, ‘I’d give anything to know the Bible.’ He was very meek, and asked many questions. Almost asked for a study.” Another remarks: “Woman listened eagerly anil happy to hear of the new world : has son that is a complete invalid, and he insisted on getting the books, because reading is one of the few things he can do. Hoped he too could ‘leap like a hart’ in the new world.” One said, “Alan, I’m sure happy to see you; first time in 25 years that Jehovah’s witnesses called on me. I want subscriptions to both magazines and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Defeating Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 1952 “Yearbook&quot; givers many examples of how our brothers throughout the world are defeating persecution, proving indeed that ‘no weapon formed against us will prosper’.—Isa. 54:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A district assembly was being held in Cyprus. The Devil’s agents tried to break up the public meeting by creating a disturbance that lasted for 15 minutes, during which blows were exchanged and chairs smashed. Eventually the troublemakers were ejected from the hall. This disturbance attracted hundreds, and so instead of breaking up the meeting as they planned, the Devil’s agents caused a greater witness to be given. (119)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Particularly bitter is the persecution that our brothers have to endure in Greece, where officials brutally beat Jehovah’s witnesses and boast that they &quot;will make them useless even for Jehovah!’’ Yet in spite of all such persecution, and though without the benefit of any assemblies, Kingdom Halls or even the singing of Kingdom songs, the report of our brothers in Greece shows a 26 per cent increase for the past year. (144-147)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor have the weapons formed against Jehovah’s servants in Bechua-naland, Africa, prospered. There, &quot;in the face ot [severe beatings] and cruelty of the tribal chiefs the local brothers continue to let their light shine. They are learning to defeat persecution, and some persons of good will, noting the courage of the brothers, are also taking their stand on Jehovah’s side and learning to publish. The . . . prospects for expansion are brightest . . . where the persecution has been the greatest ’’ (220) Are we as successful in voiding the weapons the Devil forms against us as are our brothers in Cyprus, Greece and Bech-uanaland<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As our district assemblies draw near the questions arise, “Will each servant of Jehovah attend if at all possible? How many will fail to attend because of lack ot appreciation or lack of resourcefulness<sup>0</sup>’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who have failed to attend assemblies because of lack of funds would do well to consider the examp e set by our brothers in the British West Indies as given in our 1952 &quot;Yearbook’’. For these brothers to attend an assembly involves a great sacrifice. One group hired a schooner to take them to the island where the assembly was being held, and to pay for the transportation they shipped along bananas, mangoes, etc., which they sold upon their arrival. (101)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Circuit assemblies In the Philippines often provide much excitement and fan the enthusiasm of the brothers to a bright glow. At one assembly a government official tried to cancel the public meeting but failed. Mobsters threatened to break up the meeting; hoodlums stoned the meeting place and those going to and from it. Yet in spite of it all 1,000 attended the public lecture, 700 of whom were strangers. What a joy it must have been to have had a share in that triumph over the enemy! (206)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Italy the clergy caused the permit for an assembly to be canceled after it had been given. The assembly was nevertheless held by using two homes which were connected by public-speaking equipment. Again the Devil’s efforts boomeranged as this high-handed procedure caused more to get their eyes opened. (160-162) Regardless of the opposition or circumstances Jehovah has a blessing awaiting us at our assemblies.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>To Those Who Are Indifferent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Often we meet people in our ministerial activities that are indifferent toward the message we carry. They do not want to be rude and will politely listen to us, but they may be thinking, “This may be all right for somebody else but it doesn't concern me.” Yet it does concern them, being a matter of life or death. We want to direct their minds to appreciate this good news, if at all possible. The problem is, how? Usually the best thing to do is to get them to express themselves and thus locate their interests. Thought-provoking questions, hypothetical problems and reasonings may be used to do this. Consider the subjects of law, education, world conditions, science, etc. Work these discussions into a constructive witness about the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When an Indifferent person Is obviously a parent you might say: “Being a parent you are doubtlessly concerned with the proper education of your children. Schooling is important for the children, yet how much more important it is that all persons, young and old, receive a proper religious training. The majority of people do not regularly attend church, and it has been found that most of those who do attend do not have an accurate knowledge of the purposes of Almighty God, the blessings of his promised kingdom or of the requirements for entrance into God’s kingdom. They fail to realize that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font3"> knowledge means everlasting life and sure success. So, whether you attend church or not, I am here to bring you this life-giving knowledge as contained in the holy Word of God. Let me</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ready completed your schooling? Could you, by diligent organization of personal affairs, continue in pioneer service as many others are doing? And those of you who contemplate the pioneer work, would it be possible to start by considering and arranging your affairs so Kingdom interest receives first attention? And you who are in the regular pioneer service, are you organized so as to be able to continue in this most wonderful of privileges? Here is an example of what can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One pioneer sister tells how she organizes her home for more efficient service to Jehovah: “Although I have been in the truth for only three years and have family responsibilities, I have taken advan-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font3">show you what this book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Ererlastitiy Life’</span><span class="font3"> says on page 247 about ‘Rearing Children in Divine Favor’. . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Or you might take this approach: “As you view conditions existing in the world .today that adversely affect all of us, have you not also noticed that these conditions are fulfilling Bible prophecy? Did you know that the very work that I am doing was foretold in the Bible? and that all of this is a sign of the early destruction of wickedness and the taking over of earth’s rulership by the righteous kingdom of God? Allow me to show you this from the Word of God and the Bible aids that are provided for this very purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perhaps personal interest may be developed with the following: “Moral collapse is the shame of our generation. Principles are being set aside for expediency. Indeed, people the world over are falling away from the rigjiteous principles of the Bible, having no respect for the laws contained therein. Take for example the sixth of the Ten Commandments : ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ Then look at all of the wars fought in the lands claiming to worship God—Christian killing Christian. Jew killing Jew, etc. Certainly this shows a lack of proper understanding and a flouting of the principles of God. Christ Jesus said if you want life that is everlasting you must love your neighbor as much as you do yourself; also love your enemies. . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be fully convinced yourself that the message you carry concerns everyone and then express that conviction.</span></p>

I find that I always achieve the best results in my pioneer ministry by being thoroughly organized for the Lord’s service. My husband is in the truth anil he tries to do everything he can to aid me in organizing my pioneer service. ’This co-operation gives me the necessary help to remain in the full-time work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I schedule my time to harmonize with my family responsibilities. Each day at (&gt;: 30 a.m. I rise and prepare all essentials for the morning and noon meals.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">YOUR</span><span class="font6"> SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">August is the last month of the special campaign to present the three-bound-book offer. How is your company doing in the campaign? And you as an individual? The first demonstration will enable each company to see how it has been doing thus far. The other will assist to improve company organization by having a discussion of things that wilt benefit alt publishers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">SCENE 1 (7 min.) Assistant company servant is sitting at a desk checking the Publisher’s Record cards when the company servant enters. The company servant relates the results of a back-call he made on party who promised to take the otter when contacted in the door-to-dOor work last Sunday. Did he place the combination? Yes, and he had a very enjoyable discussion with householder and was able to show him how the books are to be studied. It may develop into a Bible study. The assistant company servant then says he has been checking the Publisher's Record cards to ascertain just how many books have been placed by publishers thus far in campaign. During June, 331.446 books were placed by publishers in United States and our company placed ....... For July</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the company placed........, making a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">total for June and July of......books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Appropriate comments are made as the company servant begins to check through the card file. He notes that some cards show no placements at all during the two months. Why? Their discussion considers the importance of all publishers’ engaging in the door-to-door work (April “Informant”) and that necessary assistance be given to publishers in aiding them toward maturity, as often stressed in the &quot;Informant” The servants make a note to organize company activity during August so as to give these publishers the assistance needed for field service. Checking further, the company servant notes some cards show only one or two books placed during the campaign, and asks the assistant company servant what he thinks might contribute to this. The reply: possibly not sticking to the offer, publishers’ not being properly prepared with literature when going out in service and not having a good presentation in mind, etc. After briefly discussing these points the company servant says, ‘By having the combination along and really offering it to householders with an effective presentation, many fine experiences are enjoyed. Some time on the program can now be profitably used in relating a few experiences, so let’s invite publishers to relate some they have had while placing the three bound books in the current campaign ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE 2 (8 min.) Each placement is an experience and often points are made in making the placement that are helpful and beneficial to others The week before this part is handled on the service meeting, it would be well for the company servant to announce that part of the next service meeting will be devoted to relating encouraging field service experiences. This will enable publishers to fully prepare to bring out helpful points that will assist other publishers to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize for . . , </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">on the scripture considered. This spiritual stimulation is appreciated by all of us. After we complete our meal, the children of school age cooperate by pitching in together to take care of the necessary breakfast chores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Each morning as soon as the children are sent off to school my husband and I leave together, lie drives to his work and has arranged so he can return home with a neighbor, turning the car over to me for </span><span class="font2">overcome obstacles met in the field. These can be experiences in assigned or unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) A company book study is closing. Conductor, Bro. Drowsy, says (in a tired way), &quot;Well, I guess that’s as far as we’ll go tonight. Here are some names the company servant gave me who haven’t oeen in the service this month.” Reads names. Then those attending begin talking about their own affairs; make no mention of theocratic or company arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (3 min.) Company servant talks to three study conductors after service meeting. He says one group is doing extra well, one doing all right, but Bro. Drowsy’s seems to have trouble progressing. He asks if they can devise a plan to help. Bro. Drowsy says he does not know what to do more than he does now; publishers just do not seem to take interest in study or service. Company servant offers to substitute for Bro. Drowsy while he attends study of Bro. Alive; perhaps he will get some pointers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (9 min.) Bro. Alive’s study closing. Conductor makes remarks bringing out high point or two from study that can be used in field with three-book offer. Then he makes final arrangements to get all in group ready for service on week end. (They may be going in isolated territory or in own locality.) Then he asks who wants help on back-calls, and mentions several placements made by group last week. One desires help; another volunteers to go along. Conductor very briefly recites experience he had calling on a brother needing help last week, mentions two or three such who need to be called on this week. He selects brothers living nearby to see these and suggests what they can do to help them. He shows real interest in getting all in group to study and work as one</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After meeting, Bro. Drowsy asks Bro. Alive how he does so well. Bro. Alive explains: He always prepares list of announcements in advance, then at end of study he does not forget them. He plans ahead to make study interesting and also plans remarks to make while group is together to direct conversation into proper channels, so this hour will be fully theocratic. Publishers have personal and secular affairs they can handle at other times; he tries to keep this study hour as &quot;unto the Lord” and wholly dedicated to His service. Bro Drowsy seems wakened, declares he w<sup>T</sup>ill start immediately making his study as progressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">my use in the field service during the day. I always make arrangements to take some publishers along witli me into the field service. We organize our work by doing house-to-house service in the morning and devoting our afternoons to back-calls and Bible studies. During lunch time members of our ear group usually eat our home-prepared food together and discuss some of our contacts with persons of good will.

Remember, if you write for rooms and you receive no reply or assignment card for some reason or another, do not worry or be unduly concerned. Simply proceed to the assembly city, inquire for your rooms at the rooming department and then accept and occupy them. This in itself is a good witness and shows forth the proper Christian attitude of good conduct. If you are unable to accept the rooms assigned to you for reasons beyond your control, please cancel your reservations immediately so that others may be assigned.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God requires his servants to be qualified teachers, able to ‘handle the word of truth aright’ and ‘instruct in mildness’. Of great importance in acquiring these qualifications is regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">attendance</span><span class="font3"> and sharing in the weekly study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To get full benefit of this study everyone in attendance should come prepared to participate by commenting on the questions propounded. This will improve your ability to speak, broaden your knowledge, more firmly impress vital truths in your mind and also add to the liveliness and instructiveness of the meeting. Read and study </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as soon as you receive it and then go over it again just before the company study. Some find it best to study a complete article at one sitting ; others take a few paragraphs each day; and some find it stimulating to study in a family group at a time when other Kingdom activities are not interfered with. (See lesson 45 in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.)</span><span class="font3"> This is a fine way for parents to train children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Each one should make it a point to comment at least once at the study. Comments need not cover every point in the paragraph, in fact, it is better to have two or three short comments. Publishers who desire to comment on a certain paragraph may make this known to the study conductor, b'y raising the hand high enough to be seen, so that they can be called on to do so. Once you start speaking it is comparatively easy to continue. Speak loud and clear so your expression will be heard by all.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">“My pioneer obligations come first in my life, so I stay in the field service each day till 4 p.m. and then hurry on home to prepare the evening meal. While we partake of the physical nourishment I discuss the most interesting experiences of the day with my family as well as recount some of the details of my personal Bible studies and the interest that I was able to stir up. I am very pleased with my planning because of the many blessings that are mine as a result of good organization. I wholeheartedly recommend organized pioneer service for all witnesses of Jehovah.” also be encouraged and helped to attend so they will benefit from it. When the study follows the public lecture invite the strangers to remain for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. Form the habit of encouraging one another to attend and set the proper example by being there yourself each week, for certainly you could not spend your time in a more profitable way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study conductor should conduct a lively, interesting meeting. Plan ahead so the meeting is kept within the hour. If time permits occasional comments may be made by the conductor, but these should be limited to points that were overlooked or where additional explanation may be necessary. As time allows, scriptures not quoted may be read by publishers in the audience. Those who are usually hesitant to make a comment are generally glad to read scriptures. Only the most qualified brothers who are fluent readers should be selected by the study conductor to summarize the paragraphs. A different one should be used each week, where available. Notify them at least a week in advance; they should attend the theocratic ministry school for training in good reading. Brief closing announcements relative to activity for the week may be made by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study conductor or the company servant.</span></p></li>

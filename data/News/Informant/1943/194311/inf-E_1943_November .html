<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Faithfulness Required</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">At this time it seems well to consider the blessings that the Lord has poured upon His people during the past year, and particularly to do so in the light of the slogan for this month: &quot;Trust your proved faithful brethren.” How do we show that we trust our faithful brethren? Why should we trust them? What blessings have resulted from applying this Theocratic precept?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We show that we trust our faithful brethren when we send contributions to the Society; when we engage in the house-to-house work; when we make back-calls and conduct book studies; when we participate in the magazine work; and when we carry on all these activities according to organization instructions. We show that we trust our faithful brethren by enrolling as pioneers ; by accepting appointments such as servants in a company and as special pioneers; and by faithfully discharging the obligations of such appointments. During November we are going to manifest our trust in our faithful brethren by pushing the work with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the Yeio World,</span><span class="font2"> on a c o n t r i-bution of 25c. in united activity with our faithful brethren. Yes, we will accept any and all of these provisions as coming from the Lord through His “faithful and wise servant”, whom we trust because It is the Lord's choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These service requirements are not advocated for any personal reward, but. like Jeplithah of old, your faithful brethren rejoice to have a share in the vindication of Jehovah's name ami to see Him gain the victory, and they want to see their brethren share in that victory. Our faithful brethren ‘pay their vows’ unto Jehovah; for they not only preach activity in the field and the giving of one’s all. but they practice what they preach, and by such “fruits” we know them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What blessings have resulted from trusting our faithful brethren whom the Lord has appointed to direct the work in the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping in Line</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our faithful brethren arranged for a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign early in the year and which was the most successful one we have had thus far. This result was possible only because they were faithful in planning it and the brethren in the field were faithful in responding thereto. At its close we were showered with such further blessings as the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font2"> the “Call to Action<sup>-</sup>’ Assembly, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 12. Add to this the waging of an offensive war against the modern Ammonites, who had dared to invade “our land&quot;, and which resulted in victory after victory in the courts of the land. This required much work on their part, and was possible only because the publishers in the field trusted their faithful brethren by carrying out organization instructions in the face of intense opposition. Then came the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, with its feast. Again our brethren had shown themselves to be faithful to the trust the Lord had given them by bringing forth things both new and old from His storehouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> as shown by the poster of the month, call attention to our obligations. Are we individually hewing as closely to the line as we can? Are we giving whole-hearted support to every command that comes to us from the Greater Jephthah through our faithful brethren? Or are we making mental reservations as to the advisability of carrying out some of these organization instructions, and therefore giving them only partial support or none at all? That such details are important and cannot be neglected with impunity, King David found out to his sorrow when bringing the ark to Jerusalem. (See 1 Chronicles 15: 13 and marginal references.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trust your faithful brethren. Yes, and not only should we trust those whom Jehovah has placed at the head of His work on the earth, but we are to trust all our tried and coworking faithful brethren. Special pioneers should help each other and faithful company publishers. General pioneers, company publishers, servants in the companies, one and all, should assist one another. How much work could be spared at headquarters, straightening out misunderstandings that have arisen between brethren, and which are retarding the campaign of education, all because one or both parties failed to trust their faithful brethren I Trust your faithful brethren and you will be able to help them and they to help you. Trust your faithful brethren and so defeat the Devil’s purpose to s o w discord among the brethren. Trust your </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROVED FAITHFUL BRETHREN, </span><span class="font2">one and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We all desire to see the name of Jehovah vindicated and to enter into the New World of freedom. The Israelites of old. whom God. by the hand of Moses, led out of Egypt, did not trust their faithful brethren Moses and Aaron. As a result, all save a few died in the wilderness. They had good grounds for trusting them; none for not trusting them. Did not Jehovah repeatedly show that He was with Moses and Aaron ? The same is true today. The record of the work accomplished under the direction of the Society this year again furnishes abundant proof that Jehovah is using and blessing your faithful brethren, who, under the King Christ Jesus, are directing the campaign of education for men of good-will. And as we see faithfulness in service and keeping of integrity on the part of those about us, let us trust these brethren also. All who desire to have part in the vindication of Jehovah's name and to enjoy the blessings of life in the free New World will now heed the injunction, “Trust your proved </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFUL BRETHREN.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Forms Will Help You</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>All Companies Should Use Them</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is pleased to announce to the brethren that it has two new forms to aid the brethren to do their work more thoroughly. The “Monthly Breakdown of the Study Conductor’s Monthly Reports” will show the number of studies conducted each month, the new interest and the associated attending </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies, company book studies, back-call book studies, service meetings, and Theocratic ministry studies. It will be kept by the assistant company servant. One of these forms has been sent to each company, and in the future you will receive one each year with your yearly supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Progressive Inventory of Stock” form enables the stock servant to keep a week-by-week inventory of all the company literature. A sample of this new form has been sent to all companies. They are now available at the rate of .$2.00 per 1.000, or 10 for 2c. Instructions for the use of these two forms appear on the forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also, a change has been made in the Back-Call slips, to show &quot;Records Run or Study Conducted”. The Study Conductor's Report slip, mentioned in the June </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> shows the number of different persons attending the meetings, how many are “new interest”, and how many are “associated” with the company. Henceforth the Territory Assignment Card will have three columns instead of two. The third one is entitled &quot;Number of Times Worked”, and will show the number of times the publisher has worked the territory since it was taken out or renewed three months previously. Au addition has been made on the reverse side of the Territory Map Card, showing the date the assignment is to be returned for renewal or cancellation. If everyone will study these forms and use them as directed it will tend toward better records with much less work than heretofore.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Study the “Course in Theocratic Ministry”</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Apply It in the Field</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> was prepared as an aid to all of the Lord’s servants to equip them for good work in the field. The vast educational campaign now in progress (and it is increasing daily) requires more of the Lord’s servants than ever before. They must improve their Theocratic ministry. Everywhere the publishers appreciate the importance of this course, and reports indicate it is being well attended. Already many expressions disclose a marked improvement in language used and manner of speech of the publishers, both those enrolled and those attending the studies. Everyone is giving more attention to the delivery of the testimony in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The advantages of the course are numerous. The student not only learns how to gather pertinent material on a given subject, how to arrange it in logical order, and how to use the various Bible helps and secular helps, but he has wonderful opportunities for practical application and experience. The great value of the course is seen in that when it comes to putting into operation the things learned its use is not limited to those enrolled. The real application of the learning is in the field itself, especially in connection with the back-calls and studies. Every publisher who makes back-calls needs to have the training outlined in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry;</span><span class="font2"> and, since every publisher should make back-calls, there should be a 100-percent attendance at the Theocratic ministry studies. Furthermore, because it was designed for use of Theocratic publishers, without the application of the knowledge in the field the course will be of little value. The course in Theocratic ministry and field service are inseparable. All publishers, whether male or female, whether enrolled or not, should arrange to attend these studies regularly, as well as participate in the service meetings and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> is Jehovah's provision for you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Gathering Old Records</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">For the past several months the various companies and units have co-operated splendidly in gathering and shipping old scrap records to the Scranton R e c o r d Company. However, this arrangement has now changed. Hence, please do not ship any more scrap records to the Scranton Record Company, nor to the Society. All companies now gathering old records will please store them until further notice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Notice</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">We are pleased to advise that the Department of Justice. Bureau of Prisons, has issued a circular permitting the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Tiuth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and the “Study Questions” booklet to be admitted to all federal institutions.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“More than Conquerors” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Studies the Big Feature for Month</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Every Placement Should Mean a Back-Call</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">December is designated “Moke than Conqvekoks” Testimony Period, thereby calling our attention to the text for the year, “More than conquerors through him that loved us.” (Row. 8:37) Who today can deny the application of this truth to Jehovah’s witnesses? December brings to a close a year marked by victory after victory granted His servants because of their faith in Him and faithfulness in His service ; and December will be a further opportunity to be “more than conquerors” by all moving forward with the free education of men of good-will, opposers and hindrances notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of December, all freedom-upholders will keep ‘shooting the arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance’ and keep 'smiting with the arrows’ of truth bundled together in the strong, unbreakable, invincible union of truth, the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Male You Tree&quot; </span><span class="font2">and its question booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every placement of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> is to be followed up within a month with a back-call using the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot; Study Questions.</span><span class="font2"> This question booklet should never be left when the book is originally placed. Hold it for the back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those persons obtaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> will naturally look through the book. Many of them will read pages 375 and 376, “How to Study This Book,” before they have read the other portions of the book; they will continually feel their need of the question booklet mentioned in the fourth paragraph on page 375 and the additional scriptures it contains. Ulis is particularly true of those who are of good-will. The field is being continually prepared for the publisher’s back-call by means of the “arrows” of truth of Jehovah’s deliverance striking the minds of the readers as they go through the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To insure consideration of pages 375 and 376 by the person obtaining the book, it would be well to briefly refer to them when the book is placed. Do not dwell too long on them, however. Save most of it for jour back-call. Simply show them that such instructions are contained in the book, and suggest that they read it as they have opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first back-call should be made informally. It is not necessary, when you place the book, to make any specific date for calling back; simply say, “I would like to drop in sometime when I am in this vicinity again, and see how you like the book.” Then casually drop in some evening within the month. When you call back you will have by far the best opening for a back-call that you have had to date. Those who have carefully read pages 375 and 376 are ready for you if they are at all interested in the truth, and are curious, if not actually desirous, to consider the study booklet. Show them the study questions, a n d how they may be used, anil offer to come back and carry on a simple study with them, their family, relatives or friends or anyone else who they think would be interested. To those who have not read these pages and who do not show much interest, you can say: “Did you have time to notice pages 375 and 376, on ‘How to Study This Book’? These pages contain some very valuable points that are worthy of consideration.” Open the book to those pages and point out, in the first paragraph, that the purpose of the book is to aid the people to understand the Holy Scriptures, 'which are able to make them wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.’ Then consider with them the second jiaragraph, which shows the scripturalness and advantage of studying with others; after which you could take up the third paragraph, emphasizing the desirability of parents’ assisting their children by such a study. There are numerous press releases and other newspaper stories indicating the tremendous delinquency among young people these days, which can give force to your statements here. Then call their attention to the Society’s provision for aiding them in such a study with “Study Questions” ; demonstrate the use of the questions; offer to come back and hold a study with them and their relatives, friends, family, or anyone else; but whether they have or have not read the book or have or have not read pages 375 and 376, you have prepared a splendid opening for a back-call and a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publisher must recognize his part; the obligation rests upon the publisher to see that proper preparations are made for the part he has to play in this great educational campaign. The book should have been read by him, and the publisher should be familiar with its contents, particularly with its many high points, giving considerable attention to pages 375 and 376, which he is to discuss with the people. The publisher should be familiar with the instructions contained on the first and second pages of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free” Study Questions,</span><span class="font2"> and at all times follow the outline therein. He should read this foreword to the assembled group before starting the study, so that all may be familiar with the arrangements and co-operate fully. He should also be familiar with the additional scriptures referred to in the chapter that is to be taken up at that meeting. To do this effectively and to lie used by the Lord in this great educational campaign require considerable work on the part of the servant of Jehovah; but when the publisher does his part he is equipped and looking to the Lord and depending entirely upon our great Teachers, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, to use him, and he may be assured of a blessed and profitable study to the glory of the Lord and to the blessing of all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Testimony cards for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> are going forward with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has arranged to provide all &quot;Study Questions&quot; booklets at 4c each to companies and 3c each to pioneers. To the public, 5&lt;- each. Orders may be sent in immediately. As soon as you have your &quot;Questions&quot; booklet arrangements should be made for the back-call campaign as outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each one, therefore, accept this 'bundle of arrows’ from the hands of Jehovah our God and smite, not once, not twice, not three times, but “until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate”.—Isaiah 6:11.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Some Advice</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font2"> is not to be taken into the field: hence the necessity of thoroughly studying it at home and at Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended, </span><span class="font2">however, should be a regular part of your equipment. It should be used in dealing with officers of the law, judges, persons who might oppose the work, and others who might ask questions in good faith. A clean, neat copy should be available for submission to such persons for their investigation, as a loan. Therein is contained much valuable information to help break down prejudice and opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended</span><span class="font2"> is in stock and may be ordered by pioneers or companies, at five cents per copy.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Your Phonographs Playing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the Records You Have on Hand</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>“Children” Records Available</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A good percentage of the phonographs in the companies have been receiving very little use lately. This, it has been said, is due to a general belief on the part of some publishers that the absence of a record to introduce the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> is an indication that the phonograph introduction is not necessary now. Such conclusion, however, is an error on their part. As in the past, the most complete presentation of the Kingdom message at the doors is still by the use of the doorstep setup. There are as yet no improvements over that method. Therefore every available phonograph should be in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because new records cannot be supplied now is no reason to end the phonograph presentation of the message. There are many 41-minute</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly Report</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> No. 631, dated November 24, 1943, will have a 32-page supplement containing a complete report of the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly. This is a special number and can be used to great advantage by the publishers, particularly among people of good-will; therefore a good supply should be ordered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those having magazine orders with the Society, will, of course, receive their regular number of this issue the same as any other. Additional copies of this number may be ordered by such companies at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2ie a </span><span class="font2">copy. Companies that do not have</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>September Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The report for September is gratifying and shows regularity and steadiness of activity in the field witness work. No new all-time peak was reached in any phase of the service, though improvement over the August report is very marked. Average back-calls by company publishers came up to 3.3, over last month’s 2.8. Averages in hours and back-calls for pioneers show up much better than last month (August) , being 121.9 hours and 29.9 back-calls. An interesting fact is noted in that 867 more pioneers have reported for September 1943 than reported for September 1942, indicating many are seeing their privilege of full-time service. Much work is being done among the people of good-will through the book</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Company Recommendations for Servants</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">When a company servant or other servant in a company moves away, resigns, or is otherwise withheld from performing his assigned duties and it becomes necessary for the company committee to recommend other brethren, recommendations giving the following information should be drawn up and signed by the committee: Company or unit; full name of first and of second choice; age; years in service; anointed or Jonadab : average hours and back-calls for past six months; and reason for recommending change. If company servant or assistant company servant is recommended, please give complete address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Until such time as the Society makes a new appointment the company servant or assistant company servant will be responsible for taking care of duties of servants vacating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">recordings available in every company. and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">any of</span><span class="font2"> these can be used effectively at the doors. If mention is made of another publication, then carry that publication (if in stock) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and offer both on a contribution of 50c. For example: The Society has about two thousand &quot;Children” (P-262) records on hand at Brooklyn. These should be in the hands of the publishers and in use. As long as any records are on hand the phonographs should be used. Order “Children” records, and then offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> and the new book together. All the records contain the truth; all records can be used well in introducing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> with a brief supplemental witness. So keep your phonograph playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">magazine accounts with the Society will, when ordering 10 or more copies of this special number, receive them at 2ic a copy. Any number under ten (10) will be at 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers in company territory or immediately adjacent to a company should send in their orders through the company. Get in touch with the company servant or advertising servant as soon as possible and order the number you require. Pioneers in isolated territory may order their magazines direct. The same rate applies to pioneers as to companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">studies. 50,145 book studies in September report 114,621 people of good-will or “new interest” in attendance. All of these are prospective brethren and publishers. Keep applying 2 Timothy 2 : 24-26 to these lovers of freedom and they too will soon see their privilege of publishing.</span></p>

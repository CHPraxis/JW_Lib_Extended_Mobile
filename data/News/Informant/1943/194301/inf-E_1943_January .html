<p><span class="font3">Advertising servants should prepare now to get the extra supply of magazines to be used as sample copies when presenting the offer to the people.

Also, a thorough check of the sound equipment, both records and phonographs, is to hi' made, and these should be put to good use during the campaign Record l'-154 (&quot;Instruction&quot;) is an ideal record to use with the offer.

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be a Publisher and Make Back-Calls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Now in these present times we can see the enemy rapidly closing in on Jehovah’s servants and employing every means within their power to stop the work. But the Lord's work advances by leaps and bounds despite all tlie enemy efforts. Now is when each one must sever all connections with the Devil’s organization that lie possibly can and take his stand wholly, entirely, for the New World government if he wishes to live under its righteous rule. The text for January is, “'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.” (Matt. 0:33) That means that we cannot let anything interfere with the work of &quot;preaching the gospel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every company publisher should start this month and set aside a certain amount of time each day—about 2 hours on the average—to devote </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">erelusively</span><span class="font3"> in some phase of the Lord’s service near home or wherever convenient, getting a territory assignment from the local territory servant. Let each one do this and not let anyone or anything keep him away from that service. Take care of home duties and other responsibilities at some other time—put the Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Systematically Plan Your Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cover your territory in advance with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> in accordance with the November </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> No. 11 contains a very important and interesting message for all people of good-will. Everyone who reads it will want to learn more of that good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In keeping with the Lord’s instructions, we should take to the people the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font3"> because they need these publications. These contain priceless information about the most important thing that will ever be in existence, God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Use the house-to-house record in all urban territory. Call back on everyone with whom you place a book, a booklet or even a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font3"> if they show some interest, with the idea in mind of getting them more interested in God’s kingdom. Many times in the magazine work one meets people who may sympathize with the work; take the name and address and make a back-call on them. When one is engaging in the store-to-store work, many businessmen are found to be interested, but haven't time to talk during business hours; make arrangements for a back-call on them there at some other time-or in their homes. Get all the back-call names in your territory you possibly can and put forth a special effort to call on those people at least once during January. Make at least 12 back-calls this month and every month from now until “the cities be wasted” and there is no one left on whom to call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every back-call is a potential book study. Try to start a book study with the people as soon as possible. Start the study in either </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The .\ne World </span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font3"> The back-call and bookstudy work should lie viewed as the most important features of the Lord’s service, as that is where the &quot;other sheep” are really taught to assimilate the 'Word of God. All other parts of the service work to this one end, organizing and conducting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Poster</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To keep before the minds of the publishers the work for the month of January, the Society is sending to all companies, with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> a poster of allractive design calling attention to Kingdom interests first. This poster should be hung on the wall of your Kingdom Hall or company headquarters meeting-place for the month of January, after which it should be taken down. If desired it may be mounted on cardboard or plywood, or merely put up with thumbtacks at the corners. This will impress upon the brethren that January is the time for Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let the light shine. Let everyone hear about the New World and its many rich blessings. Ail should have a keen desire to engage in all phases of the work, striving for CO hours and 12 back-calls this month with greater zeal and determination than ever before, and let absolutely nothing interfere with the Lord's service; put Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Return of Cartons</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The shortage of new shipping cartons has let up some, but the Society would bo pleased to receive the very best cartons that the companies have and do not need for their own use. It has been noticed in the past that brethren returning these cartons have been negligent, because approximately 40 percent of those shipped back have not been usable for re-shipping. When saving cartons for the Society’s use, please bear these points in mind: Do not cut or remove the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cloth tape.</span><span class="font3"> Break down the cartons by removing the paper tape and opening up the flaps at both ends, remembering to leave the cloth tape on the carton. Important! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Do not fold at the cloth tape.</span><span class="font3"> Only good cartons should be returned. They should lie put in bundles of about 20 cartons to a bundle and tied with strong rope. Please do not ship less than 100 pounds in a shipment. Your description on tlie bill of lading should be as follows: “Corrugated cartons K. D. flat. (Used)” Note: In all </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CASES COMMUNICATE WITH THE </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn office before shipping.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Pioneers’ Change of Address</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">When pioneers change their residence, they should always send us a Change of Address slip showing thereon what their full new address will be, allowing us about one (1 1 week to make the change in our stencils. Every time you change your address, be sure to leave your forwarding address at the post office where you </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">previously</span><span class="font3"> obtained your mail. If, after changing your address, you get mail that has been forwarded from your old address, be sure to check and see if you sent us a Change of Address slip, and if it has had time to be changed. When changing your address, always use the form provided by the Society for this purpose. Every pioneer should have a supply of these on hand and use one every time he changes liis address. The Society does not make change of address when it is written in a letter with other correspondence, as all Change of Address slips are handled separately from all other mail. Pioneers should always designate </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">clearly</span><span class="font3"> whether they are &quot;Special Pioneer” or &quot;General Pioneer”, as delays are caused by a failure to do this. Second-class, third-class, and fourth-class matter cannot be forwarded without additional postage; therefore all such mail must be sent direct to the correct address in order to assure prompt delivery. When you neglect to send us a Change of Address slip, you don’t get your mail, it causes us much extra, unnecessary work, and there is no excuse for such failure. Please co-operate with us to this extent, so that everyone will receive better service with the least expenditure of effort and time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Conduct in the Field</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>There Is a Time for Everything</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">On page 28 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions</span><span class="font3"> the statement is made: “At all times the brethren should have in mind that they are representatives of The Theocracy, the Lord's ambassadors, and deport themselves in keeping therewith. Jehovah does not approve of that which is unclean; hence all Theocratic publishers should be clean, present a pleasing appearance when in the Lord's service, and use proper language.” If any of the men or women who associate with the Lord’s people are careless in their personal cleanliness they practice an injustice upon their brethren who assemble with them at studies and meetings, and are a cause of stumbling to many people of good-will who, not knowing the truth, are inclined to judge the value of the message by the appearance of the ones participating therein. That does not mean one should be ashamed because he cannot afford to dress as well as he might like to, or have new’ shoes or clothes to wear in the witness work. We may not be financially able to dress according to the very latest style trends, but everyone can and should be clean and wear clean clothes while in the service. Let all representatives of The Theocracy, therefore, conduct themselves in this respect as becoming the dignity of the Lord's kingdom, which they represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conduct on the Streets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Continuing, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> says. &quot;Be calm, sober of mind, vigilant, and always kind. Show loving devotion to all of good-will. Be bold, yet never rude. Mind your own business of declaring the Kingdom message of comfort to those of good-will.” The primary purpose of the street witnessing is to reach the people with the message of the Kingdom, many of whom we would not otherwise have the opportunity of serving. Therefore, while in the streets with the Theocratic message we must keep our minds centered upon our work, be sober of mind, and be alert at all times to give the Yvitness. It has been found that some publishers go in pairs and threes and have a conversation while in the street work. In doing this, even though the conversation may be concerning the Kingdom work, the publishers invariably give improper attention to the placing of the message and miss many opportunities. It is therefore much better for street publishers to stand alone, except, of course, in the case of new publishers out for tin' first time. Proper street witnessing is done in an orderly manner, each publisher having a definite assignment from the advertising servant for his corner or position in the block, working alone. If trouble is expected from mobsters or assailants in certain cities, or if two publishers desire to work together. then let the publishers work in pairs but stand ten or fifteen feet apart, alwaj s near enough to help out if trouble arises. The time for discussion of field experiences is not during street witnessing, but at service meetings or at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To &quot;be bold . . . mind your own business of declaring the Kingdom message” requires a publisher to speak out the slogans concerning the magazines or the titles of the articles in the current issues and to watch the passers-by for any sign of interest. Some publishers judge their success only by the number of magazines placed. That is a good way, but there is more to it. One’s fearless declaration of the truth causes some to take an open stand for or against the truth. Boldness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and proper con</span><span class="font3">duct in the street work means one must take the initiative and in a kind manner, confident, yet never rude, approach those persons who may be standing near one’s assignment waiting for a bus or for someone to come out of a store. Also watch for those waiting in parked cars for shoppers and offer them the magazines, briefly explaining the contents. Itefrain from lengthy- conversations, but, if you find interest, arrange for a back-call later. Take the initiative ; approach the people; and watch your placements on the streets increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a suggestion for being completely equipped as a street publisher : Have your magazine bag and magazines; carry with you a copy of the latest bound book and booklet, folders inviting the people to the meetings, your testimony card for identification, back-call slips, and a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended.</span><span class="font3"> Proper decorum and courageous publishing will increase your efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Studies More Important!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Time is scarce these days; there fore we must be as efficient as possible in our magazine work. While on the streets let us do our best. This is an important part of the Kingdom witness, but magazine street-work should not take preference over organizing book studies, which study work is the most important at tliis time because it is through study that the people of good-will become mature in the truth, able to see the right way to go to the Kingdom and able to teach others also. Every publisher should have some part in the street work, but it is suggested that you choose the time during the week when fewest people are at home and back-call work is not so successful, such as Saturday afternoons and evenings, and when a good number are on the streets, and do your street work at such times. Many publishers have found it inconvenient to have their book studies and model studies on the same nights as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study or service meeting at the company headquarters, so they come early and devote an hour or so to street work before these meetings. This is a very good practice. Brethren living on farms and who have to travel to towns and cities on Saturdays have found it well to arrange to devote an hour or two to street witnessing while in town, thus conserving gasoline and not neglecting a part of the Kingdom service. When weather is bad publishers can concentrate on store-to-store and route work. This does not mean that store-to-store work and route work should be done only in inclement weather (for every business section should be assigned by the advertising servant for store-to-store work) ; tint rather it means that the publishers should put in their time by increasing this activity, and not stay at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one should be discouraged from participating in the street work when he wants to, but every publisher should have in mind the planning of his work so that he can get in the most time and not neglect the now most important work—organizing studies. Do your street work when back-calling is not practical; and this does mean do street work.</span></p>

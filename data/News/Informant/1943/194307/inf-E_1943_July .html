<p><span class="font3">Practically at the center of the North American continent, Minneapolis, Minnesota, provides an ideal location for the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly hub city. It is hoped that from this point convention programs can be transmitted over telephone lines to 100 cities throughout the United States. This is by far the biggest undertaking the Lord's organization has ever attempted in the way of conventions, but it is in keeping with the everincreasing Theocratic Government. Jehovah’s blessing has been richly upon His people this year, and we earnestly pray He will direct the activities in connection with this vast assembly to His glory and praise and for the comfort of His servants. The complete list of the cities, in every part of the United States, will be published soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, toward making this assembly successful, we have things to do. Until the Assembly is over, talk about it, everywhere, among yourselves and in the field. Invite all people of good-will in your territory to mark August 20, 21 and 22, 1943, and begin to arrange now to attend. Play “Peace—Can It Last?” or one</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Publishers Had a Part</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Consolation</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 622 to Carry Details</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This year has witnessed many victories for the ‘Jephthah Society’ in the preservation of the Theocratic worship. The most recent, during June, reversed the previous stand concerning saluting the flag and declared Invalid and unconstitutional the ‘sedition statute’ of the State of Mississippi which was aimed at the witness work. We give thanks to the Supreme God for his mercy in maneuvering the enemies of The Theocracy and His witnesses to cause this mighty witness and deliverance of His people. Additional information will appear elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very same day, Flag Day, that the U. S. Supreme Court ruled on the ‘flag salute’ case word was received that the Australian High Court decided that the ban placed upon Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watchtower Society in Australia was illegal. Thereby our brethren in Australia have once more been granted freedom to carry forward the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In connection with all these vic</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tories, the outstanding thing was </span><span class="font3">of the other series of lectures and encourage the interested to come to the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly for more good news. If you have copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the New World Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font3"> on hand in your company, place them in the hands of the people with the invitation to attend this year’s assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Information Later</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Details concerning the Assembly will be published in a special form in about two weeks and will be sent to all company servants and pioneers. Company publishers should get the information through the company servants at the meetings. This additional material should be thoroughly studied at the first service meeting after it is received. A list of all convention cities will be sent also, and should be posted at the company hall for the information of all attending meetings. Don’t miss a meeting in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the Lord’s .grace, many more will attend the conventions this year than any hitherto and an extensive witness will be given. Let us all advertise this event and let us pray Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the convention for the praise of His name thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the determination of the publishers to keep right on going regardless of mischief framed by men. In Mississippi the brethren kept right on witnessing. In the schools the children did not compromise following the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font3"> ease decision. In Australia the publishers faithfully continued witnessing for the Kingdom despite the ban. And the Lord’s people pushed the fight through the courts by every legal means, thankful to Jehovah for His guidance. This faithfulness of His covenant people must have been pleasing to Jehovah. He fought for His people. He has made it a little easier to continue with the Kingdom proclamation, and we can demonstrate our gratitude therefor by unitedly singing His praises with constancy and zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> No. 622 will carry a thrilling story of this entire matter. If you want extra copies of this particular issue just order extra copies of this number, but do not change your distributors’ amount. These will be sent in the regular manner, and charged to your magazine account at the usual rate of 24c each. If you do not have a magazine account with the Society, then send in </span><span class="font4">cash remittance with your order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">July Work Presents </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone Can Take Part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There Will Be Less Travel and More Reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Detailed consideration has been given to the work for the month of July. You have been informed in ! advance so that you may be prepared. Now the time has come. The work is set before you. You should i be ready with your literature and equipment in proper order, and your territory individually planned, so that you may engage in distributing the foreign-language literature and j the old English publications. There i is much to be accomplished. It will I require the zealous effort of every-i one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I The principal offer to the people ' during July is foreign-language literature which the Society (as well ; as many companies) has on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of this is being distributed free to the people, except the Spanish, and the latest book and booklet in each language. Complete instructions I regarding obtaining this appeared in the May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another offer during July is English bound books, if you have them, which include </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance. Creation. Reconciliation. Government.</span><span class="font3"> These are to be offered to the people at two on a contribution of 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The third offer for July is all booklets except </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last? 1'iyhtiny for Liberty on the Home I'ront, Hope,</span><span class="font3"> and the Model Study and Study Question booklets, to be offered at the rate of 17 on a contribution of 2.7c, or 7 on a 10c contribution. One of the afore-mentioned books and 8 booklets could be left on a 25c contribution. Larger combinations of the book and booklet offer can be arranged if desired. The booklet combination of 7 should include 3 colored-cover and 4 selfcovered booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The offer to be stressed particularly during the month will depend upon local stock on hand. If your stock and demand for foreign-language literature is large, then that should be your primary offer. Companies that have a large supply of the first five bound books should make that the predominant one. Many have a great number of the older booklets on hand ; and in such cases the booklet combination should be stressed. Endeavor, above all, to put out all of the foreign-language literature included in the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you run out of foreign literature or your English publications included in the offer, then you may place </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Neto World</span><span class="font3"> or other late book along with the latest booklet on a 25c contribution. Or, if you have plenty of the campaign booklets, offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and 8 booklets on a contribution of 35c. The offer should be introduced with the record P-302. If it is not available, use any record of your choice that you be</span><span class="font4">lieve fitting for the campaign.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Opportunities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Obtaining Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As in previous campaigns of this kind, the publishers should be charged the full rate for all literature that they cheek out, with the exception of the foreign-language literature which the publishers receive free. At the end of the month the publisher should make request for credit on the literature he placed, the credit being 9c per English bound book and 2c per English colored-cover booklet. Then the company will make the request for the total credit to be applied to their account from the Society, on the form which has been provided for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It can be seen that there are many opportunities to have some part in the July campaign. Each publisher who is able should be working in his individual territory. During the days and week-ends the entire offer should be stressed. In the evenings that you do not have back-calls or studies the booklet combination offer (of 17 on 25c contribution, or 7 on contribution of 10c) should be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who do not yet hold an individual territory assignment should work as a group in unassigned territory under the direction of the study conductors and servants. Proper record should be kept of the interested. Each study group should have group booklet work in the evenings and arrange for all of the newly interested to participate therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With all of the work to be done, do not neglect your back-calls and studies. They should be given constant, patient and diligent attention in order that those of good-will may be nourished; otherwise much of your previous witnessing efforts will be lost. Every person of good-will should be given the opportunity to take advantage of the special offer.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Approved List of Literature for Prisons</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">James V. Bennett, Director, Bureau of Federal Prisons. Washington, D.C., has issued a Memorandum for All Wardens and Superintendents of Prisons to permit each and every one of Jehovah's witnesses in such institutions to receive one copy of the &quot;Watchtower Bible, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, and one each of the following books: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World, Children, Salvation, Preservation, </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before ordering any publication that is not listed, to be sent to such institutions, it is necessary to get special permission from the warden or superintendent or commissary of the prison. The publications approved by Director Bennett may be ordered through the prison commissary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Provision has been made for the holding of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study once each week by Jehovah’s witnesses in each prison where Jehovah's wit</span><span class="font4">nesses are located.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Meetings Should Be Instructive</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Make Assignments in Advance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In a recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> (No. 10) Jehovah's witnesses were described as “practical Christians’’ and their work as “practical Christianity”. According to Webster, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">practical </span><span class="font3">means “capable of applying knowledge to some useful end; pertaining to, consisting of, or manifested in practice”. To be a practical Christian, therefore, means to act wisely, to put into practice the commission of the Christian, and to do so with the best means at our disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That is the purpose of the service meetings. At the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> meetings we learn to know Jehovah and His purposes regarding us, and in the service meetings we learn how we can most effectively carry out our commission in view of the conditions we face and the resources we have at our disposal. In other words, there we learn how to put into practice the admonitions given in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> It is very clear, therefore, that, as “faith without works is dead”, so attending the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> meetings while neglecting the service meetings will prove vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service meeting should be the most interesting meeting the company has, yet ofien it is the least interesting one. Why? This may be due to lack of careful planning and preparation on the part of the company servant and others who have part in the meeting. Then again, it may be due to lack of appreciation and co-operation on the part of the publishers themselves; for they not only should faithfully attend the service meetings but should be ready to take part therein as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the service meeting to accomplish its purpose requires, first of all, that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> articles be carefully studied by all, and particular preparation be made by the one who is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> consider them in the meeting. The main points should be emphasized by questions, discussions, a few supporting scriptures, and sum-up. All male servants should have part in the program at least once a month, while others, who show aptness and whose service record shows that they have the zeal peculiar to the Lord's house, may also be used from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan Ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These should be given their assignments well in advance, so that they can properly gather material and prepare and think out their talks in harmony with the counsel given in the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry.</span><span class="font3"> Particularly should the various servants be given the opportunity to discuss their part of the work. For Instance, the back-call servant should discuss “The Importance of Making Back-Calls” ; “How to Make Back-Calls” ; “How to Turn a Back-Call into a Book Study,” the opportunities for making them, and the progress the company has made in this feature of the work. This could be a series, appearing on the program once or twice a month, each time taking up a different aspect of this feature of the work. The other servants should likewise become fully acquainted with the importance and purpose of their particular feature of the work, and the best procedure, and be able to teach others regarding them. And, in all of these talks, do not neglect to fortify the arguments by appropriate scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then there is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Advice to Kingdom Publishers, Jehovah's Servants Defended,</span><span class="font3"> as well as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font3"> which should regularly </span><span class="font4">come in for their share of attention </span><span class="font3">so that the publishers do not become forgetful of important facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another very helpful and interesting feature in the service meeting, and which has been neglected altogether too much, is that of having demonstrations. Those who are especially successful in the various features of the witness work should carefully prepare a demonstration fully illustrating that particular feature, such as the use of the doorstep setup, the store-to-store magazine work, etc. These must be well thought out, with particular attention being given to the part of the householder or storekeeper, so that the demonstration is really effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And, finally, field experiences. All campaigns furnish special opportunities along this line. However, these should not merely be aimlessly related incidents, but should be told with a point in mind. The one conducting such a feature could stress and ask for these so as to direct the minds of the publishers in the most helpful channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If everyone does his part, taking advantage of all the provisions the Lord has made for him, each one, like David of old, will be able to say, “Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the New Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Get “Peace—Can It Last?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is pleased </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> announce that there is now a good supply of the latest series records on hand at Brooklyn. We are particularly fortunate in having a supply of “Peace —Can It Last?” (P-317 to P-330), which may be had for only $4.00 a set. The entire set of three 1942 convention talks (“The Only Light,” “Fighters for the New World,” and “Peace—Can It Last?”) may be had for $11.00. We may not be able to obtain further supplies of records for a while; so, if you want records, order them now and play them for the people of good-will between now and the assembly. Invite the people to attend one of the assemblies and hear more of these good things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We regret that we are unable to supply single discs of “The New World” (P-302) at this time. If and when supplies are available a notice will appear in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Waxing Phonograph Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren have inquired about the use of wax on the new recordings, to avoid motor drag and excessive wear. Experiments reveal that wax, in the majority of cases, does not prolong the life or wear of the record, but that the new records give better service </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">without</span><span class="font3"> a coating of wax. However, the wax does relieve motor drag. Therefore it is advisable to apply a coat of liquid or paste floor wax to the surface of the records only when it becomes necessary to relieve excessive motor drag evidenced by the motor’s being unable to pull the record through the entire recording.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reward Notices</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some publishers have had notices printed concerning an offer of a reward by the American Civil Liberties Union for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals performing acts of violence against Jehovah’s witnesses. It is improper to do this without express consent of the American Civil Liberties Union. So please refrain from printing such notices.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Our Goal Still 10,000</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The ‘Jephthah Society’ has issued a call for 10,000 willing volunteers for the full-time pioneer service. Are you going to be one of the willing volunteers and join the pioneer ranks? You are the only one that can answer that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no greater privilege than that of being a full-time publisher of the Kingdom message. True, the responsibilities are great; but the blessings received from carrying out these obligations far outweigh them, and the servant of the Lord rejoices to bear these burdens. This can be seen in the ever-increasing number of pioneers who joyfully take on these obligations. For the month of April 6,411 pioneers reported, setting a new all-time peak. During the month of May there were 437 new pioneers enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The text for the month of July is, “Redeeming the time, for the days j are evil.” The best way that one can possibly redeem the time is by full time in the service. Vacation period now for the school children gives them the opportunity to take advantage of this privilege and redeem the time. Consult your May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> for the details on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a great amount of work to be done now. The “other sheep&quot; must be found and fed on the lifegiving truths of the Lord. To find these sheep all territory must be thoroughly and searchingly covered. It is the “righteous requirement” of you to aid in the hunting and fishing for these sheep and then, after finding them, to aid in feeding them. All New World fighters are anxious to do everything within their power to advance the interests of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you taken to heart the admonition given to arrange your affairs to get into the full-time service if at all possible? Have you considered why you are not a pioneer and sharing in the joys of the full-time service? Is it because you are giving too much attention to things of the old world? Are you one who thinks the pioneer service is for someone else ? Remember, “according to your faith be it unto you.” Now is the time to get into the pioneer service and enjoy its blessings. Seek the Lord’s guidance in the matter and arrange your affairs to be a full-time publisher by convention. Be one of the 10,000 pioneers!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“Call to Action” Assembly Report</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>More Later</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Action it was 1 In the United States alone 76,045 heeded the “call to action” and joined in the April assembly. During the first two days of the assembly 910,573 books and booklets were placed. 3,663 new subscriptions were obtained. 101.608 copies of the magazines were placed. This work was accomplished in 207,171 hours. To be sure, everyone was very busy with the King’s business, and a marvelous witness was the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Sunday, April 18, immersions were held at all of the 247 assemblies where there were candidates who wished to symbolize their consecration to the Lord. You will rejoice to know that on that one day 2,441 symbolized. The Lord continues to add the increase. Other items, including reports of some of the assemblies in other countries, </span><span class="font4">will appear in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine soon.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Redeeming the Time, Because the Days Are Evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">—Eph. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Theocratic Government of the New World is on the increase; it is progressing. The publishers thereof must increase and grow with it. The faithful servant of the Most High will not let anything encroach upon his service to the Lord, but will defeat the purposes of the enemy by overcoming all hindrances and by increasing his time and activity. The publishers of the Kingdom are doing this well; for during April last they increased their time in the field more than 200 percent over April 1938. The number of publishers has doubled since the Theocratic organization became effective, in 1938. Are you doing your part? Ask yourself, How much time am I giving to the Lord’s service? How much of my time is spent doing non-essential things, and which I can utilize in the service of the New World? A close analysis shows that everyone CAN improve his service activity. July, which is now, is a good month to put forth more effort in “redeeming the time”. Ask the servants of the company to help you plan to devote more time. They will aid you; for it is an added privilege they have. “The days are evil,” and the best protection is to spend more time in the field. There is much time that can be redeemed. Are you as an individual publisher redeeming it? Let’s have more time in the field during July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">May Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report for the month of May contains both cause for rejoicing and food for thought. We rejoice because of another all-time peak of full-time publishers, 6,616; this being 205 above that of April, which was the previous all-time peak ; also because, with the exception of the “Call to Action” report, the month of May saw more publishers in the field than any previous month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, a considerable number of those who responded to the “Call to Action” failed to report in May. True, we had excessive rains and many floods, particularly in the middle west and the south, and doubtless these kept many out of the field service. But we should keep in mind that if we would live in the New World we must live for the New World now, and that means consistent and faithful service in spite of obstacles. Besides, the greater the difficulties we overcome, the stronger the answer we give to him that reproacheth our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is three years since the company publishers have had a peak in hours. The number of publishers is increasing; let us increase our hours also, </span><span class="font2">by’ REDEEMING THE TIME !</span></p>

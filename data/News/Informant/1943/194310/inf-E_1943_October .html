<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Make You Free”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">With the words “For freedom did Christ set us free&quot; still ringing in our ears ami the educating of &quot;men of good-will&quot; in our minds, every publisher of The Theocracy will be ready lo push off to a good start in the October campaign, “Defeat of Pi RSEcuriox” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Defeat of persecution does not mean that persecution will stop, but signifies that the Lord's people will keep witnessing in the face of all opposition and that persecution against them will accomplish nothing and will be defeated in its purpose. How appropriate then is the name of this campaign, in view of the many victories the Lord has given his organization during the past year! For example, the many court decisions which were handed down by the courts recognizing the right of Jehovah’s witnesses to worship Jehovah. Our “Free Nation's” Theocratic Assembly world-wide was also a great victory defeating persecution. Not only in America is persecution receiving a setback, but all over the earth, such as the lifting of the ban, and the stepped-up activities now, in Australia, and the faithfulness of the Lord’s people under restraint in demonized Nazi lands resulting in a great witness there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Expressing our appreciation for these victories in Kingdom service should make October our biggest month of field activity to date. During this campaign the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot; </span><span class="font1">and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the Nem World</span><span class="font1"> will have their first distribution to the public. The combination will be offered on the regular contribution of 25c. Consignments for the companies and special pioneers are being sent out as rapidly as possible. and to accomplish this the factory is now running an extra shift, working in the evenings. If your consignment does not reach you by the time of the campaign, then use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Neic World</span><span class="font1"> (or any other book) and the latest booklet you have as your offer. We expect to get your consignment to you on time, and, by the Lord's grace, we shall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Sure to Follow Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You may not receive in your consignment as many new books as you could place; therefore every book that you place should be followed up with back-calls, having in mind the starting of a book study. We are in a major educational campaign. Since book studies are where the Lord's “other sheep&quot; are assembled and taught the truth, it makes them of utmost importance. By now you should have read and studied your new book, with the aid of the question booklet, becoming thoroughly familiar with its contents. So you know that this book will be a real help in our studies, as it makes the truth so easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be diligent in getting into your individual territory and calling on all the people living there. Use your S-15 House to House Record and make sure everyone has the opportunity to have and study </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘The Truth Shall Make You, Free&quot;.</span><span class="font1"> It is your obligation to call on these people, ‘hunting’ and ‘fishing’ for the Lord’s “other sheep&quot; who are seeking true freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you do your part in defeating persecution by exercising your freedom to the glorifying of Jehovah, then you may rest assured that Jehovah will bless your efforts as stated in James 1 : 25: “But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and eontinueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his doing.’’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Consignments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The month of October will be one of great activity by the Lord's people. The September </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> outlined the October campaign in detail. Companies and special pioneers are being consigned a two-month supply of the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall . Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font1"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the Heir World.</span><span class="font1"> The number of books and booklets sent ' to companies is determined from their past activity. When this supply is used up you may re-order after November 1 what you will need. In case your supply does not reach you by October 1, don't sit down and wait for it, but continue to work with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Meir World</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies that were advised they were not to receive a consignment may order at once, returning the card they received authorizing them to order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special pioneers are all being consigned the same quantity of the new publications, namely, 60 books and 400 booklets each. Where there is a group of special pioneers working in the same assignment, the consignments will all be shipped to one of the pioneers, who will divide up the shipment on the above basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">General pioneers will not receive a consignment, but must order their</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Lot for Us to Work With</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As freedom-lovers gathered at the 100 assembly points of the “Free Nation's&quot; Theocratic Assembly, they awaited with keen anticipation whatever in the way of releases the <sup>1</sup> Lord's channel would have to give. To put it mildly, they were not disappointed! Again. Jehovah gave a thundering reply to those who had accused His servants of following a man. and again He, the God of the free, gave proof to His people that , their pathway would shine brighter unto the perfect day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the stirring keynote speech by Brother Knorr on “Standing Fast for Freedom”, which burned into the minds of all present the great truth that “fob freedom did Chbist set vs free'’, the Society's vice-president and legal counsel introduced the first release, the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship,</span><span class="font1"> in an address on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This booklet is a “first aid” manual for all ministers of Jehovah God, so that they may stand fast for freedom. Thoroughly understand it, so that you will know not only what to say and do, but also when and how to apply that knowledge. This booklet is not to be carried with you into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship </span><span class="font1">was only an appetizer, or the “introduction” ; the main dish, the “body&quot; of the convention releases, came on Saturday afternoon at the end of the lecture “Free Education for ‘Men ot Good-will’ ”, and after the Declaration, when the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font1"> was released by the president of the Society. Never has the Society pubsupplies of new books and booklets. In ordering, be sure to order only a two-month supply, until after November 1. Your order should not exceed the special pioneer consignment of 60 books and 400 booklets for each lished the Kingdom message in so interesting, so clear and complete a manner as in this, its latest book. Faith-inspiring and fascinating is the theme of freedom that runs through its thirty chapters: the interesting setting of its opening chapter, “The Truth Shall Make You Free,” introducing the theme; the way it glorifies the chief and grandest Subject of all study, “A God of Truth” ; then on to 'Creation'; “Loss of Freedom”; “The Book of Freedom&quot; ; “Freedom's King Appears” ; &quot;Freedom-loving Witnesses” ; and so on to the final chapter, “Freedom Now I” Its simple, beautiful and logical presentation holds the beginner and fills him with comfort and hope, while the student of many years revels in the many new Hashes of light continually being presented to the mind and heart. What an ideal textbook for book studies!</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">pioneer. If ordering for more than one pioneer, be sure to state how many pioneers will be supplied from that order; otherwise the order may be cut down. Orders should be sent to us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">immediately,</span><span class="font1"> if you have not already done so, and we will get your supply to you as fast as pos-j sible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The factory is now running two shifts and the brethren at headquarters are doing their best to get this literature printed and shipped to you, and, by the Lord's grace, they will. All companies, special pioneers, and general pioneers should now put forth every effort to get these new books and booklets into the hands of the people during the next two months.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">And so that no time may be lost in organizing book studies, the question booklet on this latest book was released in the evening of the same day, it being release number three. It has 2,000 additional supporting Scriptures carefully indexed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The final release, the dessert, or “conclusion” of the releases, came Sunday afternoon, at the end of the stirring and powerful speech &quot;Freedom in the New World”, which constituted a challenge to the whole freedom-conscious world. Your leaders make you a free world? What presumption! Can they free the world from demon rule? Well, Jehovah can and will! But your leaders, in spite of all their boasts and claims, will enslave you more <sub>;</sub> and more until Jehovah, the God of the free, destroys all enemies of freedom at Armageddon. Your only hope for freedom is His New World. And what a freedom ! Freedom from demon rule, and its concomitants, selfishness, religion, suffering, and death! What a message!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Recordings to Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has on hand a Rood supply of the recording ’Teace—Can It Last?” We also have in stock “The Only Light” and &quot;Lighters for the New World&quot;. These are the latest recordings available, and should be used as extensively as possible now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society will be glad to receive your order for these, mainly “Peace—Can It Last?” so that they may be put to use at once. For the present no more recordings can be made, because of shortage of material.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Free Nation” in Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Educational Campaign Brought to the Fore</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rich Blessings Ours</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance!” Thus the theme of the keynote speech of the “Free Nation's” Theocratic Assembly was developed and echoed throughout the entire earth as assurance of victory and freedom to the Lord’s people. Gathered together in 100 cities in the United States and many others in Mexico, South America, Cuba, Hawaii. Britain, Africa. Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, and many other localities, thousands of the citizens of the Free Nation and their associates from every nation, kindred and tongue were rejoicing as these words of triumph penetrated even the clamor of global war with a message of hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The First Release</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this powerful keynote opening. throughout the three climactic days of assembly the point of deliverance to freedom for the Lord’s people was stressed. All then returned to the field, which they had left for a short season, fully determined to STAND FAST FOB THEIR fuee-dom, and not again be entangled with the yoke of bondage. &quot;For FREEDOM DID C.HR1ST SET US FREE.” Resolved now are Jehovah’s witnesses to continuously smite the earthly visible organization of Satan with the bundled arrows of Theocratic truth as long as any part of it remains. In invincible unity of understanding of truth, with various instruments and having been instructed In their use, the witnesses of Jehovah continue to call on the people, giving to the wicked oppressors of free men notice of their doom. Day after day they go—from house to house and city to city, meeting people at the doors, on the streets, in the market places, in places of business, and everywhere, —confident that somehow, in some way, the message will continue on and on, reaching each and every captive of the present wicked organization. They must continue ‘shooting the arrow' and ’smiting' until every last one of the &quot;other sheep” has been gathered and offered freely an education in the textbook of freedom. The Bible, from now right on through to the complete establishment of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This offensive movement needs equipped fighters, and part of such equipment was revealed in the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship,</span><span class="font1"> which will require study and application on the part of the brethren. Thus equipped j ou may prove to all, friend or foe, (bat our freedom to preach as ministers of God soars high above the reach of earthly power.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention, Company Servants, Stock Servants, and Pioneers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">To effect saving in shipping costs and to more quickly dispatch orders, the Society many times combines pioneer orders with company orders. Also, in the larger cities, the orders of the various units are combined and shipped to one address, although each order is written up on a separate invoice. Sometimes, because the party receiving the bill of lading and invoices does not cheek the same, delivery is not immediately made to those whose orders are included in the shipment. We therefore remind those receiving the orders to carefully check each shipment and invoice received, and, If</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Free Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although stressed, this work was not started at the Assembly. The free education of the people in God’s Word has been going on for years, and must continue, and will continue, by the Lord’s grace. The talk on “Free Education for ‘Men of Good-Will’ ” brought to the fore that educational work with the Kingdom truth is the most essential instruction that can be given to them. This point should be burned into the heart and mind of everyone as he engages in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in mind always the points of the Declaration unanimously adopted at the Assembly. Briefly, they were to the effect that Jehovah God has made us free by his truth and through Christ; that our freedom will be used for no selfish purpose, but we must perform our commissioned duties by locating and educating “men of good-will” in the way to life; that our work is not subversive of present governments, but promotes full respect for law. order, and righteousness: that the textbook of freedom is the Bible; and that in the postwar era we will extend the publication of the Kingdom truth and increase the number of free Bible-study classes. “We are in favor of free education of all ‘men of good-will’ concerning The Theocracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The thrilling release of the new book followed immediately, with the Society's president saying, “To everyone at this Assembly from five years old upward who will accept it in the spirit of this Declaration one copy of this book will be given free.” All of us received free copies under these conditions; therefore let us not forget the obligation which falls upon us, but let us go on with the free education of “men of good-will” in the &quot;Textbook of Freedom”. Our book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Tree’’</span><span class="font1"> will remind us daily to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The final day of assembly stressed the freedoms and blessings promised in the New World of righteousness, which are so marvelous that the men of this “old world” dare not even promise such to the people in their so-called &quot;new order”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention, Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those brethren who signed up for pioneer service during their vacation and are now planning to return to school should advise the Society of this, in order that your name may be removed from the list. Those desiring to continue in the pioneer service should advise us. in order that our records may be changed from &quot;Vacation Pioneer” to “Regular Pioneer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it is also for another or for other parties, to deliver the order or orders ; but if unable to deliver, then notify the party or parties so that they may be able to call for their shipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If there are any complaints regarding shipment received, the party to whom shipment is addressed should make the complaint. Also, if at any time you do make a complaint and then shipment is received or whatever you complained about is located and straightened out, then you should immediately notify this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the Assembly came to its end; but the occasion will long be remembered by the Lord’s people, and its effect shall be painfully felt by Satan’s visible organization, and manifest in the blessings to the “men of good-will” by the faithful and diligent field-service activity on the part of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Credits on July Campaign Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is noted on receipt of the monthly report cards for July that many companies are noting under &quot;Remarks” the number of coloredcover booklets they placed that month. Apparently credit is desired for this. However, in the May </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> instructions were given on how to request credit for this on a special form sent a month later. Credit will not be given merely from notation on your report card, but only from the Credit Request Form provided by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distributors</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society is pleased to advise that the restrictions causing the limiting of the magazines supplied to tlie companies and pioneers have been lifted. Each company should therefore bring their magazines, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> orders, up to their full requirements immediately. For increasing the number of magazines you need, use the S-66 Magazine Distributor Blank. Do it while we can supply the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Trust Your Proved Faithful Brethren”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Preparations for November</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Time moves by swiftly for the Lord’s servants. With the many unforgettable experiences of the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly fresh in our memories and the messages there delivered still ringing in our ears, our Calendar shows us the month of November draws near. We see that the text for the month is Philippians 2: 29, with the precept, &quot;Trust Tour Proved Faithful Brethren.” That is good admonition. But who are the &quot;proved faithful brethren”? How can we identify them? Why is it so important to have this counsel now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord sets forth His will and the requirements for faithfulness at all times. This he does for the benefit of men. Those who desire to prove faithful take heed. They consecrate themselves to Jehovah God and seize upon His will (including organization instructions) and make it their own will. They diligently follow His commands, consistently and zealously engaging in the work of singing His praises and carrying out the free education of “men of goodwill”. They have agreed to serve Jehovah without end and they set out to do so. By their works of righteousness you can easily identify them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today all the faithful ones work together in unanimity under the direction of Christ Jesus. His instructions are sent out through the Theocratic organization which the Lord has brought forth in the earth, “the Society.” It is composed of the “proved faithful brethren”, having been tried by the Lord and gained his approval. Therefore you should have perfect confidence in the tried</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">August Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The August report is very encouraging. Some of the outstanding items only are mentioned here, because of lack of space. A new peak of full-time publishers is one of them; 6,84(5 reporting, being 85 over July, which was the previous peak. The average hours for company publishers is 18; which is the best we have had since June 1940. This shows real activity on the part of the publishers, as considerable time was taken up with activities in connection with the Assembly, which could not be reported as field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Its weakest point seems to be the average number of back-calls for the company publishers, which was only 2.8. If. in the 100 cities, the publishers’ devoting considerable time to locating rooms, working in conjunction with the preparation of territory, cafeteria, etc., for the “Free Nation's” Theocratic Assembly interfered to some extent with the August back-call work, then the September report should show a marked improvement because of the new interest created through Assembly activities’ being given attention by them. Undoubtedly the same stimulus indicated in the increased number of hours and of publishers will show up here from now on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">and proved faithful Society and stick closely to it for your good. Instructions sent out through the Society are confidential to the brethren and are to be discussed among the consecrated. They are not for general public disclosure. They are provided to aid you and comfort you; they are private to you. Do not disclose to the enemy the course you will take, and put no trust in the organizations and men of this old world. Safeguard the interests of the Kingdom and co-operate with your proved faithful brethren, serving the Lord with them. Mature ones are appointed as servants in the company organizations. Trust them. Their counsel and aid will prove priceless in helping you to keep free from the old world and in improving your service in the new world. The November text states: “Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation.” (Phil. 2:29) Have due respect for your proved faithful brethren and associate with them. That is the wise course now, because the days are evil and the enemy is ever alert to interfere with the Lord’s work. Discuss private Theocratic matters among the consecrated and co-operate in carrying out the instructions well. Thus will oneness prevail, and the Lord’s rich blessing be with all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the unconsecrated ones talk about the Kingdom message only, not confidential matters involving the work. During the month of November the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font1"> will be the principal literature offered, on the contribution of 25c. Prepare now for a full month of activity during November with your proved faithful brethren.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>“Watchtower” Campaign Continues</span></h1>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Attend </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Meetings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">According to our New World calendar. the text for the month of March is. “Study to show thyself approved unto God, . . . rightly dividing the word of truth.”—2 Tim. 2:15. Never before has that admonition been so important as at the present time. For today not only must we be prepared to answer all questions relating to the doctrines of the Bible, but we must be prepared to take full advantage of the ever-in-creasing opportunities to present the issue clearly and forcefully before the rationing and other boards and before the various courts. Many golden opportunities to honor the name of Jehovah before such bodies have been lost just because the brethren were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> alert and prepared to speak boldly in the defense of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘quit ourselves like men’,</span><span class="font1"> and therefore be approved of God, we must be prepared to wield the “sword of the spirit” with skill. That requires much study. The Lord lias graciously given us many helps, and we should avail ourselves of all of them. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> should be eagerly read and then diligently studied, so as to make the points and arguments therein one’s own. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study meeting should be faithfully attended by all. By our actions we are either saying. “I rejoice at thy word, as one that find-eth great spoil.” or are saying, “The table of the Lobo is contemptible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bound books, and especially the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> at the present time, are a part of this “table of the Lord”, and we should not only read them, but attend a company meeting where they are being studied. In many companies, only a small number of those attending the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study attend the book studies. This should not be; for the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> is full of vitally important truths that are revealed nowhere else, and which we must understand to have a clear vision of the issue and the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Feed the Sheep’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only should we study at home, and attend the company studies, but we should also encourage the people of good-will to study. Having placed a book with them, we should call back to quicken further interest, and then in a kind, tactful and sincere way point out to them the need of studying the Bible with this new lielp. They, no doubt, belong to one of the three hundred and more religions of this land, not one of which has the slightest inkling of what it means to ‘rightly divide the Word of truth’. So, how can these people understand the difference between the (new) world which God so loved, ami the (old) world which we are told not to love, unless we study with them? Their salvation from impending disaster depends upon their seeing the issue, and that in turn depends upon their being able to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘rightly divide the Word of truth’, which requires study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> so well stated. ‘In order to see and appreciate the issue, and to be able ministers of the Word, those in a covenant with Him must continue to study to show themselves approved unto God . . . rightly dividing the Word of truth. In order to properly divide and apply the truth one must see and appreciate that Jehovah is God and that His name is above all others; that it has been defamed and must now be vindicated; that Christ Jesus is the great Vindicator . . . that the preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom is (1) to notify the people that Jehovah is God and that His Kingdom is here, (2) to give warning and information to those who desire to be on the side of Jehovah, and (3) to “feed my sheep”.’ To understand that requires study. And the more we study, the clearer our appreciation of the issue, the stronger our faith, the better our witness, and the greater our joy. Continuing thus we shall be approved unto God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Suggestion for Service Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">A portion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> can be used to take up fifteen or twenty minutes of your service meeting. The article on page 38, “Service in the Field,” can be used as a basic theme. The main points to be covered: Importance of being a publisher, and time in witnessing, that is, hours in the field service and ministering unto those of good-will. There are many portions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> that can be used by the various servants in the company as a basis for their remarks and illustrations on how the</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">work can be better done. No matter in what land the Lord’s people live, the methods of preaching the gospel are the same. It is not as convenient in some countries as in others, but it is necessary. Therefore all Theocratic ministers, no matter where they live, will be publishers, will put in time and will make back-calls on the interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Plan your service meetings in advance. Those who are on the program should be notified at least one week to ten days in advance, so that they can prepare their material and give the best that they can get together to the other publishers for their consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With your March </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> you will find a letter addressed to the publishers of The Theocracy. This letter calls attention to the wonderful privileges of the pioneer service. This letter should be read in your service meeting and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer </span><span class="font1">study. The publishers in the company will give this matter careful consideration. It is hoped that many will join the ranks of the pioneers beginning with the “Gau to Action” Testimony Period.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Magazine That Shows the Way to Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">With the world in sorrow, war and distress, the peoples of the earth need comfort. Jehovah's witnesses have the comfort wherewith others can be comforted. A great responsibility, therefore, falls upon the ' servants of Jehovah to see that the message of the Kingdom is proclaimed far and wide, and that the people are given an opportunity to hear. Tire </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign centers its second month in March. ; All are acquainted with the offer: The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine on the regular yearly subscription rate of $1.00, giving free a bound book and a booklet. Many new subscriptions have already been sent in to the Society, and these are being put through as quickly as possible so that tlie new subscribers will get the early issues. All persons on whom back-calls have been made during the past year should be called upon if you can reach them. It takes more initiative to serve the Lord now than it did in days gone by. It used to be quite easy to get the car out of the garage, get some gas, and drive out into the territory, but now maybe you haven’t the tires, nor do you have the gas, therefore you have to walk or take a streetcar or a bus. The problem faces every one of us. What will we do? Will we stay at home because of the hardships and extra work, or will we get out In a territory near by and serve the Lord, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Think back to the days of the Lord Jesus. He didn’t have an automobile, but he walked from city to city and from place to place. His mode of travel was not as comfortable as is ours today, even with rationing and difficulties in getting about. The apostles did the same thing, but they did preach this gospel of the Kingdom. We must do likewise in order- to defeat persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord has placed in our hands the greatest message of the day. It is a message that will bring life, peace and comfort to the groaning world of mankind. That message is contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> It is essential that we reach all the people that we can. These times, though hard, will help us to prove our integrity and show to the Lord that Ave are desirous of doing this one i thing, serving Him and doing the work right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Helpful Letter</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> goes a sample of four letters addressed “Dear Friend”. These contain some suggestions that the publishers in the company may like to use in writing to persons upon whom they have made back-calls during the past year and whom they cannot now call upon because of restrictions in travel to rurals and small towns. The publishers should write to the persons on whom they used to call regularly and tell them about this special </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign and its offer. No. 1 letter enclosed is just such a suggestion. It might be copied by many. They can sign their own names and carry on a correspondence. These people of good-will out in the country, and on the farms, should be encouraged to study. These letters may be a guide to you so as to help them. Why not. in your spare hours at home in the evening, write a letter to someone in your back-call file. This is a campaign that the back-call servant can work up, especially among the most interested ones and who have been neglected due to limited travel. The Government sees to it that the postman still gets there. Let him carry our message to these isolated people. This is the best we can do under the circumstances, and the least. Some one in your company who types well might make </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font1"> copies of this letter and pass it around to the young folks going to school and who write plainly and neatly. Let them write some letters to the various people of good-will. Keeping busy in the Lord’s service, no matter what it is, is for your own good. May the Lord bless your efforts. Make the month of March count in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. It Is hoped that well over thirty-five thousand subscriptions will be obtained in this month alone, so that our quota can be reached at the end of three months—our quota of J 00,000. Maybe a few thousand new subscriptions can be obtained via letter writing. This is no time to slack the hand, but a time to press the battle to the gate. Comfort those that mourn in this dark world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Many Shall Be Cast into Prison</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Because of faithfulness unto the Lord there are many brethren who have been east into prison. These, maintaining their integrity and desirous of keeping abreast with the Lord’s truth, will be furnished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> upon their request. Most prison regulations are to the effect that the publisher of any magazine must mail the magazine to the one in prison, and that the order for the magazine must be placed through the Commissary Department. Friends or relatives of those in prison should not send in subscriptions direct to the Society, but have the arrangement made through the prison officials. In this manner you can be assured that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> will reach those who want to study the magazine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Notice to Spanish-speaking</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">For the convenience of all Spanish-speaking brethren the Society has published two new forms in Spanish : the House to House Record (S-15S) (40c a thousand), and the Back-Call Follow-Up Report (S-3S) (free). All who need these forms may now order them direct from the Society, when sending in an order for other supplies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Call to Action” Testimony Period</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Call Is to AU</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Is the Time for Kingdom Proclamation Special Work to Be Done </span><span class="font2">In </span><span class="font1">the spring of the year planting must be done, otherwise there will be no harvest. Now the call to action goes forth from the Society, that a great planting -work may be done, so that in the months to follow the harvest may take place. The “Call to Action” Testimony Period begins with April 1, and is the last month of a three-month campaign for the obtaining of new subscribers for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine. According to all indications this campaign is progressing excellently. There are thousands of persons anxious to know the truth and to give more careful study to their Bible. The responsibility, therefore, falls upon every individual who lias made a covenant with the Lord to see that the opportunity to read is given them. The “Call to Action” Testimony Period is not just another testimony period. There is mucli important work to be accomplished. The Society has prepared a message that should be placed in every home, if possible. Will you share in this great proclamation of the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> is not going to attempt to describe to you this new booklet, nor give you its title. On the 15th of March this booklet will be mailed to every </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriber. Each one can read it, study it; and, after considering the message it contains, everyone, we feel, will be convinced that it must be placed in the hands of the people. An Invitation will go forth to every </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriber to engage in the distribution of this message. It is something that the people must know now, and, by the Lord’s grace, and with the full co-operation of the servants in the field, this message will be gotten into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first printing of this booklet has begun, and we are scheduling twelve million copies. Is it possible to distribute twelve million copies in the United States in a period of thirty days? The Lord’s organization can do it, and, by His grace, it will put forth every effort to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beginning early in March, large consignments will be going forth from the Brooklyn factory to all parts of the country, making the first shipments to the west coast. Distribution will not begin until the first day of April, but every preparation should now be made for concerted action. Have in mind that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign continues. We do not slow down on that, but, at every home at which we call, this new booklet should be left if the people promise to read it. It will also be included in the combination offered during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign, namely, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> for one year for a dollar, and we will leave with the people, free, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World, Peace— Can It Lastt</span><span class="font1"> and this new booklet. The basis for the consignments will be as follows: 100 booklets for every company publisher. Thus a company of 60 regular publishers will </span><span class="font2">receive </span><span class="font1">6,000 booklets </span><span class="font2">for </span><span class="font1">its</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>to Be in the Field</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">territory. The same ratio will be used country-wide. Pioneers, who are putting in much more time than company publishers, will be made a shipment of 1,000 per publisher. They should each be able to distribute these in a thousand homes during the month. Can such a distribution be made in one month? It can if we try. This is a “Call to Action” Testimony Period. Every regular publisher for the past year will be in the field, putting in extra time. Every irregular publisher will recognize the importance of this testimony period and will start in during the month of April. All the children and all the newly interested who are now coming to your book studies will want to join in this distribution work. A peak of publishers should be obtained during the month of April. During the “Call to Action” Testimony Period all fighters for the New World will want to be in the front ranks, serving The Theocracy, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and taking to the people that which they must have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font1"> Will you make your preparations? Are you planning to put in more than 20 hours a month during April if you have been putting in only 10 or 5? Will you be planning to put in GO hours a month if i you have been a publisher putting in 30 or 40? Every publisher for the Kingdom will be looking to the “Call to Action” Testimony</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Period, making every preparation! to increase his time, and his ability, in the serving of the great King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Twelve million booklets, along with the other work we have to do I! Can it be done? It can, by the Lord’s grace. That will mean the leaving of twelve million booklets in twelve million homes, or, if you are using it in your magazine work, you will be distributing it on the street corners at every opportunity. Back-calls will be made, evening witnessing will be arranged for, every avenue of service will be widened so that greater activity may take place in that field. Don’t wait until April to get started with witnessing I Witness during March ! Get in practice I Have your territory prepared and know what you are going to do, and, when April first comes with the “Cail to Action”, be there with all your equipment and the new publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The quota of every company publisher should be 100 booklets during the month. In regular witnessing a publisher can easily call on 10 homes during an hour. In 20 hours a month in the field service you would call on 200 homes. At least half of these homes will take the booklets. It will not be difficult to distribute them. In addition to that you have your back-call work and magazine street-work, and placements will be made regularly at all of these points. Pioneers putting in 150 hours and upward, using the same ratio of 10 calls an hour, can easily put out their 1,000 booklets. After the original consignment is made, companies that desire more booklets will place their orders with the Society. No orders for these booklets will be accepted until all the consignments have </span><span class="font2">been </span><span class="font1">shipped. Please do not order </span><span class="font2">any </span><span class="font1">early copies. All </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscribers will receive theirs through the mail.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">April 19 marks the Memorial date. By this time the “Call to Action” Testimony Period will have progressed for 19 days and, on the evening of the 19th day, all of the Lord’s people will assemble to celebrate the memorial of our Lord’s death. By this time 50 percent of your consignment will have been disposed of, and after the Memorial celebration every one will want to go forward singing the praises of the Most High and sharing in the vindication of Jehovah's name. We believe that April this year will be a very blessed month to all the fighters for the New World. In the distribution of the booklet a contribution will be taken. The people, of course, may contribute whatever they wish. If the contribution is “a promise to read”, take that! The important thing is to let them have the booklet so that they can read it. The Society, when making the consignments to the companies, will charge the companies at the rate of 75c a hundred, and the pioneers 25c a hundred, during this campaign. This rate will apply to the original consignment only. On all orders thereafter the usual rate for selfcovered booklets will apply, to both pioneers and companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let each one now carefully consider this campaign. Keep it before the Lord in prayer, and ask His direction upon that which will be done during the “Call to Action” Testimony Period. Aid your brethren so that they may see their responsibilities and share in this great proclamation of the Kingdom. A special work is to be done and, by the Lord’s grace, His people will do it to His praise. Make your plans now in every detail. More information will come forth in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Take Good Care of Records</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The new phonograph records that the Society is now having made do not have the same high-quality material in them that was previously used in records. They wear out more quickly. This is not necessarily the fault of the manufacturer. He cannot get the supplies. If we want records we have to take what we can get these days. So that the records may last longer, this suggestion is offered, and lias been proved to be correct as tried out in our testing department: Use a medium-tone, soft needle on all records from now on, in all types of phonograph. Leave the medium-tone, soft needle in the same position in the pickup for five playings. Then take it out and put in a new one. Using a soft needle makes it so that the wear is on the needle rather than on the record. When you use the long-playing chromium needle it wears out the record but not the needle. Thus it damages the record. Very good care should be taken of your records, and be sure that from now on you use the medium-tone, soft needle. These can be obtained from the Society. The packages in which these needles are sent are marked that the needle should be changed after each playing. However, you should keep in mind that the needle should be changed after each fifth playing. In the verticaltype phonograph use the medium-tone, soft needle henceforth. Put only one record on the turntable. The soft needle is longer than the chromium, hard needle. We hope this </span><span class="font2">gives longer life to your records.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Use of Study Conductor’s Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has printed a new form SC-3. A copy is enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> Companies needing new forms can place their orders now’. The charge is 40c per thousand. All study conductors, whether of a regular established study organized by the company or of a study that is started by a publisher, should fill out each month a Study Conductor's Report and turn it in to the assistant company servant. These Study Conductor's Reports should be filed alphabetically under the name of the conductor. All reports of the same conductor should be kept together; as the March, April, May, June ami July reports. These should be filed consecutively, so that they can easily be checked by the servant to the brethren. Study the form carefully, so that it will be filled out properly. Under the heading “New Interest” count those attending the study for the first time, and those who have attended a number of times but who have not as yet attended the headquarters meeting. It is from this figure under the heading “New Interest” that the company servant will get his report for the Society showing the number attending book studies that are newly interested in the work. We hope that many new book studies will be organized throughout the company territory by the company publishers, so that the people of good-will may learn the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Legal Advice</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">When brethren are convicted for violating the law, often the judge asks the defendant whether he has anything to say before judgment is passed upon him. This gives an excellent opportunity to give an additional witness. Therefore, before judgment is passed and when the invitation to speak is given by the judge, the brethren involved should take advantage of the opportunity to give as big and as full a witness as possible. This statement is generally made without limitation and cannot be interrupted and is not governed by any rules of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Time spent in jail as the result of being incarcerated on account of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom cannot be reported as time spent in the field service. However, it is proper to indicate on your monthly report card, at the bottom, in the space for additional remarks, the number of days spent in jail because of witnessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Mailing Packages</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The brethren should keep in mind that it is unlawful to mail by Parcel Post packages containing any written communication. When packages are sent by Parcel Post, all written correspondence must be sent to the Society as fibst class mail. It is permissible to glue your letter to the outside of the package and put a 3c stamp on the letter and the proper parcel post postage on the package.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Field Activity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The company activity seems to have hit a low ebb in December. There is a slight turn for the better in January, except in number of publishers; this is still very low. We are looking for a definite increase with “Jephthah’s Daughter” Testimony Period, in February.</span></p>

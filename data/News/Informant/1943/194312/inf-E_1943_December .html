<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Conquer Obstacles by the Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Declare Jehovah’s victory !” is the command given by the Ix&gt;rd as shown on the poster for December. Jehovah's servants respond enthusiastically and push ahead in the “Moue than Conquerors&quot; Testimony Period, closing out a year of victory in their work, victorious through Him 'who loved us'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year the Devil and his dupes placed before the Lord's people every conceivable hindrance, that they might become discouraged and cease their educational work. In this, as always, he failed miserably. Strengthened with admonition given by the Lord through the apostle, Jehovah’s witnesses, though they stumbled early in the year with a drop in activity, did not fall. They forged ahead and permitted nothing to interfere with their preaching the good news of Jehovah’s Righteous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December provides further opportunity to vanquish the efforts of opponents of the truth. “Follow Christ's example” is the exhortation. What was his course? He constantly resisted all compromise with religion, which would have meant departing from God's law. He refused to give up preaching for the pursuit of material things of this world. In this he conquered al! obstacles. Was that all? No I His was also a constructive work. He healed the sick and instructed in the way of life all who would hear. He taught the truth which sets men free. Above all, he fought a good fight and maintained his integrity. He did not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">merely</span><span class="font2"> conquer I He more than conquered!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">lakewise we at the present time preparing for the December Testimony Period are to follow His example. We are to conquer the continued efforts of Satan to hinder our service by persecution. We tire not to become ensnared with the cares of this life. While this does contribute to the vindication of Jehovah's name, and keeps the creature free from bondage, there is more to be done. Declare Jehovah's victory! Proclaim the truth! By continuing to do so we not only maintain our integrity, not only individually conquer hindrances, but moke than conquer by aiding those of good-will to strike off the shackles of ignorance and superstition and get on the highway that leads to the Kingdom, under the banner of truth. —2 Tim. 2 : 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has graciously shown his people how this may be done. </span><span class="font1">It's &quot;I'KEE EDUCATION I OR MEN OF </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">good-will&quot;! Using the instruments at hand, present to the people in your territory the truths of light, freedom, and lite itself, as shown in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the A'eir World,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. This offer is to be intro</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">duced with the doorstep setup, using the records as suggested in the November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the declaration accepted at the recent Assembly stated, 'all men of good-will must be located and prepared for life in the New World.' This is done by diligent working of the individual assignment, or by group witnessing. Having conquered the obstacles and devoted the time and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">effort to</span><span class="font2"> witnessing in the field, there is more to be done, as further stated in the declaration, “That in obedience to our commission we will endeavor now and in the postwar era ... to increase the number of free Bible-study classes in the homes of ‘men of good-will' throughout the earth, using the educational means which the Lord has provided for our use.&quot; This we will do by following through on all placements and using pages 375 and 376 in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> as a lead, and the “Study Questions” booklet prepared to aid in study of the book. (See November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">for details.) Thus those of goodwill will have the advantage of systematic instruction in truth, that they too may surmount the barriers of darkness and enter into life in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Witli this in mind and tlie text for the past year as our guide, be determined to be aiore than conqueror, not only of obstacles, but of the bonds of ignorance. Conquer through Cubist and the truth ! Thoroughly work your territory. Further, call back, minister, encourage study, aid in education; teach and instruct, in patience and meekness. With the power of Jehovah and Christ holding back the ■'beast&quot; from overwhelming you. do your part. Even though the weather conditions be not as favorable as heretofore, though persecution grow more intense, even though some, yes, ' the majority of the people, refuse and scorn the truth, let not that separate you from the educational work assigned to you. until all i foes, visible and invisible, are subdued.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Study “Freedom of Worship”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Meetings Made Interesting </span><span class="font2">i Realizing it to be their blessed privilege and duty to protect the people’s right to worship Jehovah God, the brethren everywhere have welcomed the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font2"> as a needed provision from Jehovah to assist them to stand fast for that freedom. Each company and pioneer publisher not already having done so should make immediate arrangements for a thorough and systematic course of ' study in this new instrument, so that the publishers, as fighters for the New World, may be fully equipped to resist the ever-increasing encroachments of the totalitarian enemies of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company should select one capable brother to conduct the series of studies in the booklet. It will be the responsibility of this brother regularly’ to conduct an Interesting and informative study of the booklet for fifteen minutes during each service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These studies will be conducted in the same manner as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies, making use of the questions that appear on each paragraph at the bottom of the page. The conductor may appoint someone to read the paragraphs to the company, but he should propound the questions himself. In many instances, because of lack of space, points are men-tinned in the paragraph that may not be clearly brought out in an; swer to the questions that appear at the bottom of the page. The conductor should be prepared to put such additional questions as lie may ’see fit to thoroughly cover each paragraph, the object being to make sure that all in attendance clearly understand the important points the text seeks to put across. This will require careful preparation beforehand, on the part of the conductor. Additionally, all scriptures cited but not quoted should be read from the Bible at the time the paragraph is read. In order that such study be instructive, each one attending , . should likewise thoroughly prepare and study the assignment In advance of the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I of the world's holidays by increasing Theocratic service. With the new provision of the question book- j let, for calling back on all bound book placements, this should not be hard to do.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">October Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report for October, the “Defeat of Persecution&quot; Testimony Period, is encouraging. The report shows an improvement over October a year ago both as to number of publishers and in average hours. And, with the exception of the drop in the number of pioneers, due to vacation pioneers’ going back to school, the October report shows improvement over that of September. By God's grace, the publishers in tlie field are defeating persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December is another campaign month. Let each publisher be alert to his privileges and opportunities and endeavor to do better than he did in October, and particularly as regards back-calls. Take advantage</span></p>

The brother may then demonstrate how the cross-examination of this woman should be conducted when the case comes to trial. A trial maybe arranged where this and other things may be rehearsed.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Good Report from Vacation Pioneers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Space will not permit us to present the many thrilling letters we have received from our younger brethren who enrolled as vacation pioneers during the past summer. These brethren really found that they could &quot;be a pioneer&quot; and meet the requirements much more easily than they ever believed possible. The joy which this realization brought them found outlets in questions such as these: “Do we have to interrupt our Theocratic sery ice to go back to school?&quot; &quot;How will our returning to school affect our record? We want to build up a record that will enable us to become special pioneers and Gilead students.&quot; These and many other questions and statements of appreciation indicated an intense desire to have an active part in life in the New World. It opened up to them a Theocratic vision ol the future that will go far to help them to properly appraise New World and &quot;old world&quot; values, and choose the way of life. In this they are setting a splendid example for many young-consecrated men and women who have no obligation or valid reason for not devoting their entire time to Theocratic service, and thus making a record that will constitute a basis for greater service in the Lord's &quot;New World” of tomorrow.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Free Nation I</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be a Regular Publisher</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">‘•Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” That stirring command went forth from Jehovah God to Zion’s King. Christ Jesus, over twenty-five years ago. That truthkeeping righteous “Free Nation” entered in. and unto such now the commission lias been given to preach ‘this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness’. The past twenty-five years' work in performance of that commission has piled up an enormous “heap of witness” and proof that it is the nation that “keepeth the truth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the recent world-wide “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly the Lord enlightened Uis people as to what is meant by ‘keeping truth’. A recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> briefly, clearly, and forcibly points this out: “They keep the truth, not by remaining silent about it, for that would mean denying the truth by letting the error stand unchallenged. They keep the truth both by being faithful to it and by telling it out to others. . . . This divine grace has not been restricted to them for their selfish enjoyment, but that they might ‘arise and shine’ and be witnesses of Kingdom truth In all the world for a witness to all nations . . . , and those ‘strangers’ of good-will who now become the companions of the remnant must likewise love the truth and must keep it by faithfully witnessing to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the month of January, 1944, the citizens of the “Free Nation”, along with their companions, will keep trutli by carrying it to others in the form of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Trutli Shall Make You Free’’</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. This is a righteous requirement of everyone under the administration of the “Free Nation”, and by fulfilling such requirement one is faithful to the truth given him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We hope that the beginning of the calendar year 1944 will mark a rise in Kingdom activity on the part of every company and unit and every individual publisher of The Theocracy. By now almost all companies have been visited two times by the servant to the brethren. He has closely examined your activity anil has called your attention to certain deficiencies that exist, both individually and as a company, and has aided you constructively that you might progress. Your acceptance of his counsel and help has been shown by increased and efficient witnessing over the past year. Expressed appreciation of the Lord's arrangement of tile “servant to the brethren” work and your 'keeping truth' thereby can be manifested to a greater degree in the coming year by your diligence in receiving Theocratic-instruction and applying such by increasing your field service activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Time Vital to Keeping Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To properly ‘keep truth&quot; one must put in a reasonable amount of time in the service. To put m that reasonable amount of time requires organization. both on the parr of the company as a whole and on the part of the individual publisher, be it company or pioneer. Be systematic and do all things in order. Budget or arrange your time, and then stick to it, and you will lie surprised at the increase you can show on your report and the blessings that will result from that increased activity. Now this means that all who have been regular publishers over the past year but who have not met the 60-hour quota should strive for it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It means that the irregular </span><span class="font2">publish-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Truth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">ers should strive to report regularly and thus be regular publishers. It means that every associated person of good-will who has been coming </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">book studies, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study and/or service meeting has an obligation before the Lord to ‘keep the truth’ by telling it to all with whom he comes in contact. If you are one of such, begin now to have a part in Kingdom service. Be a publisher I The servants and publishers will aid you to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use All Instruments</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Accept and use with diligence all instruments the Lord has put within your reach that you may bear an effective witness to His truth. Use the phonograph, especially the doorstep setup, and the abundant supply of records provided. Accept an individual assignment of territory and work it once every six weeks. Use the “House to House Record” form and keep track of all interest and placements and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fail not to call hack thereon.</span><span class="font2"> Make back-calls and organize and conduct book studies. Take advantage of your privilege to ‘forsake not the assembling of yourselves together’ and attend </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study and service meetings. Participate in the course in Theocratic ministry and become equipped to give a more effective witness. Seek not the growing temporary prosperity of the “old world”, but shake loose from all unnecessary secular shackles that hinder lasting New World service. Enter upon that highway that leads into the New World and lift up the standard of truth for the people that they too may join in its proclamation and be free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To do such means that you will have a more complete share in ‘keeping truth’. “Freely ye have received” ; rightly then, “freely give.”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Report Letter</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that an accurate record may be had of the work done in the field, it is necessary that all who engage in the campaign of free education see eye to eye on the matter of reporting. To this end a letter of instructions was prepared and sent to all companies and pioneers with their yearly supplies. This letter should be thoroughly discussed at one of tlie service meetings during December. It should also be carefully considered by all special and general pioneers, and where these are not able to attend a company service meeting they should arrange for a study among themselves, as they should also do with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> and other organization instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the reports coming in it is quite apparent that not all clearly understand how to report. For instance : &quot;Back-Call Book Studies” to be reported are a number equal to the number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">different homes or places</span><span class="font2"> where the publisher conducts bis own studies, and not the total number of meetings held. “New Interest Attending Back-Call Book Studies” includes all those who do not regularly attend </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and other headquarters meetings and who are not publishers, not merely those who attend for the first time. If there is any question as to the proper manner of reporting, it is better to write for information than to continue reporting incorrectly. In the typical Theocracy, as well as in the days of the apostles, accurate reports were made. The same should be true today.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>How to Report Back-Calls</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Keeping proper records of all people of good-will is most important. In order that the back-call records may be kept properly and accurately, and to promote uniformity in all companies in keeping these records, the following instructions are given :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a publisher places literature in the house-to-house work he makes note of this on the “House to House Record&quot; form and calls back on all of those people in a few days. Each one of these calls on people with whom you have previously placed literature, or w h o have shown interest and to whom you are now able to give an additional witness, should be reported as a back-call in the following manner: Right after the very first back-call, if there is evidence of interest and more calls should therefore be made, the publisher should make out one original “Back-Call” slip, and one “Back-Call Follow-Up Report&quot;. He should keep the original &quot;Back-Call” slip as long as he holds the territory and the party is interested, but the “Back-Call Follow-Up Report” should, at the first meeting thereafter, be turned in to the back-call servant, after the necessary information is entered on the original “Back-Call&quot; slip. Each time the publisher makes a call thereafter he will make out one “Back-Call Fol-i low-Up Report” and turn it in to the back-call servant, after entering the results of his call on the back of the original “Back-Call” slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Filing “New Interest”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the back-call servant receives “Back-Call Follow-Up Reports” for names he does not have in his permanent file, he will file them in their proper order under the territory number in his permanent file, and when he receives </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font2"> such “Back-Call Follow-Up Reports” he will make out a &quot;Permanent Back-Call Record” for his file, enter the information from the “Back-Call Follow-Up Reports” on it, and destroy the Follow-Up slips. If he receives only one or two “Back-Call Follow-Up Reports” and no more for a period of two or three weeks, he should take these slips out of his file and check with the publisher to see if the prospect has lost interest. Only one original “Back-Call” slip is to be made out by a publisher for each person on whom back-calls are made. The only exception to this would be when the back portion of a slip is completely filled out and it is necessary to have another place to continue the record of calls made. The publisher will turn in all of these with up-to-date information, addresses, etc., when he relinquishes the territory. The back-call servant will take these and cheek them with those in the permanent file and make corrections on his own records where necessary, and issue them when the territory is reassigned.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Display Only </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Poster</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">It has been noted that many companies exhibit two or more campaign posters at one time. This defeats the purpose of these posters. When the Society sends posters to the company, only the one for the current month should be displayed. At the end of each month the old one should be taken down and the new one put up in its place. Fosters are usually mailed every three months. At no time should the post</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ers </span><span class="font2">for future months be shown to anyone in the company before they </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">displayed to the company at the beginning of the respective month. These are confidential, and are to be treated as such until the time </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for their release.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> is a 64-page edition containing chiefly a report of the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, as well as very Interesting and important general information. Its description of the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly is the outstanding feature, specially prepared for you and all other people of good-will. The front page of the special section of the magazine, on the Assembly, gives one a most fascinating picture of the earth's surface, with lines stretching out from the key city at Minneapolis, Minn., and extending to five of the seven continents of the earth. To let the mind dwell on this point and call to remembrance the words of the psalmist in the 72nd Psalm, the 7th and 8th verses, one can readily discern their fulfillment now taking place before our very eyes. The people of good-will may be greatly helped by thus seeing the magnitude of the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As one turns to the third page, the beginning of the article, and follows the description of Jehovah God the Master of space, one is carried on to greater appreciation of the majesty and glory of our God, who is fulfilling his own grand design to ultimately cover the earth with a knowledge of himself as the waters cover the deep. Then comes the description of the epoch-making assembly itself as it radiated from Minneapolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every person of good-will in your territory should have his copy of this very enlightening issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation;</span><span class="font2"> not only those persons of good-will in your back-call file, but also those throughout your territory who have had any Kingdom literature. Each publisher should at all times have a number of copies in his book bag and offer them to the people in the regular house-to-house witnessing. This should be given special attention in street, route and store-to-store work. All associated with the company, whether they are publishers or not, should join in this work, placing this magazine with friends, fellow workers and acquaintances, as well as in all branches of the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If your company has not ordered its supply of this issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> or if you believe you can use an additional supply, the company servant should check immediately with the advertising servant and order a sufficient supply to be used as outlined herein. (See November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> for detailed information on this point.) Be sure your order is in the Brooklyn office before December 15, so that it can be given attention in December.</span></p>

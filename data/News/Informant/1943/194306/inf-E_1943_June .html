<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Over Five Million Booklets Placed!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">April 1 the Theocratic “Cali to Action” went out to Jehovah's witnesses and companions everywhere. 72,490 of them arose to action in tlie United States alone. Jehovah's rich blessing was upon them as they “willingly offered themselves&quot;. Tlie report shows that a new peak of GG.O79 company publishers was reached. But that's not all I Fulltime publishers also increased to the new all-time high of (&gt;,411.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">April was packed full of activity. The new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fiylitiny for Libel ty on the Home Front</span><span class="font3"> was released. To be exact, 5,493,12d booklets were distributed by tlie brethren during the one month. Besides that, 239,313 bound books were placed. And on top of that comes the amazing report of 51,147 new subscriptions obtained. The publishers accomplished all of this by devoting 1,722,119 hours in the field service. This increased time is what helped make the April report the source of joy that it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The willing and unselfish efforts of the brethren in the interests of the Kingdom are commendable and inspiring. There has never been a time of greater persecution of Christians than now ; but rigid in the face of it all Jehovah causes Uis servants to “be strong, and do exploits&quot;.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Society’s Address</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Hereafter all communications mailed to the Society should be addressed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Watchtower Bible and Tract Society 117 Adams St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brooklyn 1 N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When writing to the Society at 124 Columbia Heights, the address should be Brooklyn 2. N. Y., as this is in a different district from 117 Adams Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is required in order to comply with the request by tlie U. S. I’ost Olliee Department to facilitate the handling of mail at the General I’ost Olliee in Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Claims for Damages</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">When brethren receive literature or records in a damaged condition, please have the postmaster or the freight agent note the damage in writing. Do not give or show to the postmaster or railroad agent any invoices, but state that the claim for damage will be made by the Watchtower at Brooklyn. Then mail to the Society a letter describing the damage, enclosing the acknowledgment of damage by the carrier employed, as well as your original invoice. We prefer to start the claim here and make collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society always replaces records and books immediately on such claims, and will not make additional charge, but we must have the proper papers to make claim.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Society furnishes the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> free to all companies according to the number of publishers in the company. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> should be given to the publishers, both regular and irregular. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> sets out all the details relative to field activity, and the only ones really interested in this field activity are those who are engaged in the fieldservice work. Other persons attending meetings, who are inactive or do not go out in the service at any time, need not have copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> If you have extra copies, they can be furnished to these individuals, but the company servant should see to it that the regular and the irregular publishers receive each issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Testimony cards should be supplied to all publishers, regular and irregular. For those who profess consecration to the Lord a regular testimony card with identification printed on the back has been prepared. The consecrated should be supplied with these. For very young children and those who do not profess consecration, but want to have some part in the Lord's service, the Society has provided a testimony card that is blank on the back, and such may be had on request.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3">book what when</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">a thrill it was to receive the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World?</span><span class="font3"> Remember a great shout of joy arose the president of the Society announced its release? And then, when you began to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font3"> didn't your heart beat faster as you eagerly went from page to page and feasted upon the truths concerning the New World? Didn't it seem a most timely and comforting message amidst the confusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those same thrills and joys are being repeated daily among people of good-will. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> may not now be new to you any more, but it is to many who are just now receiving it. It is just as new to them now as it was to you last September. When it was released to you at the Theocratic Assembly the presentation was very enthusiastically made, and therefore you were more anxious to get it. Likewise, when you have the opportunity to present it to others it should be with enthusiasm, for you are giving the people something brand-new to them and that which will show them the way to life in the New World. Every time you offer the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> to the people, think about what you are actually bringing them, how happy you were when you received it, and then you will make a better presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The month of June is “The New World” Testimony Period. Very appropriately the Society has chosen the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fiyht-iny for Liberty on the Home Front </span><span class="font3">(or any other booklet), on a 25c contribution, as the literature to be offered. The main objective during June is to get </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> into the hands of the people and show them how to study it to learn how to come under the New World Government and obtain life. Let's show </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> at every door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In some parts of the country the publishers have not yet been in the small towns and rural communities with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Neu- World.</span><span class="font3"> These people too need the New World, and they will learn about it from the book. Some companies have city territory that has not been covered with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World. </span><span class="font3">For June we ought to select all the accessible territory that has not been covered with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and work it. Territory servants can check their tiles and let the publishers know where the unworked territories lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting “The New World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Experiences from the field show-that the doorstep setup method with the record &quot;The New World&quot; (I’-302) is the most effective presentation of the Kingdom message yet. It has been reported that the message on this new record holds the people in rapt attention. If you have used it you know. If you haven't, then you're missing something. Willi the warm, summer weather coming, there is every reason why all publishers having phonographs should put them to constant use in the door-to-door work. Any publishers who have phonographs they are unable to use from house to house should report that matter to the advertising servant, who will arrange to let other publishers use them during June. Every phonograph should be playing the New World message during June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you are unable to get a phonograph to use, then use the testimony card and verbal witness. Show the book to everyone. Let them look at it, and show them what’s in it. Talk </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font3"> and you’ll place it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“The New World” Follow-Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> is just the first step. All publishers should l,\ now be using the House to House Record (S-15) and thereon record every placement of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World. </span><span class="font3">This record is made so that you can follow through. The next (and more important) step is to aid those obtaining the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World to </span><span class="font3">learn what is in the book. Merely placing books with the people does not assure them of getting a knowledge of Jehovah's purposes; so the publishers that are “New World-minded” make placements with the hope of returning and eventually starting a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font3"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tact is essential in dealing with people with whom you hope to start a study. This subject is briefly dealt with in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font3"> page 04. Whenever a subject comes up that you can refer to through the index in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font3"> be sure to do it. Direct the attention of the people to the book. They will see that it contains many tilings they should know. You may have to call half a dozen times before you can even talk about the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Study Questions</span><span class="font3"> booklet; but patience is a thing the Lord’s people have learned about. Patience does not mean waiting in inactivity, but rather patiently working to the end of starting studies. Our quota is one book study per publisher. “The Nf.w World&quot; Testimony Period is the time to start a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font3"> study. Time in the New World service is the key.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Briefly, then, during “The New Would&quot; Testimony Period all New World publishers should get the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> into the hands of the people of good-will, start </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font3"> studies with them, and let everyone know about the New World and its blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Many questions have come to the oilice relative to the study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry.</span><span class="font3"> Many of them lire answered in the booklet, but were overlooked. Study pages 3 to !» ea refill ly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every publisher, male or female, will be greatly profited by attending the study of this course. It is Jehovah’s provision for all his sen-ants. According to the Scriptural arrangement, and as pointed out in the booklet, only brothers will be enrolled anil have speaking assignments. These who enroll are obligated to attend every study and participate therein. Olliers, including sisters, may attend the studies and participate in tin* discussions of the review, but only those enrolled will give talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The main purpose of this course is to make all more proficient Theocratic publishers. Brothers’ giving talks is only a part of publishing. Most publishing is done from door to door, by both men and women. Considering instruction talks and participating in the reviews will prove beneficial to sisters as well as brothers. Use of concordances, Bible dictionaries, and reference works, gathering material, how to study, coherence, tael fulness, and the many other things brought out should be understood by every Theocratic publisher. Everjone who possibly can should attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is advisable for each individual company, regardless of size, to act as an independent study group. It would not be proper for several companies to assemble together for this</span></p>

You may order booklets in even cartons, specifying whether self-covered or colored-cover. Don't ask for any particular booklets; we will give you a variety of whatever we have on hand. Blare your orders so that we can make shipments of 100 pounds or more.</span></p>

The study should lie Held regularly, each week, in all companies. 11' the student speaker of the evening Is not present, due to some cir- i cumstanee arising suddenly, then the course will continue as outlined in the booklet, without the student talk. If an occasion occurs when the instructor cannot be present, he should designate some other competent person to perform his duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in small companies where there are only two brothers, one could give a student talk, each week: thus they would each speak every two weeks. If three, four or live brothers are enrolled only one should speak, each week. In companies made up entirely of sisters the course should be carried out, with the exception of the student talks. Instruction material should be studied and a review conducted among themselves. The most capable sister or the one who conducts the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wat&lt; htower</span><span class="font3"> study should act as instructor. These sisters could look up material additional to what appears in the lessons, and many examples or illustrations may be brought out during the reviews. In small companies where there may be only Iwo or three brothers enrolled. sisters may be privileged to offer observations from (he door as to the student talk. The instructor, of course, should give final counsel on all talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Appointments of instructors in the course are being made, and companies will receive them shortly. It is suggested that while waiting for the appointment of the instructor all companies consider the material in pages .’I to 9 of the Course, devoting twenty minutes of their service meeting each week until completed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Ixird's rich blessing can readily be seen on this year's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign.

<p><span class="font3">If the brethren are arrested and baled into court for preaching the gospel, it is always necessary to offer in evidence their Identification card. To present a blank card does not accomplish the purpose for which it was intended. Even in everyday witnessing it is necessary to show your Identification card, and, in order to bear proper authority and establish your real Identitj’ and commission, this card must be properly signed. As soon as you receive your Identification card, typewrite your name at the top of the card and your address at the bottom of the card. Then sign your name in ink at the bottom of the card. This should be done neatly, and the card should always be kept clean and tidy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World publishers are alert, and they want to be ready to start July 1 with a bang 1!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;More time in the field!&quot; “Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.&quot;—Eph. 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every person who conducts a study of any kind should fill out a Study Conductor's Report (SC-3) each month. AU the information requested on the Study Conductor's Report should be given as completely as possible. The Study Conductor's Report is important because it provides information that must be reported to the Society find that is not otherwise obtainable by the company' servants from the publishers. All companies should use the latest Study Conductor's Report form, which provides space for reporting the new interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Actually there are two different uses of the Study Conductor's Report: (1) To rejHirt information on established studies for which the Society’ has appointed conductors: and (2) to report information on back-call book studies conducted by publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All Study’ Conductor's Reports must be turned in promptly at the end of each month, to the assistant company servant. The assistant company servant 1ms only three days of the following month in which to compile his report; so Study Conductor's Reports should be given to him immediately at the end of the month, if possible; otherwise, mail them to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because the assistant company servant is required to turn the Study Conductor's Reports over to the back-call servant, it will be necessary’ that the assistant company-servant keep among the company reports in his care a record of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Total number of book studies for which study conductors have been appointed by the Society;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Total number of back-call book studies conducted by- company publishers ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Total number of back-call book studies conducted by pioneers working in the company territory;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bor each of the above groups the total attendance, the total new interest, the total associated, and the total new interest attending for first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One study is counted for each Study Conductor's Report turned in. For example: If a study is conducted in the same home and with the same people four times in a month it should be reported to the Society as one study &lt;&nbsp;and four back-calls), not four studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Report the New Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company monthly report card (and pioneer, too) provides for reporting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">field serriee</span><span class="font3"> only. Therefore it would follow that, in reporting the number of studies and attendance thereat, the only figures to report would be those concerning field activity, that is, total back-call hook studies. Many companies have been including the established book studies conducted by' appointed conductors in the number of book studies reported on the monthly report card: but that is not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">field</span><span class="font3"> service. Established book studies are reported to the Society- in the company information form, but not on the mon fitly report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As to the number attending book studies to be reported, this would apply to the newly interested ones attending back-call book studios who have not commenced attendance at the company headquarters meetings regularly. Do not include the study conductor or publishers who may happen to attend back-call book studies. Just report the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">new interest </span><span class="font3">attending the back-call book studies on your company and pioneer monthly report cards. Assistant company servants will please note that the pioneers report the number of studies they conduct, and the attend</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Call Servant's Study File</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the assistant company servant has obtained the necessary information from the Study Conductor's Report slips and posted it lie will turn the slips over Io the back-call servant to tile. The back-call servant should check the reports, to see that the proper information is given. If the conductor does not fill out the report properly he should be shown the correct way. The back-call servant should check his permanent back-call tile and see if lie has received back-call follow-up slips regularly for the back-call book si miles that have been reported, and post any information that was not previously reported on follow-up slips. It would lie well to ask conductors of back-call book studies to turn in follow-up reports if they </span><span class="font1">j </span><span class="font3">have not been doing that. The buck-call servant should try to assist Ilie publishers in every manner possible to increase the study activity, and when he notices some reports indicate a downward trend in attendance or a decrease of studies lie should consult with the publishers and assist them in any way he can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the Study Conductor's Report slips from appointed study conductors and back-call studies should be filed under the name of the study conductor, alphabetically. The reports should be in monthly order under the name of the conductor, for each study he conducts. When a publisher conducts more than one study, the reports for each study should be kept together in monthly order. Thus, if a publisher conducts four studies, there would be four groups of Stud.v Conductor's Report slips filed under his name. The report slips may be clipped together with paper clips for each study, or placed in envelopes with the name of the publisher conducting the studj’ on the front. By filing in this manner the company servant, back-call servant, and servant to the brethren, or any other servants who have occasion to cheek up on book studies, can readily see who conducts book studies, how many each publisher conducts, and which publishers need the most assistance in study work. Study Conductor's Report slips should be kept for at least one year.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Personal Cleanliness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Erom time to time reports come to the Society's office regarding some few brethren who are not very presentable and. in some cases, who actually lack in personal cleanliness as they participate in the Eord's service and associate with the Eord's people. This is unforlunate indeed. Such brethren actuall.v practice an injustice upon their brethren who have to assemble with them at studies and meetings, and are a cause of stumbling many people of goodwill who. not knowing the Truth, are inclined to judge the value of the message by the appearance of the messengers. Eo\e for the Eord, love for one's brethren, and love for the Kingdom, therefore, should induce each one to be clean in body, clean in apparel, as well as clean in mind and doctrine, in order to prop-erly represent The 'Theocracy. Eet all representatives of the New World Theocracy, therefore, conduct themselves in this respect as becoming proper representatives of the New World.</span></p>

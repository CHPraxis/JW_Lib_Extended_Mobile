<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Bible-and-Booklet Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom activity of the Lord’s people during the month of May comes under the heading of “Wielding the ‘Sword of the Spirit’ ”. Tliis is the I .ord's direction for our activity during that month, and each and every one of His people should endeavor to do as He directs to the extent of “his several ability”. Placing the Bible in the hands of the people is one way of “wielding the ‘Sword of the Spirit’ ”, but placing an understanding of the Bible as contained in the literature which the Lord is providing for our distribution now is an even more effective way of “wielding the ‘Sword of the Spirit’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As announced in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> the No. 10, Watchtower Bible, the “Sword of the Spirit”, was to have been released to the public during the month of May. However, circumstances beyond our control, limitations in material, and other restrictions, make it necessary for us to limit this distribution to the people of good-will and those who are interested in the truth with whom we are conducting back-calls. Therefore the distribution of the “Sword of the Spirit” during this campaign is to be limited to these people by all pioneers and company publishers. The Lord is fully cognizant of all conditions and has evidently permitted this situation to develop for some good purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Limited Distribution of “Sword of the Spirit”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society will, therefore, be compelled to reduce most of the orders for Bibles coming to the office. No pioneer can be supplied with more than one carton, 30 in a carton (if we are able to supply him with that many), and company orders will have to be reduced to about one Bible per publisher. If you find that your order has been reduced do not expect to get the remainder of the order at a later date, but know that that is all we are able to supply you with at the present time and govern your campaign accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of this condition it seems to be the Lord's will that His people push with greater vigor and enthusiasm the distribution of the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front.</span><span class="font1"> This message is of vital significance at this time and it is very important that it be placed In the hands of as many people as possible along with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Few World. </span><span class="font1">Many companies and pioneers found it impossible to cover all their territory during April. The new booklet contains a message vitally important to every person in this country. It must be delivered to them. Therefore every regular publisher and every person of good-will assembling at back-calls and book studies should be encouraged to have a part in this booklet distribution, especially if you have not placed all jour consignment with the people in April. Supply 25 or 50 booklets to those of good-will who live in rural sections you cannot reach due to rationing, and get all your territory covered. We can still supply booklets; so order more if you need them. This will replace the distribution of the Bible during the month of May except, of course, in the back-call work. All will readily see that the placing of this message in the hands of the people is “wielding the ‘Sword of the Spirit’ ” in its most absolute sense, because it is enabling them to understand and prove these things which are contained in their own Bible. This booklet should be left in each home if at all possible, on a contribution of a few pennies if the people are able to contribute. If interested and unable to contribute it may be left with them free upon their promise to read it. We had a good supply of Bibles, but your orders were too heavy and took them all. Keep reordering Bibles when you need them, along with other supplies, and we will ship you some as long as we can keep them in stock. We trust some restriction will be lifted so that larger quantities can be produced and you can use them in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">No Limit on Publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every person active in Theocratic service during April should be likewise busy during May, and many new<sup>T</sup> ones can be added. The lack of Bibles should in no wise limit publishing. Be sure to place your share of the Bibles and, while doing so, put out booklets without limitation. Paper may be restricted in use, but time in the service is not. Be a publisher, aid the new publishers, and all together let us ‘wield the “Sword of the Spirit” ’ mightily during May.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Another Aid</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This new instrument provided by Jehovah and so enthusiastically received at the “Call to Action’’ Assembly. the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font1"> is indeed splendid. The complete instructions on how this course should be conducted are set out in the forepart of the booklet. Every Theocratic minister should equip himself with a copy of this new publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">School Instructor</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies desiring to participate in the Course should immediately make recommendation of two publishers, brothers, whom they believe best qualified to act in the capacity of school instructor, as outlined on page 9 of the booklet. Recommendations for school instructor should be written out on a letter separate from all other matters. Mark this</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Interest Is There; Find It</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The response from the interested throughout the country to the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front </span><span class="font1">has exceeded our expectations. The importance of the message, of course, cannot be overstated, and it seemed to be the Lord’s will to send a copy of this booklet to every </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriber In the United States. This was done, and a letter' was enclosed Inviting those who were interested in the issue of The Theocracy to have a part in the service by ordering some of these booklets and distributing them among their neighbors, friends, and acquaintances. There have been approximately 6,(100 replies to date, requesting booklets and agreeing to distribute them. In practically all cases this represents people other than those associated with a company organization and gives us some idea of the amount of real interest that exists in the field and needs attention. The interest is there; it is a privilege to find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Intensify May’s Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The campaign for the month of May is, as announced in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> the ‘Wielding of the “Sword of the Spirit” and in no better way can this be done than by placing in the hands of the people a clear presentation of the fulfilled prophecies of the Lord today. Such a message is contained in the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front.</span><span class="font1"> Of course, the book</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Monthly Report Cards</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">It will greatly facilitate the handling of the monthly reports if company servants and pioneers will simply place a penny stamp on the card and forward it direct to this office without enclosing it in an envelope with other mail. Your cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">letter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Attention Service Desk.</span><span class="font1"> Appointments will be made as soon as conveniently possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the school instructor has been appointed, then the brothers in the company who wish to may enroll with him, and the enrollment will be in accordance with page 6 of the booklet. Pioneer brethren associated with companies may be enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Appointments will be made only upon receipt of a recommendation by the committee. No appointments will be made for groups of pioneers; but only for companies. Where there is a group of pioneers in isolated territory, not associated with a company, they should arrange to meet together once a week, selecting one of their group to act in the capacity of instructor, and go over the Course. Since pioneer groups are not permanent arrangements, no school instructor will be appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Few World</span><span class="font1"> should always be included with the booklet wherever possible and the Bible placed in the hands of the people of good-will at back-calls so they can share in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There have been fourteen million of these new booklets printed and sent out to you brethren in the field. All indications are that they are being absorbed very rapidly by the people; and this in Itself is definite proof that the Lord’s time for placing such a message in the hands of the people is now. Let everyone, therefore, be on his toes to increase his time in the field during the daylight hours, evening work with the booklets and back-calls, magazine work on the streets presenting the booklet with the magazines, so that everyone everywhere may have an opportunity to consider the issue presented in tliis booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Late Subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brethren who have prospective subscriptions but were unable to get them during the month of April for one reason or another, may continue accepting such subscriptions during the month of May and placing the premium of a bound book with the people. There may be many back-call interests and others who were not in position to obtain the subscription during the assigned period. In that event they will have an opportunity during the month of May to avail themselves of this provision. The subscriptions may be forwarded here during the month in the usual manner.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>March Field Activity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The activity for the month of March still leaves much to be desired in the way of all-out participation in the &quot;new world” service. That is particularly true in the case of company publishers, both in the number participating ami in hours in the field and number of back-calls made ; all are particularly low. Don’t let the things of this world crowd out your blessed privileges of service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘cause the Days Are Evil” i. 5:16</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">companies. The Society would like to get this literature into the hands of the foreign-speaking people; therefore you can dispose of your stock on whatever contribution you can get, and the Society will credit your account for whatever literature is placed, upon receipt of your request, as well as send you more free foreign literature. Pioneers living in company territory can participate in this free distribution of the company stocks, and if pioneers need any foreign-language literature they should consult with the company servant and place a joint order. Since this literature will not be charged to any account, only one order should be sent in from any company for foreign-language publications. Pioneers and companies should order together and divide up the literature when the shipment is received. This will save shipping costs and work. We do not want to mail these orders, nor send them by express. We want to make freight shipments of 100 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the past year there have been large numbers of foreignspeaking people shifting from one city to another because of their occupations ; therefore the servants in the companies should try to ascertain during May and June where these foreign-speaking people live. Do that, and get your orders in as early as possible. Be sure to put out all your old foreign-language literature in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">English Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneers should place all the five oldest bound books mentioned above that they have in stock. Do not order any of these five English bound books from Brooklyn for the campaign. We cannot fill orders for these, as our stock is practically depleted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">English booklets may be ordered. Use the regular order blank and merely state number of cartons of assorted booklets you desire. Order only by full cartons, but make it 100 pounds. Do not ask for any particular booklets; only state whether you want colored-cover or self-covered. We will ship you whatever we have on hand. These will be charged to the company account in the usual manner, and a credit will be issued following the campaign for what you place during July, as stated hereinafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Order of Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Place the oldest literature first. To know which are the oldest publications, just check the copyright dates on the front pages. All the old large-size booklets should be disposed of, if you have any left. Probably the only ones of these you have are in the foreign languages. Also get olf your shelves and into the hands of the people all the regularsize booklets, using the oldest ones first, such as HVicrc </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Are the Dead! Keys of Heaven, Home, and Happiness, Health and Life,</span><span class="font1"> etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Campaign Credits</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the close of the campaign proper adjustments will be made in your accounts so that you will be credited for all the foreign-language literature you placed free from your stocks and which were previously charged; but you will not request credit for the free literature you received from the Society. Adjustments will be made crediting your accounts, according to your requests,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribute All Foreign-Language Literature and Old Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The month of July is a month in which all the company publishers and pioneers should put forth an extra effort to get in more time in the field and 'redeem time’. In other words, spend less time in doing the non-essentials. Do not let your daily work and occupation infringe on your time that should be devoted to the preaching of the gospel and in the interests of the Kingdom. So that this may be one of your busiest months in the year, the Society has arranged a special campaign. It will be a month devoted to the distribution of all of the older foreign-language and English literature that we have in stock. In other words, we want to clear the shelves and put the message where it belongs—in the hands of the people. This applies to all the older literature. That will be a big task; hence the need of redeeming the time, especially during July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Variety of Special Offers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Foreign-Language Litebatube : All literature except the latest bound book and latest booklet, in all languages </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.rcept</span><span class="font1"> Spanish, to be distributed free or on any contribution the people wish to offer. Use the oldest publications first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">English Litebatube : Offer includes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, </span><span class="font1">and all booklets except </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front, Peace—Can It Last! Hope,</span><span class="font1"> and model study and question booklets. Offer any two bound books on a 25c contribution: 17 booklets on 25c contribution; one book and 8 booklets, 25c: 7 booklets, l()c. You may also combine any two of the above combinations if you wish to make a larger presentation. Use up the oldest booklets first. The sevenbooklet combinations should include three colored-cover booklets and four self-covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Primary Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most important offer during the month of July will be the free foreign-language literature (except Spanish). Last year the Society put on a campaign to dispose of much of the foreign-language literature it had on hand for shipment to foreign countries. Knowing that it would be impossible to make these shipments for some time to come, we tried to dispose of as much as we could in this country. A splendid witness was given, but not all the people were reached. We still have some of this on hand and would like to put the remainder in the hands of the people this July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">there is an order blank for free foreign-language literature only. You should order' what you think you can put out during July only. No charge will be made for this literature to the companies. Whatever contributions you receive you may send to the Society as contributions at the close of the campaign. Pioneers, however, may retain the contributions they receive for this literature. This order blank should be sent in along with other orders for other literature, particularly English booklets for the July campaign. It is observed that there are approximately 80,000 foreign-language bound books and 250,000 foreign-language booklets in stock at the</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Use Your School Vacations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Last summer there were many of the school-age publishers who enjoyed full-time field service during the summer months, working with their parents or other older pioneer publishers. Again this summer the same privilege of service is extended to these publishers, as well as many more who may wish to enjoy a summer of Theocratic activity. All juvenile publishers are urged not to waste their time this summer, but to spend as much of it as possible as Theocratic publishers. Those who van put in pioneer hours are invited to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Consecrated young publishers who wish to enter the pioneer service for the summer should begin planning now for that work. If one of your family is a pioneer you may work with him and use his literature. If none of your family is a pioneer, then perhaps you can arrange with a pioneer working in your company to work with him. If you can, send for a pioneer application and you will be enrolled on a special list for the summer months. No account will be opened at Brooklyn, but you should obtain your literature through a local pioneer. It means devoting at least 150 hours a month in the witness work. If you can make the arrangements to do that, send for a pioneer application and full particulars. If not, then put in as much time as you can with the company. However, why not he a pioneer at the convention in August?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on the placement of English bound books from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font1"> to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font1"> inclusive, as well as the booklets. The English booklets that you order from the Society for this campaign will be charged to you at the regular rates, and you will make request for credit at the end of July. A special credit request form will lie sent you with the June </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> This form will provide for requesting credit on all English and foreign - language literature placed during July. Full credit will be allowed on foreign-language literature placed out of company or pioneer stocks. Companies will receive a credit of 9c per bound book and 2c per colored-cover booklet. Pioneers will not be credited on English publications used. If any companies wish to absorb the costs of distributing the free literature they need not send in the credit request form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in mind that distribution of foreign-language books and booklets applies to all languages except Spanish. Any Spanish literature you have on hand in your stock, do not distribute at the special rate; you may place this at the regular rates only. There is no excess of Spanish literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Alternative Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If jou run out of foreign-language literature before the end of July and cannot get some from a near-by company, and if you place all your stock of English books Included in the special offer, then you may place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> or other late books at the regular 25c contribution along with the latest booklet. If you have sullicient older booklets you may wish to offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World </span><span class="font1">and 8 booklets on a 35c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Don't let anything hinder you from finishing out the month of July with your best hours yet. In July make an extraordinary effort to devote all the time possible and reach a new individual peak in hours of Theocratic service. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Remem</span><span class="font1">ber the long daylight evening hours as well as Saturday and Sunday. Find the people of good-will, get the literature into their hands, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">get them ready to attend the convention in August. Clear the stock shelves by August 1. Much time will be required to do that; so redeem it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Pioneers Needed in Large Cities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">If you have hesitated about entering the full-time field service because gasoline rationing restricts your travel, don't let that hold you back any longer. The Society suggests you come to the cities, particularly in the eastern part of the United States. In the cities of New Y<sup>T</sup>ork, Chicago, Philadelphia. Detroit, Cleveland, Washington, St. Louis, Baltimore, Boston, and Pittsburgh there are well over 19 million people. All of these cities are not now being thoroughly given the witness, and all lend themselves well to pioneer service. Take New York city for an example. More than seven million people live in Greater New York city, but there are only about two thousand companj’ publishers working in that large territory. There are more people in New York city than in some whole countries. such as Sweden, Switzerland, and many others. But there are comparatively few publishers to do the work. Transportation is no problem. A person can go to almost any part of New York city for only a five-cent fare. New York city alone could use at least 500 more pioneers, not to mention the needs of the other' cities mentioned above. City territory is workable all year round ; so why not select a city, forget about gasoline rationing, and be a pioneer? Have you considered the pioneer service?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">During ‘'The New World&quot; Testimony Period, which is the month of June, the literature to be used will be the bound book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World </span><span class="font1">and a self-covered booklet, on a 25c contribution. In April and May considerable emphasis will have been placed upon the distribution of booklets.

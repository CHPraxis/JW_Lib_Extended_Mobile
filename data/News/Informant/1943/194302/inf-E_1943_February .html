<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>and Keep Pace</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">At last it is here! And all the evidence points to the fact that this will be the greatest campaign yet! Jehovah's people are at full unity. Clearly the blessing of Jehovah is upon His Theocratic organization, causing a greater witness for the name of Jehovah and contributing to the final victory of the Greater Jephthah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jephthah’s only daughter rejoiced exceedingly in the great victory Jehovah granted her father over the demon-worshiping eneroachers. She willingly compiled with the terms of the vow Jephthah had made. It was not her will be done. Glad was She for the prhilege of devoting herself wholly and unselfishly in the Lord’s service. Jephthah’s daughter loved Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fulfillment of this prophecy today is inspiring. We see thousands of those who were foreshadowed by Jephthah’s daughter, the &quot;Jona-dabs”, joyfully responding and readily accepting the Theocratic arrangement, willingly offering themselves in unselfish Kingdom service. The vow has been made. All fruitage of the victory goes to the praise of Jehovah. Now let all Theocratic publishers, remnant and “.Tonadabs”. render zealous and untiring efforts in service during February, seeking out more of the “Jephthah’s daughter” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The offer is the subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for one year on the contribution of $1.00, to which will be added as a premium the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font4"> If someone has </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> you may substitute any other bound book. If you find someone is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriber already, then offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> under the same arrangement. Where people are unable to contribute for the yearly subscription, offer a sixmonth subscription on the contribution of 50c, with a booklet free, without a book. Then, if necessary you can drop down to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World </span><span class="font4">and the latest booklet at 25c, or three booklets for 1&lt;)c. or, finally, one booklet for whatever they are able to give, or free if they will read it. Remember, too, tlie foreign-language subscriptions. Sample copies may be obtained. An effort should be made to leave the Kingdom message in some form with all who are desirous of reading it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have record P-302 (“The New World&quot;) should introduce the special offer with that, using the doorstep setup. If you don’t have that record, use the ones you have. If you can use the phonograph introduction, do so: but if you don’t have access to a phonograph, use the testimony caril provided by the Society for tins campaign, one of which for eacli publisher is enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the next three months offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">to all your neighbors, friends, merchants, and all whom you meet, as well as those in your individual territory. Doing this will help you to make your Quota. The quota for tills campaign is 109.(100 new subscriptions. If you are a pioneer you should get at least one subscription a week; if you are a company publisher you should obtain at least one new subscription a month. Every company should set its own quota on that basis, and push this campaign. Each week a check should be made to see that your company is up to iis quota. Each individual publisher should check to see that he is up to his individual quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To reach this easy quota each publisher should start on February 1 and go after subscriptions. Don't wait until late in February before you start and then wonder wliy you haven't done as well as some other publisher. Everyone can make his part of the quota if he puts (lie first thing first. Those of good-will want the truth now as never before. There is no better time than now for a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. We are in a better position than ever before. We have had the opportunity of becoming well organized into a trim fighting unit under the new Organization Instructions. Many have had the benefit of counsel and suggestions given by the servants to the brethren. By now every regular publisher should have an individual territory that has been worked with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kinadom News</span><span class="font4"> and followed up with the phonograph ami publications, as well as back-calls on those of good-will. Having used the House to House Record slip, you are now familiar with where the interest is in your territory. The preliminary details have been ironed out. For the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign the stage is set! Let’s all do our part and share in another victory for the Greater Jephthah!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“The New World” Record Prepared</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Peace—Can It Last?” also Being Made</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The three lectures delivered over the hookup from Cleveland Public Auditorium in September were recorded at that time; namely, “The i Only Light,” &quot;Fighters for the New World,” and “Peace—Can It Last?” For tlie past four months the Society has been trying to have these manufactured, and. although materials for manufacturing records are very scarce, delivery within tlie next few weeks has been promised. Tlie supply is very limited: therefore we suggest that companies or pioneers desiring to have these records for use in back-calls should order just tlie number that they can use of the series “Peace—Can It Last?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to the lectures “Fighters for the New World” and &quot;The Only Light”, only sufficient pressings are made that each company can have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> set. That is all you should order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Introductory Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A record introducing the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> has been prepared by the president of the Society. Tlie Society was fortunate in getting a quantity of these made (approximately 25.00(1). This means that only those persons who will put the records to constant use should order them through the company. The number of the record is P-301, P-302 ; and, when ordering these, put them on the same order blank with literature that you will need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To lessen the possibility of breakage. it is advisable that records be packed with books in regular freight shipments. When sent by express or parcel post the breakage is greater. Wherever possible all companies and pioneers will please include their order for these records witii their freight orders for books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please keep in mind when ordering these new records that the Society can ship immediately the record “The New World” (P-301, P302) ; but the other records, the three lectures, should be ordered on a separate order blank with nothing else and sent in at tlie same time and this will be held on file until such time as the records come into stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the great scarcity of records, please do not order records that will be put on the shelves and not used regularly. Order only what you must have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Only Light” (P-293 to P-302). $3.00; &quot;Fighters for tlie New World” (P-303 to P-31G). $4.00; “Peace—Can It Last?&quot; (P-317 to P-330), $4.00; “The New World” (P-301, P-302), 50c. Pioneers ordering P-301, P-302 with literature may get one disc free, up until April 1. Pioneers should order with groups when possible; and if you can keep a set of &quot;Peace—Can It Last?” busy you can have it charged on your account and it will be applied against the credit you requested on your Certificate of Credit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Make More Back-Calls</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Conduct More Studies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">It is clearly understood by all the Lord's consecrated ones that the important thing in their lives is serving the Lord; therefore the thing uppermost in their minds is how they can increase their activities and improve their service to the Most High. The report for the year 1942 shows that the Lord has crowned it with his blessing and made it the greatest year of service up to the present time. This brings great joy to all New World fighters, and none of them wish to rest on their “laurels'’ and slow down now. All are stimulated to far greater activity than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The back-call and book-study work is the most important phase of the Lord's service at this time and should be concentrated upon by all publishers of the New World. It is primarily at back-calls and book studies that the people learn of God’s purposes and are instructed and “fed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Consider 1943 “Yearbook”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This subject is of so great importance that the Society hereby advises every company of Jehovah's witnesses to set aside part of at least one service meeting during the month of February and consider the article “Back-Calls and Book Studies”, page 47 in the 1943 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearhook.</span><span class="font4"> This assignment should be given to some capable brother in the company and he should be prepared beforehand to give an interesting and instructive talk on this subject. The speaker should study this article </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thorouyhIy</span><span class="font4"> and give it in his own words—it is not intended that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> l.e read in the service meetings The st taker could have a brief out'ino of the material he would present to the company, and give it orally. Here tire a few of the things that should be stressed by the speaker in this presentation : the necessity of making back-calls and conducting book studies, the advantages of the back-call and bookstudy work over other features of the service, the Important part that the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font4"> plays in the back-call and book-study work, the results of the back-calls and book studies, and the urgent necessity of making more back-calls and conducting more studies now, particularly in connection with the present </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign. He may also compare the average increase in the back-call work of the country with the increase of the local company and point out where the publishers may make many improvements over last year’s activity. A few scriptures could be used to prove various important points. Additional material having direct bearing upon this work may be taken from other publications of the Society if needed for further emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everyone who attends your book studies and upon whom you call back is a potential </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriber. Every attention and consideration should be given these people. Every person whose name is in your back-call file should be called on with tills special offer. Do not fail to offer the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription to all those with whom you may come in contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DRAFT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After February 1 all Selective Service registrants (18 to 45) must carry on tlieir person their original registration and classification cards. Anyone not having classification should go to liis board ami ask for card. Failure to carry said cards subjects one to heavy penalty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Chart Being Sent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Current Poster</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All Theocratic publishers are very much interested in having a part in making their respective companies more progressive. We all want to see the Kingdom work increase to the honor of Jehovah’s name. There are certain features of the work for which the publishers are directly responsible and which they can control. Progressive publishers want to know whether their company is increasing in these things. So that every company publisher may know j exactly what is being done in his company each month in these vitally important features of the Kingdom service, the Society has prepared a chart, which is being mailed free of charge to each company. This chart is printed on heavy paper and will be sent separate from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font4">in a roll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chart is headed, ‘'This Gospel of the Kingdom Shall Be Preached&quot; ; which is Matthew 24: 14. There are seven columns on the chart, headed as follows: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'lotal Publishers, Total Hours, Arcrage Ilouis per Publisher, Total Back-Calls, Average Back-Calls per Publisher. Total Book Studies,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Average Studies per Publisher.</span><span class="font4"> These are the most important parts of the Kingdom work today. At tlie left-hand side of the chart the months are listed for the service years of 11)43 &gt;&nbsp;and 1944, beginning with October ' 1942, and the chart provides space j for a comparison between I he two | years. Space for posting the company quota is also allowed, as well as a place for the year totals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Along with this chart you will find sheets of numbers, some red and some black. These numbers are i printed on gummed paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Use It</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chart should be in the care of the assistant company servant. It is in two sections and will have to be pasted or glued together at the proper point. If you visit to do so you may paste or mount it on wall board to make it more durable, having in mind, that it should last for two years. The chart should be posted in the company Kingdom Hall or headquarters meeting-place. Every company, regardless of size, will find it advantageous to use this chart. Keep your chart neat and clean and avoid smudges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The numbers printed on the gummed sheets should be neatly cut apart in strips. Use black numbers for this year, saving the red for next year. Care should be taken in cutting these strips, so that they will all be of the same width. If the numbers are cut out properly they will all be of the same .size, and then your chart will look much neater when you paste the numbers on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assistant company servant should immediately post on this chart the quota for the company for the fiscal year 1943 and all the activity reported for the months of October, November and December 1942, and January 1943. At the end I of each month hereafter when the j report for the company is made up j the assistant company servant should j post the report on this chart. In j figuring the averages it is only necessary to use tenths, the same as the Society does in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> Decimal points are on the number sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> each month will contain a summary of the report for the United States as it does now. </span><span class="font5">At </span><span class="font4">least ten minutes of a service meeting once each month should be devoted to a comparison of the company activities with the report for </span><span class="font5">the United States as a whole.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Whether you are keeping up with your quotas should also be discussed, using the chart. Keep up your chart and keep up your progress. Remove all other charts from the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Posters</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the chart you will find two posters: one is for February and the other for March. On February 1 the January poster should be taken down and the February postin’ put up. Don't put up the March poster until March 1, and then take February's down. Have only one poster up at a time. Use the current poster as shown by the Calendar.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Territory Outline</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> you will find a new territory outline form. A number of changes have been made in this outline to conform to the new Organization Instructions. The company servant and territory servant should study it carefully and adjust your company setup accordingly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Filling Your Orders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the uncertainty of the times many Hems are out of stock and there is a possibility that they will not be in stock soon : so, when you receive an invoice and find that items you ordered are not listed thereon, consider them out of stock. You can reorder them in a month or two: but please do not virile the Society asking why you did not receive such items, as this means unnecessary &lt;’orresponden&lt;’e. We will always send to jou vhat you order if we have it. Watch Ihe </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> for announcement of new publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever company service report forms are required by pioneers who are working in company territory, they should be obtained from the local company organization. That will save in shipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Remitting with Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cash items are those items that cannot be charged to any account unless you have a credit balance on your account. A remittance to cover must accompany all such orders. ‘‘Cash items” includes everything handled by the Society except Bible No. 10 and books and booklets for field service campaigns. This campaign literature may be charged to company or pioneer accounts, only, however, when the accounts are in good condition and regular monthly remittances are being made thereon. </span><span class="font5">A </span><span class="font4">down payment of at least 25 percent must accompany all orders for English phonograph records.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">An examination of the activity of tlie pioneers and companies for the month of December shows a very deeided drop in all branches of the work. The drop is more pronounced in the middle western and the eastern states, such as Missouri, Iowa. Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania. New York, Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gas rationing, of course, placed some restriction upon the activity of the Lord's people, but this does not seem to lie the real cause, as the 17 eastern states that had gas rationing for several months show just as decided a drop as the other sections of the country where gas rationing commenced on December 1. Gas rationing, winter weather, </span><span class="font5">floods, or </span><span class="font4">anything else, should never </span><span class="font5">be permitted to impede the progress</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">of the Lord’s people. This is something to overcome. Be more than conquerors, rather than permit such ‘‘old world” limitations to interfere in any wise with the New World activity. The company servant and other servants, particularly the as-sistant company servant and back-</span></p>

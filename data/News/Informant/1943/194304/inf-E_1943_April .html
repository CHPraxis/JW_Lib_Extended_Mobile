<p><span class="font3">By now the new booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front— </span><span class="font3">Freedom-Lovers Thrown to the Lions, has been received by all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers. Have you read your copy twice? Yes, at least twice. If not, then set aside an hour and read it aloud with expression. It contains a message so powerful that it must be heard to be appreciated. Read it aloud, and give it the emphasis and the force that its thoughts require. It will thrill you through and through and give you an appreciation not otherwise possible. Besides, reading aloud is good training for all Theocratic ministers. See Nehemiah 8 : 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If, after reading it aloud, you are not filled with joy and gratitude that Jehovah has given us a powerful and timely instrument; if you do not feel inspired to do your best to place your quota of one thousand booklets if you are a full-time publisher, or a hundred booklets if you are a company publisher, then the apostle's words apply to you : “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light” (appreciation). —Eph. 5: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It can be said without exaggeration that the Society has never published a finer, more powerful and more timely booklet. From its thrilling opening sentence to its closing words of comfort, it holds the undivided attention of the reader, as in masterly fashion and with telling effect it ties together the fight for liberty with the Word and the true worship of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words appearing on the Liberty Bell, “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof,” were not taken from some statesman from ancient Greece, “the cradle of democracy,” but were uttered at God's command by Moses, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who was used to bring liberty to the Israelites. Because Christ Jesus, while on earth, preached the truth which was to set men free, the religionists of His day became so incensed that they called upon the bloody arm of Roman imperialism, and “the greatest crime in all history followed, the foulest misdeed in the unlovely career<sup>-</sup> of religion, the dastardly murder of the Son of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And who are the fighters for liberty today? ‘The ones who are in the thickest of the fight for liberty, and who are the very spearhead against totalitarian aggression . . . are that minority of international unpopularity, Jehovah’s witnesses.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The invisible enemy of liberty, and his purpose, have never been so clearly portrayed, while regarding his chief instrument on earth we read: “Everything of human society and Statecraft the Hierarchy leavens with its leaven of Catholic infiltration, meddling and propaganda . . . that system of priestcraft lusting and grasping for power and more power, until the world is theirs. . . . It is the most totalitarian and oppressive of any organization ever on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Aftei<sup>-</sup> giving a survey of the progress that this enemy of liberty has made, from the beginning of the Fascist regime to the banning of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">on November 2, 1942, in Great Britain, the booklet sounds the note of warning. This enemy of liberty will move on from its encroachments on that bated and despised minority, Jehovah's witnesses, to the larger encroachments on all others, for “the liberty of one or of a minority means, in the end. the liberty also of the majority and of all”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But let all the lovers of liberty take heart; for ‘this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached until the end come’. “Not the end of Jehovah's witness, but the inglorious end of the [wicked] nations.” Therefore “the fight for liberty to worship and serve Jehovah God will go on, with greater intensity and courage, and multitudes of persons of good-will are due to see which is the side of truth, righteousness and victory and will take their stand there, fearlessly and immovably.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord having provided us with this remarkable instrument, which is in itself a call to action, let us go forth with zeal and enthusiasm and spread it far and wide. “The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy?”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Pioneer Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed witli this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">there is a letter addressed to all company publishers, laying before all the great privilege of full-time service. This is a “Call to Action”: an invitation to all of these to examine themselves and see if they cannot so arrange their affairs as to devote all their time to the interests of the New World and sever their connections as much as possible from the 'old world’.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Paper Restrictions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">By Government order all publishers must use less paper during the coming year in the publication of magazines and other printed matter. This restriction affects our magazines considerably. The Society therefore requests that all companies handling distributors’ copies order the exact number they need of each issue. Where you find that you have five or ten copies left over at the end of the month you should reduce your orders. It is better to run out of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">than have any left, because of the pajier shortage. If company servants and advertising servants will carefully check their requirements and correct their orders it will not be necessary for the Society to reduce your order. We want to keep you supplied as long as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ ‘Hallelujah !’ that is, ‘Praise ye Jehovah!’ It is his urgent call to his favored ones to action. The faithful spring to the response.” Thus ends the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> article entitled “The Song-Call to Action”. Here we have the theme for our April Testimony Period, the third and final month of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">Campaign which is featuring a year's subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and a booklet, on a contribution of one dollar. And what cause for praising Jehovah by taking part in the field service! The special campaign offer (to which has now been added </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the new booklet Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front),</span><span class="font3"> the “Call to Action” Assembly, and the Memorial. all in one month!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, to all—those fully appreciating their privileges and pressing the battle to the gate, those who have momentarily slacked their hand, as well as those who have associated themselves with the Lord's people but have yet to go out for the first time—comes the clarion</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">clear CALL TO ACTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Will you be among the faithful who </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">spring</span><span class="font3"> to that call with the very first day of April and continue with zeal until the last day? April should see each publisher making his quota of subscriptions. Have you reached yours? If not. examine yourself as to where the fault lies. Have you diligently engaged in the house-to-house work? Have you made back-calls on all those of good-will whose names you have? During April all these persons in unassigned territories should be given the opportunity to take advantage of the special offer. Have you availed yourself of this provision to make your quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">April should also see a new peak in publishers; for every </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">subscriber has been sent not only a copy of the new booklet but also a letter showing him the privilege and the importance of having a share in the further distribution of this booklet. Therefore call on all your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers whose names are in your back-call files; aid them to become publishers during April by having a part in the distribution of this timely message. This they can do by placing the booklet in the street work, as well as by going from house to house. Remember. the booklet is to be left in every home if at all possible, on any contribution they may be able or willing to offer, a penny or two, or even the promise to read. By everyone doing his part a new peak in publishers will be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And as our placements reach the halfway mark of our quotas by the middle of the month, we will be preparing to attend the Assembly which the Lord has provided for April 17 and 18. Yes, a &quot;Call to Action” Assembly in some three hundred cities ! A letter giving the names and addresses of the places chosen is enclosed herewith for all companies and pioneers. Place it where all the brethren may consult it. Every fighter for the New World will, by God’s grace, be present at one of these assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why has the Lord provided this assembly? So that all may join in the “Call to Action” campaign and thus have a share in the proclamation of the Kingdom as the people’s only hope, and also that they may associate with others in that proclamation. Further, what we shall hear there will increase our understanding and appreciation of our commission as well as stimulate us to greater, more efficient and more harmonious activity in behalf of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, to realize all this from the “Call to Action” Assembly, we must be in fighting trim, by having heeded the call to action from the very first day of April. “To him that hath shall be given&quot; applies here also. If we have the joy of the Lord and the zeal peculiar to His bouse, we shall receive still more, so that we shall have abundance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Sure to Go</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Immediately consult the list of the Assembly places, plan to attend the one nearest to you, write the Assembly servant telling him you will be present, and be prepared to be there on the morning of Saturday. the 17th. Start the day right by assembling for the call to action in the field. As there will be little routine work, practically everyone will be able to spend the forenoon in the house-to-house work, continuing with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign and particularly the distribution of the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front.</span><span class="font3"> In the afternoon, beginning at three o'clock, there will be street witnessing with the new booklet as well as with the magazines. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the evening the</span><span class="font3"> Lord's people will assemble to tell their field experiences, and to hear the stirring discourse “The Call to Action” and the instructive talk on “Improving Your Theocratic Ministry'’, which will be followed by a &quot;Demonstration”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Sunday morning there will be a baptismal service. All others will go immediately into the field, while those being immersed will do likewise after the immersion. In the afternoon, at three o'clock, the Assembly will again begin with the relating of field experiences, and at 3:1.5 the discourse &quot;Righteous Requirements” will be given. There will be a brief intermission and then all will hear the recorded lecture &quot;Fighters for the New World”, which Brother Knorr originally gave at Cleveland, Ohio. Sunday evening all will again gather at the assembly point for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, and then will return to their home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column</span><span class="font3"> 2)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Watchtower Bible to Be Released to the Public in May Do Not Miss the Interested</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is pleased to announce the release of the Watchtower edition of the Bible to the public in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This release should cause the hearts of all servants of the New World who attended the 1942 Assembly to greatly rejoice. Everyone at the “New World” Assembly was thrilled as the president of the Society told about the further work to be done, and to whom this work had been assigned. A thrill of joy and surprise swept over all in attendance as he spoke of the latest provision, the Watchtower Bible, and the aid it would be to fulfill the “Go Ahead” signal until the ‘houses are laid desolate’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As yet the houses are far from being ‘laid desolate’. The publishers still have the privilege of offering to many people of good-will the Bible which has so helped them in the past six months. Having used this to great advantage, the publishers should be able to point out to those of good-will how they will benefit and be able to ‘put on the whole armor of God, that they may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil’. The offer is the &quot;Watchtower Bible and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of $1.00. In cases where they have the latest book, another may be substituted, striving always to place with them the latest book that they do not have. The book is offered as a premium. The offer does not mean that if they have the books, or if they do not wish the book, they may have the Bible for 75c. and under no circumstance should this be done. The contribution for the Bible remains at $1.00. Bear in mind that this Bible has been provided to advance the interests of The Theocracy, and to aid the people of goodwill to gain a knowledge of God's purposes revealed therein. These may be ordered by companies now, at the company rate of We, and may be charged to the company stock account as campaign literature if the company account is balanced. Remember, when ordering, that they are packed 30 to a carton, weighing 46 pounds. Prepare now. Order only what you need. The Society is not overstocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Slack Not the Hand</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>This Is a Call to Action</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">By May the Lord’s people will have received many rich blessings at the hand of Jehovah. The month of April will undoubtedly have proved to be one of the most active the righteous have experienced. The concluding month of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">Campaign, with the release of the new booklet, and the “Call to Action” Assembly, climaxed by the Memorial supper held by each company, is but the manifestation of the power of Jehovah and, it is expected, will result in a tremendous increase throughout the entire earthly organization under Zion. The number of publishers, the time in the field, the back-calls, and all activity should hit a new peak; not an inflated one due to a momentary expression of enthusiasm, but rather that of genuine appreciation of the goodness of Almighty God, and a realization that it is his will that his work increase and that all publishers continue in this increase with patience and steadfastness until the rumblings of the battle of Armageddon are heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true fighters for the New</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World will not let up on the work, but will keep up the standard established during the month of April. Their job is that their ‘feet be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace’, putting forth diligent effort in their respective territories. The implement of work is “the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. Now to the field. Every subscriber for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> should be called on. Everyone on the hackcall list should be called on. Present to them now the opportunity of getting the Bible. Do not predetermine the results by past reactions to the witness. The territory in May will be all new. Why should the people be of a more receptive attitude in May than before? Because the appealing truths published in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font3"> which will have been distributed during April, are so enlightening that all persons who have a desire for that which is right will clearly see the issue facing them in these perilous times, and will be stimulated to investigate further, responding to the &quot;call to action”. This is not merely the idea of a man, but the great enlightening witness to open their minds is of ‘the Lord's doing and is marvelous in our eyes’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The field is set for work! The contact has been made. The people of good-will are able to see who is publishing liberty to the inhabitants of this land, and desire to know more about the Truth. The booklet has sown the seed; and now they must be nourished with the Truth, that they may grow. Jehovah's witnesses have the word of Truth, &quot;the sword of the spirit.” Not only do they have it, but they are equipped to use it. Put into action this instrument provided by the Lord. witli all its features. It was prepared for hand-to-hand fighting in the front lines in tills fight against the lowers of darkness, and, by God's grace, will be used for such. The publishers should be familiar with it and be ready to quickly draw this sword from its sheath and wield it expertly, because they have been instructed in this by the Lord. This Bible being left in the homes of the people, with proper instruction in its use, will drive home the message of truth deep into the &quot;innards” of religion, demonism, and totalitarian oppression; dealing a blow so devastating that they shall never recover, hut at the same time so enlightening that the flood of truth and light that shines as a result will reflect on the welcoming, receptive minds and hearts of the jieople of good-will, that they may bring themselves into subjection to the “Prince of Peace&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column /,) </span><span class="font3">territory for a full day's work in the field on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having feasted on the Lord's goodness for three days and been active in 1 lis service, we should be prepared in mind and heart for the Memorial supper. Those of the remnant appreciate the seriousness of the occasion, and realize that unless they are partaking of the reality in faithful daily service they are eating and drinking condemnation to themselves. The “other sheep” will also attend, and. while not partaking, will be helped as they realize that the Lord requires the same degree of devotion and faithfulness of them that he requires of the remnant. All will come from that meeting more determined than ever that nothing shall deter them from singing the praises of Jehovah and His King Christ Jesus. They will be &quot;more than conquerors through him that loved us”.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Standing Shoulder to Shoulder</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Considering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Day by day The Theocracy is on the increase. The activity, in publishers, hours, back-calls, and book studies, as well as other features of the service and the progress for the past year, has been published in the 1943 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font3"> As tribulations, perils and wickedness increase in the earth, peace, life and activity increase in The Theocracy. Today the Lord's people are at greater unity than they ever were before, and we may expect this to increase as we near that perfect day in the Kingdom. All those who have been given the greatest privilege ever granted any creature (that of being a Theocratic publisher) do not have time to waste on the petty affairs of this doomed old world. They delight to push aheail with zeal and enthusiasm in their battle against entrenched religion and demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This privilege is extended to all those who are dissatisfied with the present evil world and seek something better, whether they be of the anointed remnant or of the &quot;Jeph-thali's daughter” class. While the &quot;little Hock&quot; is on the decrease, the number of the “other sheep” is on the increase. Both the remnant and the Jonadabs have exactly the same commission anil assignment from tlie Lord and work side by side and shoulder to shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore it is suggested that in at least one service meeting during the month of April every company consider the portion from the 1943 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses, </span><span class="font3">page 41, “Standing Shoulder to Shoulder.&quot; One of the main points to lie stressed in tins article is the harmony of the Lord's organization.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Memorial</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Make All Preparations in Advance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good-will will assemble on April 19,1943, after 6 pan., Standard Time, to celebrate the memorial of our Lord's death. This will be an occasion of real joy for all, for it will lie the grand climax of the “Call to Action&quot; Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company servant should see that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> preparations for the Memorial are made well in advance so that upon returning from the Assembly point no time will need lie spent in preparatory work, but all publishers, including servants, will spend the full day of Monday in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The back-call servant should check the back-call file immediately and should see that all interested persons in the territory are called on and invited to attend the nearest &quot;Call to Action” assembly and also to attend the Memorial at the local company headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An accurate count of the attendance at the Memorial should be made, and also a count of those partaking of the emblems. This should be reported on the “Company Monthly Report Card”, tit the lower lefthand corner. 1’lease report the number in attendance and the number partaking. In no case should this be mailed later than the third of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All publishers should thoroughly study the March 1, 1943, issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> (both the article &quot;In Remembrance of the King&quot; and the article “Attenders at the Lord's Supper&quot;) and the March 15 issue, before the Memorial, and thus attend with the full understanding and knowledge of the significance of the event and be moved to action thenceforth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> general way show how this might be improved in your local company; show how close co-operation between all of the publishers Is very essential, that tlie responsibility and privilege of witnessing to the Kingdom is placed upon the “great multitude” as well as on the remnant, that all of the Lord's servants should now work together shoulder to shoulder in unison and harmony. The great necessity of every publisher's joyfully sharing his burden and participating in every phase of the witness work should be discussed, and that if each one does his part of the work as it should be done there will lie no time or energy left for getting entangled in the affairs of this world or letting outside interests take our attention away from our most important occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some capable brother in your company should be given this assignment and should arrange a very interesting and informative discussion on this article with the idea in mind of aiding the brethren to gain a keener appreciation of their Kingdom responsibilities and privileges of service. Many good suggestions on how to arrange discourses and talks of this nature can be found in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> articles &quot;I'resenting 'This Gospel of the Kingdom’ &quot;, and we believe that all the brethren will find these very helpful in arranging and preparing discussions for service meetings.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscription Campaign</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren everywhere are taking hold of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign with enthusiasm. The large amount of mail containing subscriptions coming to tlie office clearly indicates that the Lord is Messing their efforts to the glory of Ids name. Up to the first of March there have been approximately 20.000 subscription slips put through, and a number of others going through that have not been completely filed yet. All of this mail coming to hand at once requires considerable handling; consequently some of the subscriptions may not get into the hands of the people as soon as some of the brethren anticipate. All should receive their first issue of the magazine within one month. Wait that long before writing us about it. Keep up the good work.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>February Field Activity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The month of February shows a definite trend upward in the number of publishers participating in the field service. We have had an increase of more than 5,200 company publishers over the month of January, and an increase of more than 1,500 over the month of February last year, and a new all-time peak of 6.245 pioneers. This leads us to confidently anticipate a new all-time peak of all publishers, hours, and back-calls, for the month of April. The brethren everywhere are becoming accustomed to overcoming the obstacles that naturally exist as a result of the trying time in which we are living. This is what will make the Lord's people “more than conquerors” through Christ.</span></p>

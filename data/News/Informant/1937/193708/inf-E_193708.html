</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Equipped?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Offer 6 on $1.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a very definite relationship between our year's text and this special period. It was at Mount Perazim that David rose up against the racketeering adversaries of God in his day. At that time the Lord gave David the assurance that He would deliver the Philistines into his hands, and lie did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this time the anointed and their companions are going forward not in tlieir own strength, but in the strength of the Lord. The Lord lias instructed us and provided our equipment and shown us how to fight. We have the bound books, six on $1.00 contribution, and all the way up to 15 on a $2.50 contribution. By the time the “Mount Perazim” campaign goes on we shall have over 10,000 of the new phonographs in operation, in addition to the large number of sound ear equipment. We have the records “Riches’’ and “Value of Knowledge’’ to introduce the Kingdom message and emphasize its importance. We have “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” for our follow-up work. This equipment is provided by the Lord for our use now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That enumerated above is the main equipment to be used by everyone during this period, but, like every good army, we should also be prepared for emergencies where only small arms can be used effectively. Therefore, we should be prepared to drop down to three books</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every automobile will want to have on it a large sign,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">HEAR JUDGE RUTHKIU’OBD’S LECTURE S A F E T Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">12 Noon, September 19 Columbus Eair Grounds</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is arranging to make a large number of these signs in two colors. They can be had in two sizes: (&gt; inches by (1(5 inches, at 25c each; 17 inches by GG inches, at 50c each. The smaller signs can be put on the bumpers of your ears, and the large ones can be fitted in a frame to be carried on the top of your car. Remittances must be sent in with orders, stating definitely the number of large-size and of smallsize signs you require. If orders are sent in through the company servants we can mail them in larger quantities to the companies, thus saving considerably in postage. However, we shall be glad to send them to individuals anywhere at the above-named prices. Please get them before you come to the convention, so that you can advertise all along the way. It will have a very stimulating effect, particularly in Columbus and vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">on a 50c contribution, one on a 25c contribution, seven booklets on a 25c contribution, or three booklets on a 10c contribution. We are to show no quarter, but use everything we have and take advantage of every possible means to preach the Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Perazim</span><span class="font2"> means “a breach” or &quot;breaking forth”. It means the place of the Lord’s breaking forth against Devil worshipers, the soothsayers, the Philistines, ancient and modern. Let the anointed and their companions everywhere, strengthened by the power of Jehovah, send forth the Lord's truth of the Kingdom by means of books, booklets, phonographs, sound cars, transcription machines, sound boats, electric signs, and everything else, until it breaks forth like a rushing torrent to destroy every adversary in its path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What is our time going to be during this period? 1’loneers, 40 hours ; auxiliaries, 20; company publishers, 10 at least; and as much more as we are able to put in. Reread carefully your July </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">for details of the combinations, the territory to be worked, the proper method of reporting, etc. The company servants and service committees everywhere should give a lot of care and thought to the planning of this campaign. Y’our service meetings should be enthusiastic, and all preparations carefully arranged, as set out in the special outline for the month. Let’s enter this fight with joy and renewed effort!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Send Your Subscription for Convention Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Be In by September 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As announced in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">the Society has made arrangements with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal,</span><span class="font2"> a local daily newspaper of Columbus, to publish a full page in that newspaper each day of the convention activities. This page will contain reports of the various high lights of the convention, and interesting pictures. Whether you attend the convention or not, you will surely want to read these reports. The five issues of this newspaper that will contain these reports of the convention will be mailed to any address for 35c. Even if you go to the convention. you will want to have these papers sent to your home address so that you can review the activities when you get back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Send your subscriptions to the Watch Tower, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y.. and not to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal.</span><span class="font2"> These subscriptions should be sent in as soon as possible, and by September 1 at the very latest, as there is much work to do in preparing the wrappers. It will be a</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">convenience to the Society if Indi- state and country of each subscriber viduals who are associated with a | are necessary. Please write plainly.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Will Be the Best . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. . . Are You Going?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> covered the details of the convention, which all of you have read. There are just a few points the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> wishes to bring to your attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rooming Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will greatly facilitate matters for the rooming committee at the convention If you make arrangements for your rooms prior to the convention, giving them the information asked for in the July 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and having them make your assignment in writing. The more of these that are made before the time of the convention, the less rushed this department will be at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The railroads and most of the bus lines have a special round-trip rate to Columbus for group parties when 25 or more persons travel together from and return to any one city. Going by coach, the round-trip fare is 1J times the regular one-way first-class fare. The group does not have to return together or on the same train. This is also true of busses. Make inquiry locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There will be no need to bring any extra literature to the convention, as you will be able to get it there for the service work. You can bring with you a few books and booklets that you will use while traveling toward the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If for some reason pioneers are unable to make the complete trip to Columbus they may work in company territory en route. Make your arrangements with the company, and not with the Society. I &gt;o not work company territory until you have first received permission from the company servant. If you need the names and addresses, write the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers coming to the convention may find it convenient to come part way shortly, to within 5(10 miles of Columbus, and work some of the territories that are open. These are listed below. The following counties are located within 500 miles of Columbus and have not been covered with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> book and should prove excellent for the six-bound-book combination. Ask for assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Michigan : Iron, Baraga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Indiana: Part Adams, part Wells, part Miami, Whitley, part Kos-eiusco, part Starke, and Fulton. Illinois: Part Kendall, Douglas, Effingham, and Calhoun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">company will send all their subscriptions in at one time, with money order to cover. Name, street, city,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wisconsin : Part Brown, Adams, part Manitowoc, Trempealeau, Buffalo, Richmond, Iron, part Pierce, and part St. Croix.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alabama : Morgan, Jackson, Cherokee, Clay, and Tallapoosa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Georgia : Haralson. Chattooga, Dade, Gilmer, Pickens, Forsythe, Hall, Lumpkin, Union, Fannin, and White.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">West Virginia: Jefferson, Ilardy, Pendleton, Grant, Preston, Wirt, and Lincoln.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No provision is made to assign pioneer territory at the convention. All requests for territory should be in the Brooklyn office before September 1, so that you will receive your assignment before the convention. More than 700 counties in the country have not been worked within ihe last twelve months. These are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All roads lead to Columbus, and we hope that by the Lord's grace you will be on one of these roads. This convention will be the best !</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Announcements for “Safety”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Radio announcements advertising Brother Rutherford’s lecture “Safety” from the Columbus convention will be supplied to all companies well in advance, so that they may be properly and judiciously distributed before the brethren leave for the convention. While<sup>1</sup> we are anxious to have all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> these announcements distributed, it should, however, be kept in mind that if they are distributed too far in advance miirli of their effectiveness is lost. Therefore plan this distribution carefully. Plan it so that all the folders are placed in the hands of the people, but keep it as close to the convention as practical without unduly interfering with the witness work and your coming to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the west coast, where many of the brethren are leaving early for the convention, it may be necessary for the publishers to work well into the evening in this distribution work, as well as distributing the announcements during the day in their regular house-to-house witnessing. Undoubtedly the Lord has a message of vital importance for the people at that time. Therefore, see that it is advertised properly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Advertisements for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Electric Flasher Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has just designed and printed four new advertisements for the electric flasher signs. These are printed in three colors and are very attractive. All that you need to do to put one of these advertisements in your sign is to paste it on the outside of the glass. They can be changed weekly. These signs will be sent anywhere at the following rates:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 set of 4 advertisements 10c;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3 sets of 4 advertisements 25c; 10 sets of 4 advertisements 60c; More than 10 sets to one address, 6c per set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These new advertisements can be used not only in the electric signs, but in many other places, as they make good daytime signs. Pioneers can use them on their trailers, and they can be put up in many places where it is not possible to have an electric sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are You Using an Electric Sign?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society still has some on hand, and so that they may all get into use they will be supplied at $1.00 each with the four new advertisements. Order yours now and advertise. The Society will appreciate it if the company servants will take up this at the earliest service meeting and find out how many electric signs can be used in the company, and order these all at one time. Remember, a set of the new advertisements comes free with the electric sign, at $1.00 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Sound Equipment</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Place Orders Now</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Compact, Light, and Will Do the Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society takes pleasure in announcing a new piece of sound equipment known as Sound Equipment No. 4 (SE #4). This new equipment is a 10-watt outfit having the following features:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Turntable, pickup, microphone and amplifier are in one all-metal case 16i inches by 17 inches by 8J inches (Including the lid), weighing only 60 pounds. The amplifier is an improved type class “A” using two 6L6 tubes and one 6C8 tube. It is entirely battery-operated from a flvolt storage battery of special low gravity type which will supply current for five hours of operation. Thus the equipment can be operated independently of the ear and its battery. A charger also is furnished, for charging the battery from 110-volt AC house current. The horn furnished with SE #4 is similar to that used on the No. 3 equipment, but smaller and considerably lighter in weight. It can be supported on the roof of a car by eight rubber suction cups which are cemented to the top, thus eliminating the drilling of any holes in the car top. It can easily be lifted off the car by two persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This equipment can be had for $140. There have been many requests for a smaller and cheaper equipment. Quality has not been sacrificed in producing this equipment. It has 10-waft output and is amply strong for villages and for work in city streets. The Society will have a few of these on hand at the Columbus convention for your inspection. In the meantime you can place your orders. We hope to be able to make some shipments about October 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is still prepared to rebuild your present PTM equipment which operates from a 6-volt battery into a sound car equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Series in the Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This important work should also be pushed vigorously during the next few months. The Lord God is now exposing the various elements comprising the Devil’s organization. This is done for the benefit of the people of good will particularly. The people in every territory are entitled to this provision made by the Lord, and every company holding a territory or assignment is responsible before the Lord to see that arrangements are made so that the people will have an opportunity to get this information. Not to do so is to withhold from the stranger his right. It is a great privilege to be used of the Lord for this purpose. During the summer months many of the brethren will want to use their Saturday afternoons and evenings advertising and putting on these lectures in small rural communities as well as witnessing from house to house Saturday afternoon and Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The &quot;Exposed” work on Sunday should be planned and directed where it will accomplish the most effective witness, using the sound cars at strategic points in the territory, and phonographs in the regular house-to-house witnessing and back-call work, and transcription machines can also be used effectively by placing the loud-speaker on top of the car and putting on the lectures over that. Keep all sound equipment busy &quot;Exposing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transferring Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The July </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> states the Society would arrange for companies to supply pioneers with literature whenever it is so possible. A good number have taken this to mean that they themselves could supply pioneers with literature without first obtaining permission from the Society to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is not the case. You are not to turn over any books or booklets to pioneers, auxiliaries, or another company, nor receive literature from any of these, except on instructions from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers or auxiliaries desiring to take literature from any company will please send their orders to the Society as usual, suggesting that they could take their stock from ------ company. The Society will then instruct all concerned if the arrangements are satisfactory. If not, other arrangements will be made to fill the orders. The transfers that have already been made improperly will be put through the accounts, but please do not do this again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendations for Company Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A letter has been sent to all companies, requesting them to recommend three names of brethren whom they consider qualified to serve as company servant during the coming year, and to forward this information to the Society by the latter part of July. Please see that this matter is taken care of and the information forwarded promptly, as much of the work pertaining to the appointments will have to be taken care of prior to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No. 3. The Society will furnish a new power pack, horn and other necessary equipment, and will completely overhaul your present transcription machine at an additional cost of $80; with microphone, $90. For details, write the Society.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COLUMBUS CONVENTION SEPTEMBER 15-20 WILL BE THE BEST! ARE YOU GOING?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice to Operators of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brethren who have cars with sound equipment No. 2 mounted thereon, and who intend coming to the Columbus convention, should note the following: When taking long trips the generator should be set back so as to charge only about 4 amperes. If driving by night is contemplated, then have generator set so that the meter registers zero when driving lights are on. This will save not only the generator, but the battery as well. Driving with lights on in the daytime will save the battery but not the generator. If the brethren will give attention to this, then they will not arrive at Columbus with their generator burned out, and their equipment will be in good condition to use.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Don’t Write; Read This</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Frequent requests and inquiries on matters heretofore stated impel a restatement of elementary facts concerning enemy tactics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">New Ordinances</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every week or so someone writes in telling of a new peddling or soliciting ordinance and asks, “What shall we do?” Answer: Keep right on preaching the Gospel. If you stop for every new law you meet you will not do much witnessing. Don’t let an ordinance scare you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Arrests</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Follow instructions of the Order of Trial, and when you report give us all the information asked for, to wit: 1. Copy of complaint. 2. Copy of ordinance. 3. Statement of facts concerning arrest. Keep on studying the Order of Trial. It’s marvelous how much of it can be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sound Car Permits</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Shall we get permits for soundcar operation?” Certainly. That has been answered several times. “If they will not give us a permit, shall we go ahead anyway?” No. If a community wants to shut off soundcar noises it has the right to so do. We must obey. “They won't give us a permit for Sunday. What shall we do?” Take your sound equipment somewhere else on Sunday. The point is this: Caesar has the right to regulate or prohibit noises. Give Caesar what belongs to him by complying with such ordinances, as long as they are enforced without discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company Towns</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some communities whole towns are owned by industrial corporations whose employees live in company-owned houses. Frequently the corporation will issue orders that the publishers may not go from house to house in its domains, on the theory that it owns the property and can dictate who may enter. The employee in such case is usually a tenant, the use of the premises being part of the pay for working for the corporation. The law is that where a tenant lives in property completely surrounded by land of his landlord the landlord must supply him and his callers with a right of way to and from his property. Such principle of law would seem to apply in the cases of these company towns, and therefore the corporation has no legal right to forbid your entrance to the houses of the employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Save the above valuable information and do not waste time by asking again the same questions here answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Report for “Faithful Warrior” Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The report of the “Faithful Warrior” international testimony period, March 27-April 4, 1937, is very gratifying. Set out below are the totals of the reports received from 84 different countries throughout the world. It is interesting to note the increased attendance at the </span><span class="font3">Me</span><span class="font2">morial. It was hoped that more of these would be able to get into the field work. In your consideration of this report, we feel sure that </span><span class="font3">every </span><span class="font2">effort will be made on the part of all the brethren to get into the field during the next international period. In 1936 there were 46,209 publishers in the field. We sincerely hope that in October we can reach that 50,000 mark. The brethren working in the field are pushing the battle to the gate. Are you one of them? It is a joy to all of us in the work to push on in unity the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The bound-book campaign of six on $1.00 contribution is to be continued. Cover your entire rural territory particularly with this combination. We do not get out to the country and call upon the people there as often as we do in the city; therefore this provision should be extended to the country people particularly. Use your phonograph to introduce the literature. Of course, if you do not have a phonograph, use the testimony card. Try to put on as many “Exposed” series among the farmers and country people as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In view of the fact that a great many of the publishers throughout the country are contemplating attending the Columbus convention, making it necessary for them to travel a considerable distance and leave home early, this will mean that for two weeks, at least, their local territory will not receive the attention it ordinarily would. An effort should be made between now and the convention to make up for this by covering as much additional territory as you possibly can. Remember to move your storage stock!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companies having a large stock of literature were recently written for inventories of their stock, so that they could be used as shipping points to fill pioneer and auxiliary orders during the bound-book campaign. If there are other companies having a large stock of bound books who wish to come under this arrangement, let the company servant arrange immediately to send to the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, an inventory of the company’s stock. We will do what we can to reduce </span><span class="font3">such stock.</span></p>

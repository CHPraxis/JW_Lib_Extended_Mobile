<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">February 6-14 Should Be Joyful Occasion</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah constantly blesses his people with truths as he brings them forth from the temple. Again he has provided the remnant with a very important message to be placed in the hands of the people. This message is contained in a new booklet, on the cover of which appear these words: “PROTECTION from those who seek to hurt or destroy me. How can I find n?” This is illustrated in two colors and will arouse much Interest. This booklet shows that the conclusion generally held amongst the people, that religion and Christianity are one and the same, is very erroneous. It will be a mighty weapon in the hands of the Lord’s organization on earth to clear away the refuge of lies set up by religious organizations. Each one of you will profit greatly by carefully studying the booklet and then distributing it widely.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Is Your Personal Progressing?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have One?</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Repeatedly the phonograph service has been brought to the attention of the brethren. Much work is being done with this equipment, but because it appears that its importance may not be fully realized by many, it should receive further attention, and more careful consideration and application by all. Those who have gone ahead with the phonograph work and become more proficient in its use can be of great aid to their fellow witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purpose is to make the Kingdom message clear to the people, to aid them to understand it. to give a better witness, to aid the people with everything at our command to be educated in the Word of Jehovah. That is our job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We should use the phonograph at every opportunity, presenting the literature in conjunction therewith, to help the people understand what the Bible teaches, to aid the people of good will in taking their stand on the Lord’s side, to make available to them the provision which Jehovah has spread on his table, or altar. We must not say that all or any of this provision of Jehovah is to be despised, or that ‘the altar of the Lord is contemptible’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Since </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the Society began to manu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A short, to-the-point testimony card has been prepared, which will assist in its distribution. February 6-14 is a special testimony period that is known as “Jehovah of Hosts”. It is during this period that an extraordinary effort will be made to distribute this booklet world-wide. Shipments are now being made to the distant English-speaking lands, so they will be on hand for that period. Each company, pioneer, auxiliary. in fact, all publishers, should now have in mind this period and make preparation for the same. Select territory that can be worked in the inclement weather. If there are apartments in your territory, they should be set aside for this period, as we expect it will be a cold month in the Northern Hemisphere. Using three booklets, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font0"> and two colored-cover book-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Phonograph Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">facture portable phonographs, In 1934, over 5,000 of these have been made and supplied to the publishers. The orders are heavy now, and all companies or isolated individuals desiring these machines should order as soon as they can, so as to have their orders filled in turn as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The publishers are finding it greatly to their advantage to have their own personal phonograph for the service, so that they will always have one with them, and not have to miss opportunities for using it because of having to share it with someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And then, having procured the equipment, how about using it effectively? The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font0"> has carried a great many good, practical suggestions, recommendations and methods of procedure for the use of these machines, and all this information should be carefully considered. and action taken in accordance therewith by all the publishers. Your service meeting is the place for these studies and arrangements to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That the use of the phonograph, especially in the door-to-door work, is at first strange and awkward is to be expected. It is application that brings naturalness. You will probably use the machine in the homes several times during a day’s work, and this will rest you, give you a chance to get warm, and, in fact, if you use the machine as opportunity affords, you will not get as tired in the service as going from door to door steadily without using </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a machine. </span><span class="font0">lets, will make it a little easier for the brethren to do the witness work, along with the phonograph, which is a real assistance in bringing the message to the people and making it clear to them. Any colored-cover booklets may be used, but we suggest that one of them be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font0"> if your territory has not been thoroughly covered with it. All company servants, pioneers and auxiliaries should order their supply now. This period should be a joyful occasion to the remnant and to the Jonadabs. They know that they have the protection of the Lord, and it is a real joy for us to show those of good will how they too may obtain protection. It is our privilege and responsibility to make preparation now for “Jehovah of Hosts” testimony period, February 6-14.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Important</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">You will have received the special letter covering tlie campaign with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font0"> which is to be presented to the signers of the petition. You will receive further advice regarding the details of this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the meantime get all your names in territory order, so that they can be turned over to the publishers with the assignment of territory. Names from outside your company territory should be forwarded to the company in whose territory the names belong. If you have the name and address of the company servant or any others in that company, please send these names to them for use in their territory. Names that you are unable to dispose of yourself may be forwarded to the Society, and we will see that they are sent to the proper party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The phonograph may be presented following the presentation of the literature, or, If seen advisable by the publisher.may be presented first, then the literature be offered in the home. That there are obstacles to be overcome in both methods is evident, and you will learn of these best by’ actually encountering them and finding how they can be overcome. We want those brethren who are using the phonographs to write us. giving all information that might be of aid to other brethren. Advise us of the problems you have solved, and how, and especially effective methods of presenting the phonograph and getting it into use. It appears that homes of the middle class and “better” class are hardly’ as easily accessible as are those of the poorer people, and many of you will have helpful suggestions along this line that we should like to hear about.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Of course, every one of Jehovah’S witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs. will want to get a copy of the 1937 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font0"> and read the annual report by the president of the Society. It is a source of great joy to such to read how the Kingdom work has progressed in various countries amidst much persecution and opposition. Each one of them will desire to consider the year text and the brief discussion by the president; additionally they will derive much encouragement and enlightenment from the daily’ texts and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, in addition to those who have actively taken their stand on Jehovah’s side, there are undoubtedly many other people of good will who have just recently come in contact with the truth and would like to read the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font0"> Such people naturally’ have many’ questions In their minds in regard to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. They want to know who we are, if we are not just another religious sect, why we won’t salute the flag, and concerning many other questions. The 1937 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font0"> answers these questions in a pointed way, and the report of the work done in each country<sup>1</sup> will prove to them that it is the power of Jehovah directing this work. Be sure to K'll those people about the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font0"> and offer to order it for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those associated with a company should place their order through the company servant; others may send their<sup>-</sup> orders direct to the Society. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font0"> will be mailed to anyone on a contribution of 50c a copy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>1937 Calendar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">The text chosen for 1937 is from Obadiah 1: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” The picture on the Calendar for 1937 vividly’ portrays the opposing armies in this battle, and you will study it with much interest. It will constantly remind you of the issue, “Who is Supreme?” and stimulate a desire to have a greater part In the battle on Jehovah’s side during the coming year. The Calendar also contains a timely letter to Jehovah’s witnesses and companions from the president of the Society. This letter sets out the testimony periods for the year, and all the brethren should plan their activities during the year so as to put in a greater effort during these periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Calendar may he had, five copies on a contribution of $1.00, sent to one address, or, singly, on a 25c contribution. Those associated with a company should place their orders through the company servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Outline for the Conduct</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>of Service Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Company Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font0"> the company servant will receive a suggested outline for conducting service meetings. The Society’s correspondence and the regional servants’ reports indicate that the weak point in almost all the companies is the service meeting. If properly conducted, the service meeting can become one of the most interesting and profitable meetings the company holds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The object of the suggested outline is to aid the company servant and service committee in planning the work and in making these meetings interesting and profitable. The outline should be carefully followed out, and plans made beforehand to take care of the various features of the work. The Society will put forth every effort to see that you have the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font0"> at the beginning of booklets are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protection, Loyalty, Government, Who Shall Rule the World!</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Truth.</span><span class="font0"> Check your stock of booklets, order all you need, and clear your shelves of any surplus you may have of certain ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Seven booklets for seven weeks. Carry booklets, present booklets, talk booklets, place booklets, and have a full share in bringing our placements of literature to the fore. You will recall, from the previous announcement of this booklet campaign, that if each publisher in the country placed only 210 booklets the entire stock of all companies would be put in the hands of the people. How far along are you with your 210? It will be profitable for you to carefully consider the details of this booklet campaign in your service meetings, and complete all arrangements for effective winter work. As announced elsewhere, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font0"> may be used as one of the seven booklets in this campaign as soon as you order and receive your supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since you may place fourteen booklets on a contribution of fifty cents, carry a good assortment, and, of course, drop to a combination of three on a ten-cent contribution if more cannot be taken, or even one booklet where several cannot be had. Jehovah has made this provision of booklets for the use of his witnesses. Let us make the most of it to the advancement of the Kingdom message and the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Include </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in Your Report of Literature Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Copies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> placed with the people are not to be reported as booklets placed, nor otherwise reported. An exception was the copies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font0"> used during the Newark convention, or some other such exception concerning which the publishers involved were notified, but this is all past now, and in no instance is the number of copies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font0"> placed to be reported, either as booklets or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Outline for Service Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two copies of ‘How to Conduct a Service Meeting’, also, are sent with this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font0"> and careful consideration should be given to this outline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">each month, so that the month’s work may be planned and executed in an orderly manner. The company servant should discuss the different points for each meeting, as contained in this outline, with the service committee and with the company. The points to be taken up at the following week’s service meeting should be announced at the close of the previous service meeting, and copies given to all study chairmen to briefly discuss at their studies, so that all the brethren will have an opportunity to think upon them and make suggestions and generally have part in the work. The Kingdom service is not the responsibility of the company servant alone, nor of the company servant and service committee; it is the responsibility of the entire group, and everyone should be vitally concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We should be glad to hear from you regarding the use of such an outline—whether you think it is advantageous or otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The report for November was very gratifying. This month finds an increase in number of publishers over the same month of 1935, as well as a good increase in the number of hours in the field. There were nearly 3,000 more publishers. Another good point in the report is the splendid increase in the distribution of bound books: sixty thousand more of these being distributed during this November than in that of the previous year. Last month’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font0"> pointed out that there was a terrible drop in October’s work. The question asked at that time was, What will November be? The answer is set out above; and it is better, in fact, very much better than a year ago. However, there is always room for improvement ; and, now that the first two months of the year have gone by, let us compare October and November of this year with the same two months of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Company publishers have averaged 11.4 hours a month during October and November, 1936, whereas last year the company publishers aver</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Following is an excerpt from a regional servant’s report received in this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I notice many of the witnesses are not very clean and neat in appearance. While this is a hard matter in many cases because they are very poor and find it hard to make a living, yet many of them are careless. Some have never been used to anything else and do not think it important. In small companies and small towns where everyone is known and only dirty and poorly dressed witnesses call upon the people, it makes a very poor impression, and often those of this class say sharp and unkind things, bringing additional reprcaeh on the work. While not everyone can be well dressed and use fine words, yet many could do better along this line.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This matter has been called to the attention of the brethren repeatedly in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font0"> Those who bear the vessels of the Lord and the fruits of the Kingdom should be clean outside as well as inside. They not only should separate themselves entirely from the Devil’s organization, but should also be clean, neat and presentable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Place Order by January 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One copy of the Order Blank is sent out with each batch of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font0"> Each company servant and stockkeeper should check to see what literature they need, hooks and booklets of all kinds, and add this to their order for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font0"> booklets. Order plenty, as you will need them. You may use </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font0"> in the 7-booklet campaign as soon as you receive your supply. We hope you can arrange for 100-pound shipments, as this effects a saving in freight. aged 12 hours a month. That’s a decrease. That's the reason why they were 52.872 field hours behind that of last year. Other publishers, auxiliaries and pioneers, have also helped to bring about a decrease in hours. The auxiliaries during the first two months of this year have reached 43.7 hours, and last year, same period, their average was 49.5 hours, almost making their quota of 50 hours, whereas this year they are considerably below. Now for the pioneers; did they help the decrease? Let’s see. Last year their average in hours was 112.5. That’s 21 hours better than the quota set by the Society for pioneers. This year pioneers averaged during October and November 85.7 hours in the field per month. No wonder we are having a decrease in hours I Each one of us, whether company publisher, auxiliary or pioneer, should consider carefully now how we are going to make up that time which was lost. With back calls, the use of the sound equipment being included with our door-to-door witnessing as “field hours&quot;, there really should be an increase, not a decrease. The November report is encouraging and is a splendid move in the right direction, witli more publishers and more hours than for the same month last year. Again, the question is asked, What will December be? Right now, comparing the work of the first two months of tills year with that of last year, we find an increase in number of books of 104,813 ; decrease in number of booklets, 1,516,929; increase in publishers, 963; decrease in hours, 52,872; decrease in obtainers, 583,925; decrease in sound attendance, 452,807. Shall we turn them all into an increase within a few months? We shall if we put in the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Change of Address</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All pioneers and auxiliaries are requested to take special notice of the following suggestions, which should be fully carried out, in order that prompt and accurate service can be given and result in a saving of time, work, and expense to all involved.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Always use the regular “Change of Address” slips when notifying this office of your new address. These slips are for the use of pioneers and auxiliaries; no one else is to use them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Be prompt in sending in notice of your change of address. Notify us at least one week in advance of change if located in the eastern states; if in the western states, two weeks advance notice should be given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Carefully fill out and check each slip to see that all the information asked for is given. Particular care should be taken to see that the name of the town or city to which you are moving is spelled correctly and written plainly; some brethren are unusually careless in filling out this important item.</span></p></li></ul>

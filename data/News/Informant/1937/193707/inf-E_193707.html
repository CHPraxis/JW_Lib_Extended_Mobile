<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>750,000 Bound Books Our Goal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">For a long while now the publishers have been stressing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of a quarter, or three booklets on a contribution of ten cents. More than three million of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> book have already been printed, and most of them distributed to the public. Many of these people have now read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> and would like to learn more about God's kingdom. Many others have received one, two, three or perhaps six or more booklets; but what about the other bound books concerning the Kingdom? It is important that these people continue their study of God's Word; and to aid these jieople to get books, an amazing offer is made for the months of July and August and the first twelve days in September, which applies to both English and foreign books. This offer is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Any six hound books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on a contribution of $1.00;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Any nine bound books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on a contribution of $1.50;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Any’ twelve bound books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on a contribution of $2.00;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The entire set or fifteen books on a $2.50 contribut ion; or Any’ six bound books and seven booklets on a contribution of $1.25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If anyone is unable to contribute a dollar, then drop to three bound books on a contribution of fifty cents or seven booklets on contribution of a quarter, but all the publishers should first offer six books. These six books may be any six of the fifteen bound books written by Brother Rutherford. For that reason we urge all publishers to carry along the entire set. so the people can make their selection, or at least have complete sets available in your car. Those who are unable to carry all fifteen of the books will find an excellent opportunity to use the illustration in the center of the testimony booklet or in the catalog which exhibits all the books and booklets in full color. Special testimony cards for six books are being sent along with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Heretofore we have had special campaigns of three books on contribution of fifty cents, but never an opportunity to place any six of Judge Rutherford’s books on such a contribution rate. Can we place books in such large combinations? There’s every reason why we should. Let’s try 1 One thing is sure; if we talk only one book to the people, we won’t place more than one book. If we talk three books, we won’t place more than three books. Let’s talk six books, then, from July 1 until September 12. In addition to the extraordinarily low rate, here are some other reasons why you should be able to place six or more books at one time during this special campaign :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1. The Phonograph</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Thousands of the brethren now have the new phonograph which they have become accustomed to using regularly in the witness work. We don’t have to tell you what a big aid this is In placing bound books. You’ve found that out for yourself. The phonograph cuts down the number of calls per hour, but these calls are more productive. Heretofore the biggest difficulty in placing more than one bound book at a time was that we couldn’t get enough time to exhibit them, especially in towns and cities. However, that difficulty is overcome when you get inside with the phonograph. After hearing one or more of the records with the message of God’s kingdom the people are in a better mood to examine the books. During this campaign let every publisher who has a phonograph play the record I’-102 Riches first and then make a display of at least six bound books, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font1"> Then run other rwords if desired, answering questions that may be asked and going into a detailed explanation of how to use the literature and its benefits. If the person manifests more than ordinary interest, show him the advantage of securing nine, twelve, or even fifteen bound books. Remember, the entire set of fifteen books on only $2.50 contribution, (luring this campaign; and that’s a small amount when one stops to think of the great value in these books. There isn't anything on earth that one could get with $2.50, or with any amount, in fact, that w’ould bring him the joy and satisfaction lie could get from a study of these books. Bring this point home to the people. If they can’t take all the books at one time, make a back call during these ten weeks, so they can take advantage of this special offer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Rural Work</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This is the time of the year when we can put in lots of time. Time Is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Right in the Midst of the Bound-Book Campaign</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">In his loving-kindness toward his people Jehovah blesses them with abundant provisions of spiritual food and privileges of service. A wealth of opportunities falls upon them from the ‘opened windows of heaven’, and this present time Is filled with gift upon gift from the Lord's loving hand. “Glittering Sword” testimony period has just passed, the marvelous arrangement for distributing the bound books becomes effective July 1, and right In the midst of that special and Important work Jehovah's witnesses and their Jonadab associates will be privileged to join wholeheartedly In the witness period of August 7-15, &quot;Mount Pebazim.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Jehovah used David at Mount Perazim of old, the time Is come when Jehovah through Christ will &quot;rise up”. Picturing the present warfare of witnessing against God’s enemies and to the honor of His name, the battle of Mount Perazim accomplished a testimony to the Lord of Hosts. Thus is shown the purpose of the present work of witnessing. The special witness periods set aside throughout the year are especially blessed by the Lord, and they are shared in to the extent that eacli individual has a personal part tlierein. Just preceding the Columbus convention by a month, the united efforts of all the brethren during “Mount Pebazim” witness period are a fitting forerunner of the united efforts of the brethren assembled at the convention Itself. Take full advantage of this provision of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Booklets on 25c Contribution</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Self-Covered and Four Colored-Cover</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Booklets should not be overlooked at any time in the witness work. They are important; their message is now due to be brought to the people; they stimulate the reading of bound books, and should be left with the people on all occasions possible, in combination, or singly when several cannot be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To aid tlie publishers In presenting combinations of booklets, stand</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscriptions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Many of the subscribers for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> are not familiar with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> and In contacting these, as well as other interested people, their attention should be directed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> and their subscription taken. In many com</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bound-book distribution will receive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> great boost because of thia witness period. It will greatly aid in moving your large storage stock. The special offer of six books on a contribution of one dollar will be the big feature during “Mount Perazim”, and a good portion of the distribution should be accomplished during those nine days. All the advantages that the summer season brings, and there are a great many, should be utilized to make this period the high point of the year in hours in the field and books left with the people. Warm weather, long hours of daylight, time off from secular work, all territory accessible— make the most of these. Plan your work, your territory and your stock of literature. Arrange for the two Saturdays and two Sundays to be four full five- or six-hour days In the field, and get in some beal time during this most favorable season. Arrange all-day witnessing parties every day possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the many features of the service have been worked out by the companies during the past testimony periods of the year, the local organizations should have been brought to smooth and efficient operation. Every part of the witness Mork, house-to-house with literature, phonographs, back calls, “Exposed,” and all details, should by now be in operation in all the companies ; and they are, in all companies that have gone ahead in accordance with the campaign as outlined during the past months. Apply all of these to “Mount Perazim” witness period. Let everyone “rise up”, taking his place and doing his part in the warfare now on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ard combinations as follows can be offered on the contributions designated :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On July 1, 1937. and thereafter, the standard combinations will be: Three self-covered booklets and four colored-cover booklets on a contribution of twenty-five cents. Also, three booklets may be placed on a contribution of ten cents, as heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This applies to all booklets, English and foreign languages as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">panies, some of those who regularly attend </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies do not have their own individual copy. The studies will be of even greater value to these if they receive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> personally, each issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Continue to bring </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font1">to the attention of all Interested persons, and particularly in making back calls.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Check Your Stock of Books</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Place Those of Which You Have the Most</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every company should take an inventory of its stock of books and then advise the publishers, so they can stress the books of which they have the most. Many of the companies have large stocks of books in storage. The bound-book campaign during July, August and the early part of September will furnish a good opportunity to dispose of this surplus stock. Place the literature you have on hand first, and then when you begin to run low, order more from tlie Society. Keep a supply of all the bound books on hand, but push particularly those of which you have the most</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where pioneers are working in the vicinity of companies we will arrange for them to take over part of the company stock. However, pioneers should send all their orders to the Society as usual, and we will furnish instructions to the company servant when to make a transfer. Pioneers who are working In company territory, or near a company, and could conveniently pick up their books from the company stock if so instructed, please so state on your orders, and we will arrange for a transfer to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonographs and More Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The enthusiasm and results with which the brethren have taken hold of the phonograph campaign are thrilling. We have made and shipped well over 10,000 phonographs. In fact, we are well on the way to the 11,000 and they are still going strong. The orders for this period were for between 13,000 and 14,000 machines; so we are still behind, but striving hard to catch up. Do not let the fact that we are behind on these orders deter you. Keep pushing the battle to the gate. Send in your orders, and we will get them to you as fast as possible. The phonograph is a very decided factor in the “strange work” the Lord is now doing in the earth. Every publisher who possibly can obtain and use one should have a phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Businessmen Read </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Protection</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These booklets are Important to all people in all territory, and are to be left at every opportunity, in residential, rural and business districts. What we now have in mind particularly is the necessity for these booklets’ being left with business people of all kinds. It is important that pioneers or others who are witnessing in business territory get the message of these publications into the hands of the business men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many commercial, professional and governmental people are awakening to the baneful power and influence of organized religion. Regardless of the number of them that may manifest good will toward God, all should have their attention directed to the testimony of God’s Word as set forth in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers in business districts, leave these booklets in all combinations of literature possible. Even if no bound books are taken and you place booklet combinations, include these two, also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon.</span><span class="font1"> When more literature is not desired, try to leave </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protection </span><span class="font1">at least. By including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon </span><span class="font1">you have a combination of three essential booklets on a contribution of ten cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rates to Publishers During Special Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the period when six bound books are offered on a dollar contribution, the rates to company publishers and auxiliaries will be 5c less than the usual rates. The pioneer rate will be the same as usual, as it is already very low. All Invoices for books will be made out at the regular rates, and credits will be placed on company and auxiliary accounts based on the bound books placed in combination and reported on your report cards. This 5c allowance per book will be credited on your account monthly, unless otherwise stated on your report card. It is therefore important that accurate reports be made each month if you would receive proper credit. Credits will be based on the number of books reported placed in combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore please show at the bottom of your report card for these three months, July, August and September, the number of bound books that have been placed in this special combination. July and August will, of course, cover the entire month. In September the combinations will apply only until September 12. Any books placed after that date are not to be placed in special combination, and are not to be reported as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Care of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Phonograph</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the brethren are writing to the Society saying that their phonographs rattle when running records. This is in the reproducer, riease keep in mind that these reproducers are delicate instruments and must be handled with a reasonable amount of care. They must be put in their proper place securely and should not be banged around. They can be damaged easily by a slight bump on the part that holds the needle. The diaphragm is easily damaged if handled roughly. We must take care of the instruments the Lord has given us, and it is suggested that everyone use the phonograph with care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reproducer heads can be replaced at the cost of 50c. We cannot repair damaged ones, because to repair them would cost as much as a new one. All phonographs are thoroughly tested before leaving the factory, and are packed well. You should receive them in good condition. The Society therefore cannot replace the reproducer free of charge unless complaint is made immediately on receipt of your phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1. column</span><span class="font1"> 2) always one of the essential factors in placing literature. It is also the time of year when the rurals are easy to get to. Many publishers find that they can spend 7 or 8 hours or more a day in the rurals to advantage. You can't call on the country people so often as the city-folk, but they -will give you more time and attention. Make these calls count. In many of these places you will find it convenient to display all fifteen of the bound books. When you work in rurals, be prepared to trade for chickens, eggs, and other produce. With daylight saving time in effect a few evenings can be spent on nearby rural roads.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you going to Columbus September 15-20? “Yes! My vacation’s arranged. I’ll be there!”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Immediate Attention, Please I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have learned that some of the records of the new series P-61-A to P-96-R were wrongly coupled together by the manufacturers. We have reports, for instance, that record P-75-0 was coupled with P-78-R instead of P-73-M as it should have been, and consequently the record P-73-M covering the subject “Images” was entirely omitted from the series. Others have reported that they found P-75-0 coupled with P-76-P. This also is wrong. The way these records should be coupled together, from P-69-1 to P-80-B, is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-69-1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-70-J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-73-M</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-71-K &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-72-L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-75-O</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-74-N &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-77-Q &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-78-R</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-76-P &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-79-A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P-SO-B</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All brethren who have the new series of records, please immediately check the above numbers to see that they are coupled together properly as indicated. Do not go merely by the labels on the records, because the label may be right and the lecture wrong. Look first at the number on the label, then at the number that is stamped on the surface of the record itself, right near the label. These two numbers should correspond. In order to further check these records, we give below the first few words of each record from P-71 to P-78:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-71 “It is wholly unreasonable to conclude ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-72 “There being a complete absence of proof ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-73 “In the Roman Catholic church organization images...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-74 “The Roman Catholic Church teaches that all priests ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-75 “Note now what the Bible says ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-76 “Chiefest amongst all liars is the Devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-77 “It was the religionists amongst the Jews ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">P-78 “Laying aside your prejudice, if you have any ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please listen to the opening sentence of each of the above records and see if the words correspond to the numbers given. If not, kindly let us know which records are wrongly coupled together, so that we can have replacements made. Also give us the name of the manufacturer, shown on the label. This should be done immediately, so that we can make final adjustment with the manufacturers. In case you find your records are correctly stamped, then it is not necessary to advise the Society. We want these reports only where the records are wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">culty in placing many combinations of six books. Businessmen will appreciate the unusual value in six books on a contribution of a dollar.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Other Territory</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to the rurals and business sections, publishers may work in residential sections, in small towns, large cities, or wherever it is most convenient, during this campaign. Try to cover all your territory thoroughly, but if unable to get over it all during July, August, and the first twelve days in September, then try to cover those sections which have been least worked so far this year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Back Calls</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Back calls furnish another splendid opportunity to place bound books. Everywhere you go you should take the names of interested parties and arrange to call back on them at a convenient time. Many of the companies already have a good list of names of interested persons. Try to call on these during</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Letter to Be Read to the Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On July 1 each company is being forwarded a letter from the Society requesting them to make arrangements for their company organization for the fiscal year 1938. It requests that the service committee be chosen and, from among those chosen, three names of the most active ones be forwarded to the Society for consideration for company servant. While the organization is to be chosen, it will not go into effect, of course, until October 1, the beginning of the Society’s fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This matter should receive attention and be acted upon as soon as reasonably possible. The letter is mailed to the company servant, who is instructed to turn it over to the secretary, who will be responsible to see that the entire letter is read lo the company. Where there is no secretary the company servant may do this himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Cancellation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of Divisional Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the fact that the divisional campaign scheduled for September 4, 5 and 6 comes so close to tlie Columbus convention, this dlvi sional campaign will be canceled. No arrangements, therefore, should be made by the brethren for any divisional campaign on those dates. This will enable the brethren to be better equipped to go to the Columbus convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">this special campaign and let them know about the special offer. With tlie long summer evenings back calls in the country and city territory will be a pleasure. Make several every week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">6. “Exposed” Meetings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">At every public meeting where you play the records on “Exposed” or “Religion and Chbistianity” display a complete set of the bound books and booklets. Let the chairman make mention of the special offer of six bound books on a contribution of one dollar at the conclusion of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let every publisher, pioneer, auxiliary and company prepare immediately for this special campaign. Check over your stock. See that you have a good supply of every bound book. Emphasize this campaign at every service meeting. Discuss ways and means of placing more books. Have the publishers relate their helpful experiences. See that every publisher has a supply of bound books, new testimony card and other equipment for this bound book period; also plenty of territory. If in your group there are newly Interested ones who have not yet started in the w’itness work, do what you can to help them take part in this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">750,000 Bound Books Our Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Can we place 750,000 bound books from July 1 to September 12? We believe so. if every publisher will do his part. To illustrate: If each of I he 2.000 pioneers on our list placed but three 6-book combinations per week; if 1,000 auxiliaries averaged only five 6-book combinations during the entire period; and if 25,000 company publishers averaged but two 6-book combinations and one ,3-book combination, the totals would be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;360,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Auxiliaries &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30,000</span></p>

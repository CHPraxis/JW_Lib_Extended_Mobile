<p><span class="font1">You will find in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> a personal letter from Brother Rutherford outlining the special testimony period designated “Faithful Wabbiob”, March 27 to April 4, inclusive. This testimony period should be a most blessed occasion and a time vrhen every one of those in the Lord’s organization will put forth extraordinary effort to be in the field. The Memorial being celebrated March 26 will forcefully impress upon each one of the faithful the great privilege granted them of associating with one another in the “Faithful Warrior” period of witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Read and study Brother Rutherford’s letter carefully. Study it in your service meetings, in preparation for this very important worldwide united witness. Who is the Faithful Wabbiob? Why this testimony period? What is your individual privilege and responsibility in connection therewith? What is to be done during the period? Let every publisher be prepared and strengthened by the message of the letter, and then proceed to have a full share in the testimony period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work of this period, which is a special effort on the part of those of the remnant and of the Jonadab class in carrying the message of God’s kingdom to the people, goes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">right hand in hand with the phonograph campaign current then, and during the testimony period the phonograph campaign is part of that special effort of more time in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking of Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here are nine days in this period for the Lord's people to make the most of. The entire setup of this occasion emphasizes its scope and importance. First of all, it is a part of Jehovah’s “strange work” by Christ Jesus, and is a world-wide</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font1">effort of all in unison. In every part of the earth where men and women are serving the Lord this period will see them putting forth an extra effort. In strong contrast to religion, which parades itself with great display throughout the “Easter” season, Christianity, obedience to God’s commandments, presses the war against devil religion. The evening of the 26th is the time of the Christians’ Memorial, instituted by the Faithful Warrior, and to the name of Jehovah. How good it is to have this important celebration of Memorial just preceding the “Faithful Wabbiob” testimony period, which begins</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To the Faithful in All the Earth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The testimony period beginning March 27 is designated ‘ ‘ Faithful Warrior”. All persons now on the earth and who are devoted to Jehovah God are on the side of Christ Jesus, his “Faithful Warrior”. Such persons are known as the remnant and the Jona-dabs. The command of Jehovah to them is: “Arise ye . . . against her in battle.” Christ Jesus, the Faithful Warrior, is now engaged in making war on organized religion known as “Babylon”, the Devil's organization, that deceives the people and fights against God. That is God’s “strange work”, because it exposes the hypocrisy and duplicity of those who have used the name of God and Christ to deceive the people and turn them away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every person now on the earth and who is on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom is privileged to feed at the Lord’s table and to learn of the unfolding of prophecy, which is meat in due season for him, and which is provided by the Lord for his comfort and hope. Every one of such is duty-bound to obey God’s commandments, and those who have opportunity to obey and who fail or refuse will suffer the consequences. (Acts 3: 23) To obey the Lord’s commandments everyone who is on the side of the Lord must now fearlessly bear testimony against the enemy and to the name and praise of Jehovah and his kingdom. This letter is merely a reminder, dear brethren, of your privilege and obligation. If you would maintain your integrity toward Jehovah you will joyfully obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special periods for giving testimony are fixed in order that all of God’s people throughout the earth may, at the same time, send up a shout to the honor of his holy name. The “Faithful Warrior” testimony period should see every one of the faithful in the field presenting the message of the Lord to the people. This you will do</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">by the use of the transcription machine, and the phonograph, and by presenting to the people the printed message. A special combination of books is made available for this testimony period. Let everyone place as many combinations as possible in the hands of the people. Jehovah’s “warning” must be given to those who claim to be Christians. (Ezekiel 33:7-9) The message of the kingdom and the name of Jehovah must be proclaimed to all nations as a witness. Do not concern yourself about who will and who will not die at Armageddon, but concern yourself about your own duty to deliver the message as God commands. The Lord will take care of the result.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">That part of the war which is the “strange work” is now on. Will you perform your part therein in obedience to God’s commandment? That work will be completed in due time, and then follows “his strange act”. Be alert and be diligent in this day of conflict between wickedness and righteousness. May the Father of mercies and God of all comfort continue to strengthen and bless</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">On your report card for the month of April each company servant (and any isolated pioneers or other publishers) is to note the total number of persons attending the meeting at which the Memorial is celebrated., after 6: 00 p.m., March 26. This information is to be given at the bottom of the report card. In the space at the bottom of the card write “Total Attending Memorial _________</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Number Partaking of the Emblems .........” In addition to reporting the total attending, you will report the number of those in attendance who partake of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A.I1 will with profit attend the Memorial celebration, including those of the Jonadab class, who do not themselves partake of the emblems. All of the Lord’s people, of the anointed or of the Jonadab class, will join in the united testimony to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Special Folder for Phonograph and Transcription Meetings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">There is much work to be done shortly in the arranging of phonograph and transcription meetings, as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s recent letter sent to all companies, pioneers and auxiliaries. All persons should have the opportunity of attending these meetings as they are arranged in each territory. For the purpose of aiding the brethren in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">this campaign, the Society has prepared a very neat folder setting out the importance of hearing the lectures of Judge Rutherford. Space Is provided for stamping in the name and address and time of meeting. This can be done with the regular rubber stamp sets which the Society provides. When working a territory where you have arranged for a phonograph meeting or transcription meeting, the company servant should see to it that sufficient of these folders are stamped and given to the publishers for distribution at every home. These folders will be provided at 40c a thousand to companies and auxiliaries; and free to pioneers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calling the Big Work</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Are All</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Your Publishers at It?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">How is your campaign of back-calling with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font1"> booklet on petition signers coming along?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many petition names were obtained in small towns and rural territory which are difficult to reach at this season of the year. This should not deter us from making personal contact with the people, however. The advantage of making a personal contact with the people by use of the phonograph cannot be overstressed. We have gone beyond the place where we simply leave literature with the people and go on. We are to aid the people of good will in getting an understanding of the issues now imminent, and this can be accomplished only by personal contact, phonograph meetings, and inviting the people to studies where they can discuss the Kingdom truths and ask questions pertaining to these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, even though it entails inconvenience, this contact should be made. It is a vital and necessary feature of the work the Lord is now having done in the earth. Therefore it requires careful planning. Your territory should be laid out with care and consideration. Arrange for the publishers to go first to the cities, towns and main highways that are open at this season of the year. See that these territories are completely worked and the people who signed the petition in these areas provided with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font1">booklet and such other literature as they will accept. Then, as the weather improves, expand your activities to include territory that is now inaccessible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font1"> I) the next day, Saturday the 27th! Consistent with the Memorial, service will be performed by Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturdays and Sundays</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Saturday the period opens. Why not with all-day service? And Sunday is “Easter Sunday”, another religious festival, and to be taken advantage of by every one of the Lord’s people in the warfare of uncovering God’s enemies. During the weekdays of Monday the 29th to Friday the 2d, let witnessing parties be arranged for each day. Plan the work carefully, attending to all details, so all the publishers can be advised at the service meetings and can take part in the service during the week. Let the witnessing parties remain in the field several hours, making a good day of it each time they go out. This will increase the number of hours. In the evenings, let back calls be made, phonograph work be carried on, and real time put in. This international period calls for extra effort. Then the period closes with the week end of Saturday and Sunday the 3d and 4th, two more full days for the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You remember the corresponding spring testimony period of a year ago, “His Strange Work” testimony period, April 4 to 12, when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">was released to the public. Jehovah blessed the efforts of his people, and it marked a high point in the warfare between religion and Christianity. Look up your records and find out what your company did then;</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Company meetings for study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> should be had Sundays, afternoon or evening, as the company may decide. This is published notwithstanding what has heretofore appeared in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> and this is the Society’s policy and recommendation, by direction of the president.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Special Notice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers and auxiliaries should not take orders from the company publishers for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> phonographs, books or anything of this nature and forward them to the Society's office as pioneer orders. Pioneers should confine all their placements to the general public or people of good will, to people not associated with company organizations. All who attend regular company meetings should order their requirements through the company servant or stockkeeper.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Sound Car Equipment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The Society is able to rebuild transcription machines that have been manufactured at 117 Adams Street into sound car equipment. The horn, a powerful loud-speaker and an additional power pack is supplied. We will recondition the transcription machine and make it dual speed, 33 J- and 78-r.p.m., if it is not already that way. Write the Society in regard to adding sound car equipment to your present transcription machine, and the cost of doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">discuss this in your service meetings, and make definite plans so that you can actually increase your time and results during “Faithful Wabkiob” testimony period this year. Jehovah lias led his people a long way during the past year, and we now see so raueh more clearly the opposing forces in the war now on, and our own privileges and responsibilities. With the additional equipment now in our hands, the clearer vision, a greater effort on our part which should be the case with increased enthusiasm, and Jehovah’s rich blessing on our work, “Faithful Warbiob” testimony period should surpass even the previous spring international period in number of publishers and of hours and in literature placed. What are YOU going to do to accomplish this? Set your quota of hours; get in the time. Many will exceed the general quota of ten hours for company publishers, twenty for auxiliaries, and forty for pioneers, for the nine days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is a booklet campaign. The combination to be pushed for this testimony period is six booklets, on a contribution of 25c, which combination will include the two new self-covered booklets, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font1"> The four colored-cover booklets to be used may be the following: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Angels, What You Need, Supremacy,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing.</span><span class="font1"> If any one of these runs short, then others may be substituted. Check over your stock, and order at once all you will need. See that all petition signers get </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font1"> even if they do not take the entire combination. Carry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> of course, and place bound books at every opportunity. It is always in order to substitute other than the regular campaign pieces when some of the booklets in the special combination are already had by the people; and this, of course, necessitates the publishers’ carrying a good assortment at all times. In view of the work that will be done during the period with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font1"> booklet and phonographs,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Use Your Renewal Slip for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and</span></h4>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Golden Age</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is much time lost at the subscription desks due to the fact that the brethren do not use the renewal slips which they receive in their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> magazines. These slips are always numbered, and if you fill these out properly, instead of writing a letter, and send them in with your remittance, it means that the office here will not have to copy your name and address onto slips for our file. All you need to send to the office is the renewal slip (filled out) and a money order; then no letter need accompany renewals or new subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company servants will greatly help the work of the office if they will send letter listing each individual subscriber and also enclose subscription slip for each individual as well as a money order to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name of the company servant should appear on each renewal or subscription slip sent in by the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">no special testimony card is being prepared for the above combination of six booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The territory should be carefully selected and planned by the company servant and service committee to enable the most effective witness to be given during this period, and will depend measurably on what has been done previously in the current campaign. Generally, thickly settled urban territory or small towns will be most suitable. Work such territory thoroughly, not, of course, confining the work to only those who have signed the petition, but reaching everyone in the area covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sound servants, here is work for you to do, in seeing that all of the company sound equipment is kept busy during the period, having the co-operation of all the company publishers in using not only the phonographs, but also the sound cars and transcription machines. The brethren appreciate the importance and value of the use of the phonographs in the witness work now more than ever before, because of the many wonderful experiences they are having in the use of the same, and the clear indication from the Lord as to the propriety and necessity of their use at this time. This is one point particularly stressed in Brother Rutherford’s letter. Complete arrangements for all details of your sound work at your service meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This testimony period begins March 27. To make it convenient for all to report uniformly, will all follow the following procedure:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">End March with the 26th. At that time send in the report for March, including March 1 to 26. Report all work from March 27 to April 30 inclusive on the April report card. On the April card also report the entile testimony period, March 27 to April 4. Also, on your report for the month of April, make your report of the total number attending the Memorial celebration and the number partaking of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The message of the kingdom and the name of Jehovah must be proclaimed to all nations as a witness. Do not concern yourself about who will and who will not die at Armageddon, but concern yourself about your own duty to deliver the message as God commands. The Lord will take care of the results.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Divisional Campaigns</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The dates set aside for divisional activity during 1937 are May 29 and 30 and September 4, 5 and 6—two divisional campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All divisional servants who have not been notified to the contrary will continue to serve in that capacity during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two divisional campaigns scheduled for 1937 should receive the whole-hearted and enthusiastic support of all the brethren. Points should be chosen where a real witness can be given on both occasions, giving preference, of course, to trouble points where you are receiving opposition from the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The divisional servant should immediately contact all company servants in his division and receive from them their recommendation of two points or sections to be covered in these campaigns. These recommendations the divisional servant will assemble and carefully consider and submit to the Society the two receiving the most votes. This information should be in the Society’s office by March 15, so that the recommendations may be considered and approved in plenty of time for the first campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Only territory that is assigned to the companies within the division is to be witnessed to. Unassigned territory or pioneer territory should not be worked without special permission.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Coupons</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The Premium Department advises that after January 1, 1937, they are not permitted to redeem Borden coupons for cash, but will redeem them for merchandise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nestle’s Milk Products, Inc., advised that they would be unable to continue their cash arrangement after the end of the year, namely, December 31, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We believe they sent forth a letter to this effect to all the brethren who have been sending them labels.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Year So Far</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Below is the table showing the report of the United States and all other territory directly under the Brooklyn office for the first four months of the current fiscal year compared with the same time a year ago. This report should have the attention of every Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make up a similar report for your own company, comparing your work this year with that of a year ago, for the four months of October to January inclusive. See just what your local organization is doing, and, as far as possible, let each publisher consider his own individual activity in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number of bound books is still a little ahead, and that of publishers shows an increase; every other item is less than a year ago. These totals are the results of the efforts of many individuals. Whatever tends to decrease the witness is to be eliminated; those things that increase the witness are to be striven for earnestly. The Lord’s work must now be done. Ask yourself, “Am I in any way responsible for the decrease in time?” Let each company make it a unit responsibility to make up the decrease during the remaining months of the year.</span></p>

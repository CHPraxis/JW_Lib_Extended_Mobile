<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>All the Remnant and Jonadabs Take Part</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Made Your Plans?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s Faithful Warrior, Christ Jesus, has now thrown open the granary and storehouse of Jehovah to those people of good will who desire preservation and life according to the Lord's provision for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah has clearly revealed to his people the relationship of himself and his King, Christ Jesus, to all creatures who will have his approval now. We see as never before the true history of Mordecai and Naomi, their privileges and responsibility in the Lord’s organization; also that of Ruth, Esther and Benjamin and their position and why so many of them endured such persecution in more recent years. We also discern the other ten brethren of Joseph and where they have been during recent years and what we may now expect concerning them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why has the Lord given his people this vision? Because the time has come for Jehovah to send forth his witnesses to declare his message of consolation to these hungry souls. He says to them through his witnesses, “Go unto my Servant, Christ Jesus, and whatsoever lie saith unto you, do it, and ye shall live.” To this end he has given us millions of books and booklets, thousands upon thousands of sound machines, including sound cars, transcription machines and phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He has prepared his organization at headquarters and throughout the earth, subdividing it into pioneers, auxiliaries and companies with the company organization under its service committee, company servant and other members placed in the body for the purpose of carrying out the work that he has now for his people. This organization manufactures, ships and distributes this food that the Lord has stored up for the “other sheep” and people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has done his part very thoroughly. Are we doing ours? During this “Faithful Warrior” period, March 27 to April 4, are we putting forth an exceptional effort to co-operate in this special proclamation that the Lord has arranged? These special periods are also directed by the Lord and arranged for that purpose. Each one should recognize this and arrange accordingly. These questions each one must answer for himself. The Lord will be satisfied with nothing less than faithfulness on the part of his people. Therefore, carefully consider your time and your arrangements and plan to devote as much time as possible to the Kingdom service during the remainder of this period, and thereafter, of course, to the extent that you are able to carry it on.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Organization</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">United Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Push the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As scheduled In the “Outline for Weekly Service Meetings” for March, all during the month you have for consideration at each service meeting the letter of Brother Rutherford, dated January 16, setting forth the new work with the new phonograph lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Continue to give this campaign careful attention at the service meetings during April, and continue to give careful consideration to the letter, so your campaign will go forward in harmony therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Efficient organization by every unit, close co-opebation by all publishers, and united effort by all of the Lord’s people are necessary to put the special work across as it should be done. The Society will be glad to hear from the companies and others of the progress of this work throughout your respective portions of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Faithful Warrior” Testimony Period Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">End March with the 26th</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of the entire testimony period “Faithful Warrior”, March 27 to April 4 inclusive, is to be made on the report card on which you report for the month of April, and the work of the entire period is to be included in the work of the month of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">End March with the 26th, and immediately after the 26th send in your report for the month of March, reporting the work of March 1 to 26 inclusive. The April report will be for March 27 to April 30 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A sample copy of the new folder to be used In connection with the transcription meetings and phonograph meetings is enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> They are very attractive, and we believe they will aid in drawing the attention of the people to the meeting place. They also have adequate space for local information, and should be left with everybody in the area that is covered for a particular meeting. These can be had at 40c a thousand. Order with freight shipments whenever possible. Pioneers are furnished them free.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Is Blessing the Phonograph Work </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Having a Share in It?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here Are Some Phonograph Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord is blessing this work in a remarkable way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the Greater New York units reports the following results of the back calls made on petition signers: “Of the 1500 calls already made on petition signers, 600 were reported as interested in the Kingdom and require further contact. We expect to call on these people with the phonograph and invite them to the phonograph series in their neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From Istanbul, Turkey, we have a report: “I played the records In the English and American embassies. One lady took the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font2">showed much interest and Invited me to play the records in her home that others may hear them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From Egypt: “This month we made use of the phonograph in many homes. It is an excellent means to give the message, and the people do give attention to the message presented by the phonograph. We have orders for four phonographs by interested people. We hope to place many more books in the hands of the people as the result of the use of the phonograph.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A pioneer reports an experience he had when making a back call with the phonograph on six men living in a box car, employed as railway section gang. “After hearing the phonograph I placed 2 Bibles, 3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> 12 booklets and 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> subscription. All were interested.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another: “Where five men were building a house, two colored and three white, after hearing the message ‘Peace Messengers’, they took 2 Bibles, 4 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and 15 booklets. The boss asked me to play some more, which I did, and when the meeting was over we had gone twen</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Read Brother Rutherford’s Letter at Memorial</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember to Make Your Memorial Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is recommended that Brother Rutherford’s letter “To the Faithful in All the Earth”, appearing in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and March (1937) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> be read at the Memorial service of each assembly of the Lord’s people, emphasizing the great privilege of participating in the actuality of what is to be commemorated in the symbols the anointed partake of, and the Jonadabs also joining in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is anxious to receive as soon as possible a complete report showing the total attendance at Memorial, and of these the numty minutes over the time that they should have been back to work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another: The same brother, with another section gang on the railroad, says: “I asked the boss if they would like to hear a good lecture. He said, ■We have only five minutes left.’ I said, ’My lecture is only </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4j</span><span class="font2"> minutes.’ He said, ‘Let’s hear it.’ I set up quick and played ‘Peace Messengers’. I placed 2 Bibles, 5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and 15 booklets in five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Use of Sound Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“When engaged in the actual use of the car we meet with some interference. Many times people come up and ask us to stop, as someone is sick or asleep. We politely ask the complainant for his name and address to file as a reason for not completing the setup. If they are sincere they will do this without hesitation; otherwise they get angry and abusive, and then the program continues. It is a psychological point which works very well. We have no desire to disturb anyone, but do not like to be bluffed out of our rights, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A great nuisance on Sunday is tile churches. When we encounter one in our territory we simply go into it and see if they are holding their services. Sometimes they will tell us that they are not convening for ten or fifteen minutes yet; so we utilize that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Another nuisance is in the form of police officers who take it upon themselves to come out and say that they have been sent to stop us. We then close up and go directly to the chief or other superior city officer. Sometimes, as very recently in the city of ------- and also in -------,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we learned that the officers had taken it upon themselves to stop the work, and we were told to continue. When an officer comes up in an abu-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Letter Comes with This </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is a letter which is to be read to all of the brethren at your service meetings during the remainder of March and in April. Let all consider what they can do to have a larger share in the witness work in accordance with this letter as company publishers, auxiliaries and pioneers. The letter should not be merely casually read, but given real consideration.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Think of How Many Places You Could Put One</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Just a little more than a year ago the electric signs were made available for the brethren to use in advertising the Kingdom message. Several thousand have since been supplied to Jehovah’s people throughout the land, and these are being put to good use in the homes of the publishers, homes of newly interested persons, places of business of the brethren or of other people, at the companies’ headquarters, various halls or other meeting places, and elsewhere, where they can be seen by people passing by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is quite evident that there are thousands of homes of the brethren, meeting places, and other locations where these signs could be used advantageously which have not been equipped so far. Do you have a sign in your own home? In your company headquarters? In the homes and business places of interested persons in your territory? At the various places where your service meetings, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Richcn</span><span class="font2"> studies, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies and any other meetings are held?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now there comes the new work with the phonograph records as outlined in Brother Rutherford's letter of January 1G. A great many halls and other places will be utilized for these phonograph and transcription meetings. Here are splendid opportunities to use the electric signs, and certainly should be taken advantage of. Not only will the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> be advertised by the signs, but they will be an aid to the people in locating the hall or other meeting place where lectures and studies are held. This is the time of identi-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>New Catalog</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A reprint of the catalog has been made, bringing it up to date. Beautiful illustrations of all books and booklets appear. It is well for the publishers to carry with them a copy of the catalog as a prospectus. The illustrations in the back of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font2">book can be used for the same purpose. Any brethren desiring a copy of the new catalog can order through the company servant. They can be had at 2jc each. A remittance should accompany all orders.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Has Your </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Expired?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">If it has you should renew, so that you may eat the food provided regularly through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">which is the Lord’s channel for feeding his people. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> continues to bring you information of real interest and news about the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. It will be greatly appreciated and help considerably if in renewing your subscriptions you will always use the subscription blank which is sent in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> one month before your subscription expires. All the subscriber needs to do is to fill in his name and address and attach to his remittance and mail to The WATCH TOWER or The GOLDEN AGE. It will be given prompt attention. There is no need to send a letter with the subscription blank. Your using these renewal slips will aid in prompt handling of your subscription. Write plainly, and road your slip carefully after filling it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If associated with a company, renew through the local company servant ; and the company servant will please read last month’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">as to what he should do. fication. The electric signs help to identify those on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This sign is manufactured by the Society. It has a beautiful white enameled metal cabinet 12 by 16 inches with a glass front, back of which glass the sign itself is inserted, through which an electric light shines. The metal cabinet is built in the form of a reflector, the electric light being located in the cabinet behind the sign and equipped with a flasher. The sign proper is made up in white, yellow, green and red, presenting a beautiful and striking appearance, and is good in daylight as well as at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sign now reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">HOW TO OBTAIN</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>RICHES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">THAT ENDURE Inquire Within</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For local information the brethren may cut their own cardboard stencils with the proper wording and make up such additional inserts as they need. Keep busy the signs you now have, and obtain as many additional as you can use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society will fill orders at once, shipped to any address, at $1.50 each, remittance to accompany order. The signs come complete with cord, flasher and electric bulb, and the insert reading as shown above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">-All companies should order these signs through the company servant, and in seis of two, if possible, for convenience in packing and shipping.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To avoid confusion and to Insure prompt attention, address coupons forwarded to the Premium Dept., 17 Sussex St., Jersey City, N. J.. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Attention of Grace Lee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much confusion, and the possibility of the parcel’s being lost entirely, will be avoided if this is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There Is a Lot of It for Pioneer Assignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Spring and summer, open roads, busy country people, the time to get &quot;out in the sticks” and carry the Kingdom message to those who are not in the territory of any company. This is the time for pioneers to get their summer territory, if they have not already done so, and the time for those company publishers to arrange to serve as pioneers if they can do so, and reach those sections of the country which cannot get the Kingdom message by personal contact unless isolated publishers go to them. Many pioneers who have been spending the winter in cities with companies will now be able to take to the road and witness far afield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much has been done in the southern states this past winter, while much of the territory of other states has not been reached at all during that time. Write us, and we shall be glad to give you definite information on the counties open in the states you inquire about. At the present time there is considerable territory open in the following states especially: Arkansas (northern),Iowa, Kentucky. Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota. South Dakota, Tennessee. Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. There continues to be a great deal of business territory in ' all eastern states having large cities.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Some of the brethren have misunderstood how this should be done. A distinction should be made at the beginning, in this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special report requested by the Society applies only to the petition signers. All other </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">booklets placed are to be placed the same as any other booklet in the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In your regular monthly report, pioneers, auxiliaries and companies are to report in their respective reports all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets placed with the people, including them with the other booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fact that pioneers and auxiliaries in company territory are requested to give certain information to the company servant when the territory is covered does not change the regular report arrangement. Each group is to make its complete report to the Society of all literature placed, including the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If pioneers or auxiliaries have failed to report all their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">booklets in the past, thinking that this should be turned over to the company servant, they will please include in their next report all such booklets placed; and any company servants who have misunderstood the matter and included in their reports </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets reported by pioneers or auxiliaries, they will please deduct these booklets from their next report, so that this matter may be straightened out.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Radio Folder</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A reprint has been made of the radio folder announcing the weekly transcriptions of Brother Rutherford. This has been brought up to date, having all the stations under contract listed. Radio folders can be used to good advantage locally by stamping right after the word “TELEPHONE” your local telephone number. This will give the persons receiving these folders the opportunity of phoning if they wish to have the phonograph service brought to their own home. If you so desire you can stamp a local address too. The thing we want to do now is to give all the people opportunity to contact Jehovah’s witnesses, that they may be fully informed of the truth. The pioneers will be furnished these folders free on order. To companies, 40c per thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font2"> 4) sive manner and demands that the program be shut off, we have sometimes told him to turn the key himself and stop the program. We say this nicely, as if we didn’t care, but they will never do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Our best results have been obtained by going in a very informal way to the proper officer in a town and merely telling him that we are scheduled to use the sound car of Jehovah’s witnesses in his town, and inviting his co-operation so that we may use it most effectively. It sometimes happens that the officer in question will say it can’t be done. In this case we do not dispute the matter with him, but just say cheerfully, ‘All right, but will you please give us a copy of your ordinance to that effect so that I may file it with my report of ray day’s activity, as a reason why I did not operate here?’ In nearly all instances there is no such ordinance, and this places the officer in a very awkward position. He will usually tell you to go ahead until he gets a complaint.. .. Where an ordinance is shown us which apparently does not cover sound cars, we politely ask the of-thereafter as all the petition signers are called upon, should be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society assumes the obligation of providing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets for all petition signers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companies are to supply sufficient copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet to company publishers, pioneers, and auxiliaries for petition signers in the respective territories as shown on slips they hand out to these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When that territory is completed the following information is given to the company servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets placed with petition signers. Number of petition signers who con-Iributed for the booklet, and the number who did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers and auxiliaries will turn in with their report the entire contribution received. Pioneers may turn in the regular pioneer rate for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets for which they received a contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Any of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklets supplied free by the Society for petition signers and given out and used by the publishers in the regular house-to-house work should be replaced with booklets ordered by the company, pioneer or auxiliary subsequently for their regular service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society will supply each company with a special form on which to make this report in ample time for this report to be sent in. This form will be mailed to all companies with their March 31 Statement.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Pick Up Your Shipments</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers, auxiliaries and company servants should always have in mind that the Society ships the cheapest way. If by freight, then a bill of lading is sent to you and you know on what railroad it is coming. If the shipment is too small for freight, then it goes either by mail or by express, whichever is the cheaper. Please be on the lookout for both these places when you have placed an order. Sometimes shipments are left to lie in the express office and cartons are returned by the express company, informing us that the party is unknown and that no call was made. Always be very careful to make inquiry at both places, post office and express office, especially if you are leaving town, and in that event leave your forwarding address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ficer to please underscore the portion which applies to us, as we are unable to understand it and could not explain It in our report. This has always resulted in a compromise on the officer’s part and we operate as usual. Even where a good ordinance does exist we are often permitted to operate. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“One Sunday morning recently we went to ------, which has such an</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ordinance. I asked permission to speak to the chief. The chief told me of their ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“When he had finished saying that he was very sorry but he could not permit us to operate, I asked what would have happened if we had just gone ahead with our work instead of coming down here. He said they would have been compelled to come out and stop us as soon as they had a complaint. I answered that he was apparently anticipating complaints which I did not believe would be forthcoming. Then I told him that we would go right ahead with our work as if I had not talked with him, and if he had any complaints later on we would take it up from that point. As usual, we finished our day’s work without interference.”</span></p>

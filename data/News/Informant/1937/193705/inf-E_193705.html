<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Honest-hearted Must Be Fed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah by his prophet states: “If I whet my glittering swobd, and mine hand take hold on Judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them (hat hate me.” (Deut. 32:41) Who is the “Glittering Sword” of the Most High, the One who will execute the judgments of Jehovah on iris enemies, destroying those who maintain hate against Jehovah? The Calendar says: &quot;Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s ‘Glittering Sword’, with which unrighteousness shall be destroyed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Directing the present warfare, Jehovah’s &quot;Glittering Sword” leads his people forward. The special testimony periods bear titles appropriate to the work to be done, and from June 5 to 13, inclusive, Is the special testimony period designated “Glittering Sword”. Everyone who really loves the I,ord, regardless of the length of time he or she has known of God’s truth, has the privilege and is charged witli the responsibility of sharing enthusiastically in the work of this important period, “Glittering Sword.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Glittering Sword” Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A remarkable combination of books and booklets will be used for this period. It is a special offer for the nine days only, and is composed of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Preservation, Protection. Uncovered, Armageddon,</span><span class="font2"> and a colored-cover booklet, any one you desire, but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font2"> is to be placed if the person does not already have it. Here you have a combination of two bound books and four booklets, to be placed on the special contribution of fifty cents for the combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Have a good stock of all of these on hand. With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> you will receive a special order blank, which is to be sent in at once, so shipments can be made and you will have your stock in plenty of time. The new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon,</span><span class="font2"> will not be consigned, but you are to order what you want of them, a good supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the person witnessed to has either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font2"> it will be all right for you to substitute in this case any of the other bound books to make up the complete combination at the special contribution. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">If only two books and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">are desired the contribution can be forty cents, or the four booklets on a ten-cent contribution, for this period only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rate at which the pioneers now obtain the literature will enable them to make this special offer to the people, and so it will not be necessary for the Society to give them credit on the combinations they place. To enable the auxiliaries and companies to have this special offer, they should show at the bottom of their report cards for June the number of complete combinations of the two bound books and the four booklets they place during the nine days of the “Glittering Swobd” period on the special contribution of 50c. From these report cards we can give credit on the auxiliary and company accounts respectively of 8c and 6Jc for each combination. Report In this manner all combinations, English or foreign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In making their reports to the company servant, the company publishers should Indicate on their report slips the combinations placed In the same manner, and get a refund of 6Jc a combination, having obtained ail literature from the stockkeeper originally at the regular company rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, you understand that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet is to be given to anyone who is unable to make a contribution, if he promises to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In placing literature with people reading a foreign language, make up a like special combination in their language, using two bound books and three self-covered and one coloredcover booklet in that particular language. If necessary use two foreign bound books and the English booklets for the children in order to make up the special combination offer to these people not able to read English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font2"> are printed in many languages. In case these are not in print in any particular language, substitute some other bound book. Order all the foreign literature you need.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Rise Up Against Her in Battle”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Campaign Moves On Well</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Are You Doing All You Can to “Let Them Hear”?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Joyful reports are coming in from all parts of the field regarding the special campaign with “Exposed&quot; and “Religion and Christianity” recordings. The brethren are enthused beyond words at the prospect and possibilities of this campaign and are enthusiastically and systematically covering their territory assignments as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s original letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results obtained to date by those who have advised the Society have exceeded their fondest expectations. This, of course, is to be expected. It is the Lord’s time for the work to be carried on, and his purposes will be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some companies, however, have not been so prompt in getting this campaign under way. Some of them have felt that they have no brethren qualified to handle the meetings; others feel that they should finish calling upon the petition signers before undertaking the campaign; while still others feel that this special campaign is only for large companies and does not apply to the smaller units. All of these objections are wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding the first one: Anyone with a knowledge of present truth and the Lord’s purposes relative to the establishment of his kingdom can find sufficient information in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> booklets in support of each point dealt with, with an almost inexhaustible supply of additional scriptures and supporting arguments in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, (loverinnent, Hereafter</span><span class="font2"> and other publications of the Society, so that for anyone who really wishes to apply himself there is no excuse for not being equipped to take care of these meetings. The most competent brethren, of course, should be used first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding the second objection. This indicates a lack of understanding. Both the work of back-calling on petition signers and this special campaign can be carried on simultaneously. In fact, the special campaign is directly connected with the petition work. Each company servant and service committee should arrange to have the names of all petition signers in each territory set </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">column 1}</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Your Part Advertising</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The Hierarchy did not come through. Even though 2,600,000 persons signed the petition, the Hierarchy spurned it. This number represents only a small portion of those who would have signed had time allowed for us to call on them. However, all shall hear, whether it be by the calling at their homes with the records and phonograph, or by reading the booklet, or by the big broadcast. What a glorious work the Lord has given us, to expose the Devil’s religion! For months now the Lord’s organization has been arranging so that all might have the truth as set forth by Brother Rutherford in his lecture “Exposed”. Excellent work has been accomplished with the phonograph and these records, and it will continue even more vigorously, as this work is gaining momentum every day. Now with this nation-wide broadcast, Brother Rutherford, by the Lord’s grace, will speak to millions more over radio stations that the Hierarchy says we may not use. Your share in this big broadcast, in addition to other work, will be to advertise the 150 stations, or rather, the one station in your community. Here are some suggestions :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Between now and the end of this series of six broadcasts, mention Judge Rutherford’s lecture “Exposed” to everyone you meet, whether this be in your regular door-to-door witnessing or in the shop, to the butcher, the baker, or whomsoever you meet. Tell them the station, the time and date. Remember, this is a big broadside being let loose on the Devil’s crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society will be able to supply only the eastern sections of the United States with folders, as the time is too short to ship to all parts of the country, and stations are still signing up to broadcast “Exposed”. Consignments will be made from Brooklyn only. When you receive your consignment of radio folders, distribute them to the best advantage. Use them in your regular witness work and always carry a few with you to give to your friends and acquaintances you meet. Shipment of these will be made around April 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Means of Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sound car and your transcription machines are loud speakers and will make good announcers of this broadcast. Use them often in conjunction with all of your field activity. Make announcement of the broadcast at every meeting, and invite all strangers to announce the broadcast. Let’s get everybody talking about “Exposed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Signs can be used to good advan-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">। (Continued on page</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 8. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">column</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Another New Booklet —and a Thriller I</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">This Is a new booklet by Brother Rutherford, and, to say the least, it is a thriller. Every one of the anointed and of the great multitude in the Lord’s organization will want a share in the distribution of this timely message. Brother Rutherford has delivered the lecture contained in this booklet in many parts of “Christendom”, and people who were unable to hear him will be anxious to obtain this booklet. Many of the brethren in the United States will recall the shout of “Aye” in response to the masterly delivery of this most important message. Get your personal copy for study now, and be prepared for the next campaign. Remember, the resolution called for world-wide distribution. Let’s get at it with real energy in the June campaign. Order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column S') </span><span class="font2">aside for this campaign work, arranged in an orderly manner and given to the publishers who are going to work that territory with the phonograph and literature, inviting the people to the hall provided. When the homes of the petition signers are reached, special invitations are Issued to these and a direct connection can be established between the petition they signed and these special meetings, so that both works should go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The third objection is no objection at all. This special campaign Is for all companies, large and small. No one has the right to withhold from the people in their respective territory this provision which the Lord has made for them; and any who persist in doing so cannot be pleasing to Jehovah. In this connection Brother Rutherford says in his letter: &quot;Jehovah has given to his people this emphatic command: 'Rise up against her in battle.’ With zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house we must obey and will gladly do so.” “All witnesses for the Lord must be unusually diligent to carry the truth to the people now, and this work must be completed before Armageddon, which will follow shortly after the Hierarchy has reached the zenith of Its arrogance and power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are the Lord’s instructions to his people through his organization, and are not discretionary, but entirely mandatory. Each and every</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2) “Glittering Sword” Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Summer territory, such outlying rural or small-town territory as you have yet to go over to call on any possible remaining petition signers, and also with the new recorded lectures “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity”. All of these features of the witness are to be worked together. Plan the territory. Let all have individual assignments of city territory or other territory they can reach in addition to their work with witnessing groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Glittering Sword” Sound Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sound cars, transcription machines and phonographs can be used to such a great advantage in this period. The entire set-up of the witness work calls for intensive sound service, especially with the phonograph at the homes of the people, and a thorough personal advertising of the “Exposed” meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just consider what Jehovah places In our hands at this time, and for this period. The big question is concerning Jehovah’s vindication, Arma</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Phonograph Orders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">It has been a real joy to see the zeal of the brethren in wanting to get into this new phonograph work, and their orders have literally &quot;swamped&quot; the factory. We are pleased to report that we are 2,500 orders behind in manufacturing. The force on phonograph production has been increased. Every effort is being made to get these orders out just as soon as possible. We ask all to be patient, as the orders are now being tilled according to the date that they were received. Those of you who have not placed your orders, do it immediately ; because the sooner your order is placed, the sooner it will come to the top of the list lor shipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">unit must accept the responsibility for seeing that these provisions of the Lord are carried to the people in their respective territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are some publishers who felt that if they had no phonograph they should not have anything to do with this special series. This is incorrect. All publishers who have phonographs should take them into the territory and use them as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s letter. Those who do not have phonographs should take the literature (including in all combinations </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> booklets) and a special announcement of the meeting and work the territory with these, inviting all they contact to attend the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This special campaign is to be worked into every special period also. Do not drop the campaign and break up a series of meetings, expecting to pick them up again after the special period has ended. That would prove very disastrous to those meetings. With proper thought and careful planning this campaign can very easily be worked Into each special period without retarding It in the least. In fact, the testimony period will be an added stimulus to this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brethren having sound cars may use records P-101 and P-102 In their territory. As an announcement they may read the Invitation on the special announcement slip Inviting the people to the meeting in that area and let the publishers with the phonographs use the “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” records, P-61-a to P-96-r, in the homes and discuss them with the people for the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each and every one joyfully do his part in carrying this campaign to a successful conclusion. This campaign and Brother Rutherford’s letter should receive consideration at each service meeting.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>I How to Work Territory</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Put In Hours</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">It seems well to give some consideration to the method of working territory. A survey demonstrates that some car drivers place publishers in the territory and leave them for four or five hours without calling back to see if they have sufficient territory, literature and other requirements, while other car drivers pick up their publishers every few houses and drop them down in another territory and thus the car is continually going and the driver is unable to do any witnessing. Both attitudes are extreme and entirely wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The car drivers should have their territory checked up and should put the publishers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> work with sufficient territory to last them two or three hours. They should call back, however, every hour and a half or two hours to see how the workers are getting along. This is necessary now when the phonograph is being used. Sometimes they get into homes where it is possible they may place all their literature or a good proportion of it. Therefore careful attention should be given to seeing that their stock is replenished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The car driver who Is continually picking up and dropping workers every few houses not only is wasting his own time when he might be witnessing but Is also wasting a lot of money for gasoline that could be used to better advantage in the Lord’s service. Therefore, all company servants should Instruct the car drivers to give the publishers sufficient territory to last them for a few hours and then go to work themselves, and in about an hour or hour and a half make the rounds to see that all publishers have territory, literature, etc., and then go back to work again. In this way the publishers and the car driver are witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In working territory publishers should always work around the</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Have All Your</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Petition Signers Been Called On?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">With the March 31 Statement, which will be mailed out about April 10, each company servant will receive a form on which to make the special report of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">booklets placed with the petition signers in the company territory. Make out this report and send it in as soon as the petition work is completed, as soon after April 30 as possible, with the total amount of contributions received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This special report in no way affects the regular reports by all publishers and the regular monthly report by companies of all booklets placed during the month by the company publishers, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered </span><span class="font2">and all others.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Memorial Reports</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">If you did not make your report of the total attendance at the Memorial celebration, and of the number partaking of the emblems, on your report card for March, be sure to report this on your April report card. If you have shown this on your March card, it will not be necessary to repeat the report in April.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Help Light the Way with Electric Signs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">This is to call attention to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and previous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">articles on the electric signs. Order all of these you can use. This is an additional means of advertising the Kingdom message, and the brethren block to meet each other. The phonograph work makes this necessary. One publisher may use his phonograph and spend considerable time at three or four houses, whereas another one may be unable to use the phonograph and will cover considerably more territory, but if they always work around the block until they meet each other there will be no possibility of getting lost or leaving part of the territory uncovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Car</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the publishers are working with the sound car the most effective results are obtained if the car is able to operate as a separate unit, if the workers go ahead with their territory, working according to the regularly prearranged system. The sound car will serve the given area, including that territory, but will not stop to contact the publishers or keep continually checking up with them. In this way both groups will have their work to do and they can go ahead and finish the territory with their respective equipment without waiting for one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ail publishers should be agreed on the number of hours they expect to work when going out in car groups and set definite times for starting and meeting your group. Time these days is valuable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Names of Interested</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of the reports indicate that brethren are following up petition signers and making no effort to retain the names of those who manifest considerable interest. This is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of those who are called upon and manifest interest should be retained in your file in territory order, and they should be given out with that assignment of territory to the publishers, so that they may be contacted from time to time. This applies not only to petition signers but to all who manifest real Interest. These names, however, should not be held by the individual publisher after that one has made several back calls, but should be turned In to the company and become part of the company’s records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font2"> 4) tage. These can be made locally, and put on your sound cars and automobiles. “Sandwich signs” will be tremendously effective each Saturday afternoon and evening in downtown sections of smaller communities served by stations listed. “RICHES” signs can be changed to advertise “EXPOSED”. Stencils can be made locally, so that every electric flashing sign provided by the Society can be put to use in advertising this broadcast. Make mention of your local station, its call letters, time and subject. They could read something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“EXPOSED” TUNE IN WBBR 6: 30 p.m. SUNDAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of these signs can be worked up very attractively by different individuals in the company. These signs properly used will be very effective throughout the country at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">List of Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that you may advertise locally through the above-suggested means, there are listed separately some of the 150 stations which Brother Rutherford will use by electrical transcription In this nationwide broadcast. Advertise vigorously the stations that best serve your locality. Three copies of this list are enclosed so all the publishers can be informed.</span></p>

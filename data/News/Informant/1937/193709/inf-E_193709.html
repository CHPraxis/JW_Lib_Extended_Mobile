<p><span class="font3">Our brethren in Europe have prepared for the big convention on August 21-23. Brother Rutherford is in Europe now, and will have the privilege of serving at this convention. Brother Rutherford expects to return immediately after that convention, so that he may be here to serve in tlie great witness to be given at Columbus. What a joy it is to all of us to know that this year the Lord is arranging for the greater portion of his people on earth to be assembled in convention, that they may be strengthened to carry on in the war! What blessings are in store for us in America will be revealed beginning September 15. Be there the first day. By the Lord’s grace, Brother Rutherford will open the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every arrangement for the comfort of the brethren is being taken care of by the convention committee. You recall the blessed occasions in times past in conventions assembled, and feel sure that the Columbus convention of September 15-20 will be the best. Are you going?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Placards, automobile signs, bumper signs, handbills and your personal contact with the people will advertise the public meeting. Shortly, now, large signs and placards will appear throughout all the city of Columbus, advertising “SAFETY”, Brother Rutherford’s lecture of the 19th. Many automobiles throughout the country will be driving to Columbus and advertising on the way. Have you ordered your signs? The large sign, 17 inches by 66 inches, is 50c. The bumper signs, 6 Inches by 66 inches, are 25c each. Company servants should order these immediately, so that you can be equipped before you get to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A spacious building at the main entrance of the Fair Grounds will house the book room. There will be no need for you to bring much literature with you except that which you wish to place on the way. A good supply of Bibles, concordances and all of the Society’s publications will be on hand. Samples of the latest model of the sound equipment, phonographs, electric signs, will be on display. These you will want to inspect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Cafeteria</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Extensive arrangements have been made to provide food for the entire convention. These meals will be provided at reasonable rates, and of wholesome food well prepared. We hope all the brethren will use the cafeteria, as this will make it pos-1</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">sible for the Society to provide for all pioneers free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hospital</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some doctors and nurses have responded to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> notice concerning volunteers at the hospital. All doctors who wish to render service in this capacity, aiding in emergency cases of sickness or accident, report at the Red Cross Building on your arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who desire to be immersed should be sure to bring their own bathing suits and towels. Mention of this should be made in all companies by the company servant. Immersion will be early Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Hall</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This beautiful hall is located in the downtown section of Columbus, and there will be public meetings held there every evening. This will be based on the “Exposed” series. To this meeting the public are invited nightly. It will be a great help to many of the brethren throughout the country to attend these meetings, so that when they return home they also can handle them in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Orchestra</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Good response has been had from many of the brethren and Jonadabs who play various instruments. A note to the Convention Committee, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y., stating what instrument you play, your experience, and your desire to join the orchestra, will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Newspaper</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font3"> is the newspaper in Columbus that will carry a full page of convention news daily. Have you subscribed? Company servants should see to it that each one wanting the paper has his subscription in here by September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Parking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When you arrive at the conven-lion, please park in the space assigned for this purpose. Do not park in roadways. Please follow the instructions of the brethren who are directing traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Registration</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pioneers may register beginning with Monday morning. September 13. The pioneers should register on their arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An excellent chain is being arranged for the broadcast of the public lecture on Sunday. Brother Rutherford will speak on “Safety”, and thus far more than 80 stations have been signed up for the broadcast. Radio folders are being consigned throughout the country. Make ar-distribution be-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please arrange for your rooms through the rooming committee. Several of the brethren have made their own arrangements with rooming houses, and this has caused considerable confusion. These rooming houses have canceled their original promises to the rooming committee, and in turn the rooming committee had to notify the people to whom those assignments were made. This has caused extra work. The brethren at Columbus are working hard to give you the best service and accommodations possible. Please cooperate with them. To date accommodations are available for approximately 7,000 persons. They are still getting more rooms, but of those already available 2,000 have been assigned. Write now for your rooming accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thursday, Friday and Monday mornings are devoted to field service. On your arrival at the convention the car driver or one whom you appoint in your car to be the captain should immediately get the assignment of territory. Territory assignments are all issued in one building near the Coliseum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There will be considerable use for sound cars at the convention. There will be territories laid out especially for their use. Those brethren living at long distances need not bring sound cars unless they want to use them for transportation. All companies near by, within approximately 700 miles, should bring theirs for use on assigned locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Trailer Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Space is allotted for the trailer camp. Assignments will be made to the brethren as to where to locate when they bring their trailer or house-car. This camp will be arranged in an orderly manner, so that there will be streets of ample width to get in and out. Please park where assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Divisional servants throughout the country have been working to arrange groups of 25 or more to travel by train or by bus. Brethren traveling by this means should co-operate as much as possible to come to the convention, in order to get the lower rates. Those in the various areas desiring to come to the convention by train or bus should immediately contact the divisional serv-I ant by letter, so that he may know I who are coming and how. Do not</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>After September 12-What?</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>7 Booklets, 25c Contribution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">From September 12 until the beginning of the “King of Kings” testimony period, October 2, this combination of booklets should be pushed aggressively. This will be the final opportunity of the year to catch up in your literature placements, and particularly the total of pieces of literature placed. The booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon, Uncovered,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Protection </span><span class="font3">are of vital importance to the people. These three with four of the other booklets may be placed on a 25c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who eannot attend the Columbus convention should arrange as far as possible to be in the field every day of the convention. Immediately following Brother Rutherford’s public lecture on Sunday all publishers should be organized and go right into the field, taking with them this combination of 7 booklets, and some </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> books, of course. To those who have heard “Safety”, oiler </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and 7 booklets. That does not mean that the brethren should not work Sunday morning before the broadcast. If proper plans are made the brethren can get in a few hours’ work in the morning in some parts of the country, and arrange to listen to Brother Rutherford's lecture in the territory at noon, Eastern Standard Time.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Year’s Field Report Closes September 26</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Mail Your Report Card</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>on Following Monday</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The fiscal year 1937, as far as company, pioneer and auxiliary reports are concerned, will close with your report of Sunday, September 26. The 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th will be carried over until October and be included with your October figures in next year’s report. Therefore, immediately following the 26th the company servant is to mail his report promptly. This also applies to pioneers and auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If this is another case where the company servant or other brethren on the company service committee who look after the service work will not be at home from the convention, they are to make arrangements for this to be taken care of. All brethren who do not figure on being at home by September 26 should mail the report of their convention activity to the company servant so that it will bo in his hands on that date, in order that it may be included in the September report of the company. Each one will kindly arrange to co-operate in this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“King of Kings,” October 2-10 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">First International Period of New Year</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Who Will Be a Publisher?</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Phonograph to Play Big Part in Witness</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's Word gives a description of the &quot;King of kings” and his warfare.—Rev. 10:14-16,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under the leadership of the “King of kings” and his heavenly army Jehovah’s publishers throughout the earth will engage in further warfare of Christianity against Devil religion and racketeering. “Religion is an abomination in Jehovah’s sight and the warfare of testimony must be made against it and in favor of Christianity. It is the time of ‘His strange work’. Leading in this work is Christ Jesus, tlie Faithful and True Witness, who in righteousness makes war. . . . The King of kings and Lord of lords, the Righteous Ruler, has come and he commands Jehovah’s armies. Christ will now magnify and completely vindicate Jehovah's name. Are you on the Lord's side? Then arrange your affairs to participate in this worldwide witness period.” See 1937 Calendar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “King of Kings” testimony period, October 2-10, will be the first international period of the new fiscal year. After the thrilling convention at Columbus all of Jehovah’s people, remnant and Jonadabs, will be full of enthusiasm and zeal to engage in the largest international testimony period on record. It will be a season of great joy to join our brethren all over the earth in forward movement to further expose Jehovah's enemies. Let’s all ‘rise against her in battle’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special for only nine days, October 2-10: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon </span><span class="font3">to be offered together on a 25c contribution. If the people already have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> offer a seven-booklet combination including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font3"> on a , 25c contribution. Feature also ten-cent combinations of three booklets, using one colored-cover booklet and two of the following self-covered booklets: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered. Protection, Armageddon.</span><span class="font3"> Foreign </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and booklets should also be made available to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Approximately ten thousand publishers in this country are now equipped witli phonographs and discs. During this period every one of these machines is to be used in the house-to-house service. Carry disc P-101-102. First introduce the phonograph, present record Riches (102), then offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon, </span><span class="font3">on a 25c contribution. Following Is a suggested phonograph introduction: Greet the householder and introduce yourself as one of Jehovah's witnesses or as a representative of the Watch Tower. Inform the party that the Watch Tower is aiding people of good will to understand the meaning of present-day events in the light of Bible prophecies now being fulfilled. Tell them you have a phonograph with you for this purpose, and a five-minute speech by Judge Rutherford; that you have come to present this message for them free of charge. Offer to set up the machine on the porch, or inside, wherever convenient. After the record is presented, Introduce the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finish your rural territory and small towns during this period, as this is the time of the harvest and I many farmers have funds to contribute for the combination. Sound cars should be kept busy every day sounding out the Kingdom message and preparing the territory for the field publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers and Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this land 36,285 of Jehovah's people, remnant and Jonadabs, assembled to celebrate the memorial of Jehovah’s name. Surely every one of these should be publishing the Kingdom message. During the “Battle Shout” period, last October, only 18,742 shared in this warfare. This shows the possibility of almost doubling the publishers for the “King of Kings” testimony period. All of us. young or old, remnant or Jonadab, should now join as companions and together shoulder the Kingdom responsibilities. All the new ones should be aided to participate, also. Those having physical difficulties or poor health may be able to put in only-one or two hours, while the more</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Your 15 Hours for September</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">As previously announced in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> the divisional assembly scheduled for September 4, 5, and 6 has been canceled. Instead let us make use of this three-day “holiday” period (September 4,5,6) in pushing forward a vigorous campaign in our home territory. Each company should organize field parties for each of the three days, putting in five or more hours each day. All publishers to participate. Company publishers can get in their 15 hours for September before they leave for Columbus. Splendid opportunity for</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Start Now with</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders and Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford’s address “SAFETY”, from the Columbus convention on Sunday, September 19, will undoubtedly be a message of great importance to tlie people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The best way for you to have a share in this lecture is to advertise it. Advertise &quot;SAFETY” at home, and on the way to, and at, the convention. For advertising at home the Society has provided some four million radio folders. These are all to be distributed at home. Do not bring </span><span class="font2">ANY TO THE CONVENTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each company and each individual comprising the company should plan now and see to it that these folders are properly distributed before tlie convention. Those who will be away should see that their share of this work is taken care of properly before they leave. Each one should see to it that his responsibility before the Lord in this respect is properly discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie shipment for all company publishers, pioneers and auxiliaries in company territory will be sent to the company. Pioneers and auxiliaries as well as company publishers are to draw on that stock for distribution. No shipments will be made to pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding advertising en route and at the convention: Reread the notice appearing in the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> regarding advertising signs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">able ones can aid In bearing the burden for the weaker ones by putting in more than the quota of field time. In some cases two publishers can cover one territory, the weaker one working the street floor while the stronger one witnesses to those living in the upstairs apartments. Junior publishers can aid the older brethren in carrying the phonograph. The quota for pioneers is 40 hours, auxiliaries 20 hours, and company publishers 10 hours, for the nine days. Field parties should be arranged for every day of the period. No one is exempted from Kingdom service now at this late date. If all the 36,285 would gather together as one big army under the “King of kings”, Christ Jesus, and engage in the service, we would indeed have tlie largest report of Kingdom activity on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah and Christ Jesus are feeding the great multitude at this time. If we come across people who show exceptional Interest in the Kingdom, we should take their names and addresses and arrange to call back on them in the evening with the “Exposed” series. Continually contacting these people of good will aids in their being fed, and strengthens them to take their stand firmly for the Kingdom.</span></p>

Let us all try to make September a big month of Kingdom activity, get in our time at home early in the month, and then leave in a joyful frame of mind for the best convention yet, the Columbus convention of September 15-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These signs are now available and should be obtained by all those who contemplate doing any advertising en route.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>School Information Wanted</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">In connection with compulsory flag-salute cases we need to know I he number of children of Jehovah's witnesses and Jonadabs of school age throughout the country. This means children from 7 to 16 years of age. Will each company servant send the Information for his area on a post card as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Number of school children for (insert town and state) is (insert number).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who have already given this information need not repeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not wait until school begins. We need tlie information NOW.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Whenever something goes wrong with your phonograph, portable transcription machine or sound car that you cannot repair yourself, then write to tlie Society concerning the trouble. I’lease give the serial number of the equipment; otherwise we shall be unable to assist you. The serial number is absolutely essential. so that we can determine the model. Will you please do this in the future, when writing about repairs? Please tell us what you believe is wrong. Several of the brethren have written in, “My machine doesn’t work. What shall I do?” Please be specific.</span></p>

It will be necessary for the average company to plan in advance for the taking of this stock. It may be in the far western points that the company servant or stockkeeper will be away. In that event competent brethren should be appointed to look after this, and such preliminary preparations as can be made should be made in advance, so that when the time comes it may be accomplished with the least possible confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is very important that this information be in this office during the first week of October, if at all possible. We are asking each company, pioneer and auxiliary to cooperate fully.</span></p>

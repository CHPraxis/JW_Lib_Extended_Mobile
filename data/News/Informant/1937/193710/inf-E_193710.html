<p><span class="font1">The unity manifested at the Columbus convention was marvelous. Brother Rutherford opened the convention Wednesday afternoon and his discourse was interrupted frequently by hearty applause, which indicated appreciation and understanding of his pointed remarks concerning harmony in the companies and the doing away with all disturbers. It was a thriller. And then he introduced the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study </span><span class="font1">booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font1"> has given you most of the details. You will want to read it carefully. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> will give you a summary of the convention, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> wants to say just a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All those who attended the convention went home with their guns loaded and they are better equipped to move into action now. October should find in the field the greatest number of publishers ever engaged in the field service at one time. The brethren left that convention ready to fight, not one another, but for God’s kingdom. They went away from that convention equipped with new instruments of war, the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font1"> the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Safety,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study,</span><span class="font1"> and the first issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font1"> They saw at the convention the new sound equipment No. 4, for which many orders were placed. Through all the sessions of the convention practical information was given concerning the use of phonographs, phonograph back calls, the use of sound cars, how study meetings and service meetings should be conducted, and every evening during the convention a meeting, using the “Exposed” series, was held at Memorial Hall which was instructive to all attending. This convention was just one big training school, everyone there eager to get the mind of Christ, our “King of kings”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Rutherford very clearly pointed out the line of battle in his many talks to the brethren. His Saturday’s speech on Jeremiah thrilled not only the 20,000 in session at Columbus, but also thousands assembled in meeting halls in England and Australia. Immediately after this marvelous meeting where the Lord through Brother Rutherford revealed to us new truths, hundreds of cablegrams came from many parts of the earth, not only from the brethren assembled at these halls connected by private wire with the Coliseum, but also from brethren in little companies all over Europe and other parts of the earth who picked up the lecture on shortwave radio sets. This truly is the Lord’s doing and is marvelous in our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again on Sunday Brother Rutherford addressed the convention and thousands more by radio, delivering his lecture “Safety”. What a day! What a crowd! What a witness! All this was arranged of the Lord and was further witness to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On two occasions Brother Rutherford addressed the pioneers only, who are dally in the front ranks. This was greatly appreciated by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On Monday Brother Rutherford closed the convention with a question and answer meeting, and upward of 10,000 people were still there, eager to get the last words of instruction. Immediately after this very edifying meeting the brethren started for home to take with them the good news, the spirit of the convention and the joy of the Lord, their hearts burning with zeal as never before to carry out in the front line of battle the commission the Lord had given them. This convention closed the year, but its effect will be a strong blow against the Devil’s organization during our next twelve months of activity. Never was there a convention of the Lord’s people on earth to equal this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Worshiping God”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The thrills did not end with the convention, nor the detailed instructions. On Sunday September 26, when Brother Rutherford spoke on “Worshiping God” over a nationwide network he revealed the importance and scope of a tremendous work which the Lord’s people have willingly undertaken to do. This lecture seemed to be the closing remarks of the convention, and, with most of the brethren back home in their regular territories, it was the clear command for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> would like to say much more about the convention, but space does not permit. This convention of Jehovah’s witnesses exceeded by far all expectations. The companions, Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs, left the convention with joy filled to overflowing, anxious to follow out the instructions they received, having clearly in mind the battle that is before them.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Convention “Lost and Found”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">There were a number of miscellaneous articles left in the “Lost and Found” department at the Columbus convention. Anyone missing any articles at the convention will please write, and if we have them we shall forward them to you.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>After October 10—What?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">After the “King of Kings” testimony period, which ends on October 10, continue to push the campaign with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon, </span><span class="font1">or seven booklets, on a 25c contribution. Let’s try to make it 30,000 publishers for October, the first month of our new year.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A New Magazine</span></h4>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>A New Name, a New Dress, a New Size</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">During his discourse to the brethren at the convention on Saturday Brother Rutherford made this announcement :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Eighteen years ago, in the state of Ohio, at the Cedar Point convention, this month, there was launched the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> magazine. That magazine has constantly and earnestly, by the grace of the Lord, endeavored to put forth the message that would comfort the people. The last issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> has appeared. You will not see another one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At that moment there was a groan throughout the entire grounds, which was one of great surprise and deep regret. No greater compliment could have been given a magazine than this expression of disappointment on the part of the brethren. But within a few seconds that expression of disappointment was changed to one of great joy. Brother Rutherford continued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Wait a minute! All over the earth the people are in distress. They need comfort and consolation, and there will appear tomorrow morning upon the grounds of this convention a magazine in a better dress, called Consolation I [Great applause from the audience] ‘The Golden Age’ is not a Scriptural name, but ‘Consolation’ is. By God’s grace Jehovah’s witnesses and his servants are messengers of consolation, and we hope that every instrument will be used to carry consolation to the hungry souls of this earth.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Safety”—the Speech—the Booklet</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Before a packed-out Coliseum, in fact, before a packed-out Fair Grounds, Brother Rutherford delivered that thrilling lecture “Safety”. Just imagine, 30,000 persons in the Coliseum, in the Grandstand, in orderly arranged rows of benches outdoors, thousands sitting in their ears and others sitting on the lawns throughout the entire grounds, listening with rapt attention, no one moving around, just keeping their ears tuned to the loud - speakers! What a meeting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, if you were not at the convention you heard the mighty</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Autographed Edition</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">On Saturday, during a most thrilling discourse on Jeremiah’s prophecy, Brother Rutherford announced to 20,000 brethren, in attendance at the convention, the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font1"> He displayed one from the platform. The cheers and applause expressed to the fullest the brethren’s appreciation of this new publication. Real joy was manifested by all who were able to obtain a copy. Within two hours after its release all of the 10,000 copies of the autographed edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> taken to the convention were gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You can, however, still get your copy of the autographed edition, which contains a personal letter written by Brother Rutherford. This letter is so pointed and sets out </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font1">clearly our commission. A contribution of 50c sent in immediately by individuals or through the company servant will bring this personal copy to you very shortly. Use the order blank enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And did </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> go on Sunday morning? Twenty thousand copies were taken to the convention. Pioneers were privileged to distribute these. Every one of them was taken by the brethren. A good many of the public coming to the noon meeting on Sunday also obtained copies of the first issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All subscribers who have been receiving </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> will now receive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font1"> It is a better magazine. The point is, How many new subscribers will </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font1">have within the next few months? Every home of the anointed and Jonadabs should receive </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font1">All people of good will should be given sample copies, so that they too may subscribe. It is expected that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> subscription list will increase rapidly. For sample copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> No. 472, use enclosed order blank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">shout of ayes and the applause, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font1">only those who were on the grounds could appreciate this great meeting arranged by the Lord through his organization. There was delivered the message of the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To show their appreciation, these people took away with them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">22,000 </span><span class="font1">booklets immediately after the lecture and made generous contributions for the publication of more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font1"> is now being printed by the millions, and you should order your supply now and get </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font1"> into the hands of the people. Use the order blank enclosed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Worshiping God” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Plays Big Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The majority of the brethren throughout the country beard Brother Rutherford’s lecture &quot;Worshiping God”, on September 26, clearly showing that the general radio work is finished and henceforth the brunt of the fight depends upon sound equipment. The chief work from this time forth, therefore, is pushing the Kingdom service work by means of sound, particularly the phonograph, and using this means to place the literature with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The time has come when the phonograph should be a part of every publisher’s equipment. The phonograph is a provision by the Lord for our use, the ignoring or neglect of which, for those who are able to use and can obtain one, is despising the Lord’s provision. All should study Brother Rutherford's speech on &quot;Worshiping God”, which will appear in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> No. 472, that they may get a proper understanding of this great issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Pioneer or Auxiliary Service</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Pioneers 110 Hours, Auxiliaries 50 Hours per Month</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">At Columbus Brother Rutherford informed the convention of a group of pioneers to be chosen for special service. He referred to this group as a “Hying squadron”, but he has instructed this office to ignore that name and henceforth the ones specially sent to the field will be designated “special pioneers”. This special service is now in process of organization, and all brethren concerned will be properly notified during the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the convention Brother Rutherford further brought to our attention the great need of putting in more time in the field service. In fact, the entire convention was full of inspiration for everyone to get busy and give the Lord’s service the primary consideration. Seventy brethren enrolled for the pioneer and auxiliary service during the convention. However, in view of the increased service with the phonograph, back calls, and aiding new interest, the field now demands more full-time publishers than ever before. There is sufficient isolated territory available to keep several hundred new pioneers busy day and night. Also many companies are writing In requesting pioneer assistance. At present the combined pioneer and auxiliary enrollment is 2,818, yet the field could sustain as many as 5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pioneer service is open for all those able to give their full time and arrange to serve an average minimum of 110 hours a month. Those in position to secure equipment such as a car, house-car or trailer may serve in the isolated territory or sections of the country where there are no companies organized at present. However, if you are able to meet the time requirement but do not have any equipment, this would not preclude you from joining the pioneer army, because assignments can be made for you to serve in your own locality or with the local company. If you can meet pioneer requirements either in isolated or in company territory, write the Brooklyn office now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are many brethren who are not yet able to be entirely free of secular and household obligations but could very easily arrange their affairs to meet the auxiliary requirement of 50 hours each month. This means putting in five hours a day for only ten days a month. Since</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">j There were a large number of phonograph orders received at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Columbus convention, on which factory is now working hard to them placed in the hands of brethren as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">30,000 Publishers Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The One whom Jehovah employs to execute his judgment is the Executioner or Vindicator acting by authority of Jehovah. The keynote of the Columbus convention was to rise up against Jehovah’s enemies in battle under the leadership of Christ Jesus, the great Vindicator. “The part that God’s people perform in the war is to proclaim his judgment of vengeance soon to be executed, and also to inform the people of the only means of escape and safety, and thereby comfort those that mourn. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">If you are devoted to Jehovah and his Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">will do your part. </span><span class="font1">Armed in the holy cause of righteousness, equipped with the sword of the spirit, and instructed in the proper use thereof, and filled with wisdom and spiritual understanding, GO FORTH TO THE WAR, fully confident of victory through Christ Jesus our Lord and Jehovah’s Vindicator.” (From J. F. Rutherford letter in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine Days of Intense Warfare</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">December 4-12 has been set aside for nine days of intense warfare all over the earth. Begin now to make preparations for every detail, to be properly equipped for action. The new publications </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Safety </span><span class="font1">in which the committee can aid them and co-operate with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See that a quota of hours is set, this to be based on 15 hours per publisher for the average number of publishers you had out during the year 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Arrange for proper studies-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> studies, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> studies. These should be conducted as outlined at the Columbus convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chairmen should be appointed for all studies and thoroughly instructed on how they may co-operate with the service committee and company servant in helping brethren who attend the studies to have a part in the field service also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Service meetings should be arranged for. Competent brethren should be chosen to conduct these meetings. Young brethren who have a vision of the Kingdom and the spirit of the Lord should be used in these various services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sound work should be carefully planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Check condition of all equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sound cars should be scheduled and planned for month by month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Encourage having a phonograph for every publisher who can handle one, if possible. If that is not possible, see that the ones you have are rotated so that the widest possible witness is made by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have all records and the speed of the various machines checked, and see that they are reproducing properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See if the territory is being systematically covered with the “Exposed” series. If not, arrange to have this done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See that the company territory is properly zoned so that reasonable assignments may be made to the publishers and the territory may be properly worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See that the arrangement is built up so that no territory is held over three months by any publisher without finishing it or turning it in for reassignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See that proper arrangements are made for calling back on the people of good will who manifest interest; and see that a proper record of same is kept and these people are called on periodically and invited to any</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">companies and other brethren who require phonographs should get their orders in now. First come, first served. There were also a large number of sound equipment No. 4 (SEA) orders taken at the Columbus convention and which we are filling as fast as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this day of battle the Lord has provided wonderful equipment for His people. Surely “this is the day the Lord hath made”. “Rise up against her in battle” with the equipment that He has provided. Let the anointed everywhere accept this great privilege of replacing the radio work with actual house-to-house visitation by the Lord’s people, carrying the message in its recorded form for the people to hear and discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the counting of back-call time and phonograph time is now proper, and as the evenings are a very desirable time to call on the people, the auxiliary service is within the reach of most brethren. Auxiliaries generally serve with the local company in its territory assignment and are a great aid in a stable and aggressive company organization. The auxiliary branch of the service could be doubled in number. Write the Society for further information on the auxiliary service, and a questionnaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pioneer and the auxiliary service is open to all of Jehovah’s consecrated people, whether they are of the remnant or are Jonadabs. The next few months should witness a great increase in these two branches of the service. If you are not a pioneer or an auxiliary publisher, be a good company publisher. We should have 30,000 publishers in the United States reporting every month.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>There Is a Lot to Do</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">The company servant and service committee should be ‘ensamples to the believers’ in faith and diligence. They should take the lead in actual house-to-house witnessing with the aid of the phonograph and records. They should also give diligent care to looking after the Kingdom interests the Lord has placed In their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Starting the fiscal year 1938 they should check and see:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That all company records are properly transferred to the new committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That proper and competent brethren are assigned to the various positions in the committee, and approved by the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That a proper inventory of the stock was taken and sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That such reordering is done as is necessary in order to balance the stock. Use the order blank enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That proper plans are made for the work of the fiscal year 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That a quota of publishers is established. We should have 30,000 publishers in the field each month. If the company servant and service committee properly plan and aid the brethren everywhere into the service this can be done easily. Find out in a tactful and Christian way what is hindering many of the brethren from going out in the field regularly. It may be that it is lack of transportation or some other such thing</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">On the opening day of the convention Brother Rutherford introduced a new booklet published by the Society entitled “Model Study”. This booklet will be a great aid to every one of the Lord’s people in carrying on “Exposed” meetings and those on “Religion and Christianity”. The series of “Exposed” meetings at the Memorial Hall during the convention were of great help to all the brethren and were greatly appreciated by the public too. The importance of the “Exposed” meetings and the use of the records carrying Brother Rutherford's lectures were emphasized at the convention. The brethren will now use them more than ever before, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font1"> booklet is going to be a great aid. Get your copy. Carry it with you in the service, and especially use it in your back-call work. It can be had on a contribution of 5c. Orders should be placed through the company servant. Use the order blank.</span></p>

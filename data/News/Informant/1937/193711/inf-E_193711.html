<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Arrange for Back Calls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The new disc P-113, P-114 is beyond question the most thrilling and stirring recording yet produced for field service. Wait until you hear it and see the enthusiasm it arouses for the Kingdom. You will never tire of hearing it a thousand times as you run it for your family, friends, neighbors, and all the people you meet in the house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Description in words of this recording can hardly do justice to it. P-113 opens with the actual reproduction of the Sunday session of the convention at Columbus before an audience of 30,000 people. The “Safety” talk has just finished; then Brother Rutherford presents the Resolution saying, “This company of Christian people assembled at Columbus, Ohio, declare that we are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ.” You clearly hear Brother Rutherford’s voice echo powerfully through that great assembly hall as he gives word after word of the Resolution. Then he closes, bidding all those in favor of this resolution to rise and say Aye. A mighty shout of “Aye” responds, followed by a roar of hand-clapping for several seconds. Thus the climax of the greatest of conventions is reproduced and is now to be passed on to all the people of good will to the ends of the earth. A brief radio announcement follows, and the recording closes with tire quartet song, “On the Rock of Ages Founded.” The whole scene is just as it was at Columbus and broadcast over the nation-wide radio chain. It takes one right back to the convention, recalling the many thrills and loving provisions Jehovah had in store for his people there. Let us take this bit of the convention to every person of good will in the earth, that they also may shout “Aye” to this resolution and declare themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Enemies” Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">P-114 presents the brief talk on “Enemies”. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consola tion</span><span class="font2"> of October 20 carries the actual text of this speech. Brother Rutherford begins the recording, “The publishers now exhibit to the people the book entitled ‘Enemies’.” He further gives the purpose of this publication, what it contains, and reveals the necessity of getting this information now. A further quotation: “The publishers are not selling the book, but they do receive a small contribution for each book, which will be used for printing more books to aid the people. Persons who are too poor to contribute will receive the book free upon condition that they study it carefully.” This whole recording is an excellent presentation for the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font2">to the people and should prove a very effective instrument in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both recordings P-113 and P-114 are on the same disc, and may be had for 70e, or six discs for $3.50. If your company has not ordered its </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Time for Action</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Let our battle cry ring out: ‘Arise against her in battle’ I The recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font2"> have called our attention to the fact that Jehovah through his servant Jeremiah announced God’s ultimatum to the people of Jerusalem. He gave the people of Jerusalem time to amend their ways and respond to his ultimatum. He tolerated the unfaithful nation for a long while, but the time came for a showdown. That was a prophetic picture of “Christendom”, the unfaithful crowd that claims to be God’s people, and it is to “Christendom” that Jehovah’s witnesses now deliver the ultimatum of Jehovah God. The Lord’s servants do not add or delete any part of God’s message, but state it as it is given to them. It is Jehovah’s ultimatum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now comes the time for a worldwide witness with Jehovah’s message set out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety.</span><span class="font2"> Since the Columbus convention the factory has been working full speed ahead and some extra shifts in order to be sure that everybody throughout the world will be amply supplied with the English edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety.</span><span class="font2"> Hundreds of thousands of copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and millions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font2"> booklets are ready now for the “Vindicator” period. They are ready for you to take into action. Is y our local organization prepared, and do you have your supply? Are you ready for action?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the first time that a worldwide distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> is arranged. Every one of the witnesses of God will want a part in this “Vindicator” testimony period. The Lord through His organization has provided his people with new instruments of w’ar to carry on in the battle. First we have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font2"> the new book, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety,</span><span class="font2"> the new booklet. These two publications will be offered on a contribution of only 25c. After this period, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> will be offered on a contribution of 25e, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font2"> booklet on a contribution of 5c. Then the record P-113, P-114 (“Enemies”) sets out an excellent introduction and reasons why people should have the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> Use this record extensively during “Vindicator” period. After you have run the “Enemies” record, then run P-113, the last part of the lecture “Safety”, which contains the resolution presented by Brother Rutherford at the conclusion of his speech on September 19. This resolution will unquestionably create a desire on the part of many of those hearing it to have you make a back call. After the first back call with the “Safety” records, then follow up with “Worshiping</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God”, the “Exposed” series, and “Religion and Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren speaking foreign languages are also well equipped. In almost every language the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Itiches</span><span class="font2"> and a recent self-covered booklet are available, and then there are the new records in Arabic, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. Each publisher should know what his territory is going to be, and be prepared to serve these people with whatever language they speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this time we do not know whether or not 30,000 publishers were in the field in October or how many will be in the field in November, but there is no reason why the quota for December should not be 30,000 publishers. If each one does his part and gets out even once during this period we shall reach that quota. Even if it is for only an hour, get out in this “Vindicator” period and place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> with the people. Company organizations should see that every one of the publishers who has ever been in the field is given the opportunity to get out into the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If each one of these publishers, on the average, places only 5 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> during this nine-day period, that will mean 150,000 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> distributed in this country alone. You can’t afford to miss this initial campaign with the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> Then there is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font2"> booklet. Everyone should be able to dispose of at least 10 copies. The majority of the brethren will place many more than that. Why not push this booklet during the week and place over 300,000 copies? Then there is the matter of hours to have in mind. The pioneers will strive to put in 40 hours for this “Vindicator” period, auxiliaries 20 hours, and company publishers at least 10 hours. However, if you are not able to put in the 10 hours, don’t let that stop you from being a publisher. The one thing every company organization should do during “Vindicator” period is to try to get all those associated with the company into the field with the message </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies. </span><span class="font2">Shall we have 30,000 publishers for the “Vindicator” testimony period? The answer to this question rests with every one who has ever been a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The service committee should see that the names of all interested persons are given to the publishers, so that they may make back calls during the “Vindicator” period and place with these people the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety.</span><span class="font2"> Give them an opportunity to hear the new recordings. This back-call work can be done in addition to the regular door-to-door witnessing, and should be carried on particularly in the evenings. This will help increase your hours. Every service committee should have a meeting shortly to consider ways and means to make the “Vindicator” testimony period the best period they have ever arranged for in their territory. The company should eagerly co-operate in all the details the service committee brings forth as outlined in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From now until December 4 talk “Vindicator” period, talk publishers, talk </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Safety,</span><span class="font2"> records, and territory, and be ready to move without delay on December 4.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Five Hours of Field Service November 25</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">November 25 is a nation-wide holiday called “Thanksgiving Day”. Almost all the people are at home on this day, which makes it a very good day for witnessing. The people are generally in a good frame of mind and receptive to the Kingdom message. Every company should organize field parties for this day and arrange to go out for five hours of Kingdom service. Can we have 3(1,0(10 field publishers out in the field on “Thanksgiving Day” and give the people something really to be thankful for—tlie prospect of living in God’s righteous kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Greatly Appreciated</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">These two magazines are a great aid to all of the anointed and persons of good will. Tn calling on people of good will, inquiry should always be made as to whether they are subscribers for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> If they are not, point out to them the importance of being on the regular mailing list. The prophecies unfolded through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> are of the greatest aid to a Christian, and are essentia] Io those who stay in the fight.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Cities of 50,000 and Over</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All companies having cities of 50,000 or more in their territory have been requested to prepare a map of each city, subdivided Into territories as they have them at the present time, and forward them immediately to The Watch Tower, 117 Adams St.. Brooklyn. N.Y They are needed for the “special pioneer” service that the Society is now ready to inaugurate.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Back-Call Slips and Reports</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Making back calls on persons who show definite interest In the Kingdom message is one of the important features of the work now to be carried on. In order to have this thoroughly organized the Society is printing a standard form of back-call slip. Each publisher should carry two or three of these slips with him in the field. When an interested party is found, the publisher will fill in one of these slips. Publishers should make their own back calls whenever possible. If a publisher is unable to make the back call himself, then he will fill in all the information called for and turn the slip over to the company for file. If the publisher makes his own back calls, then he will hold the slips until he is through, and then turn the slips over to the company for file. If in succeeding back calls you find the party Is absolutely disinterested, then the Back Call slip should be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company should so arrange its files of Back Call slips that they can be handed out every time the territory is assigned, so that these persons can be given special attention. These slips can be had at 40c per thousand. Pioneers may have them free. Sample is sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Reporting Back Calls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">At the bottom of your report card, all companies, auxiliaries and pioneers should report the number of back calls actually made during the month. Brethren making back calls should make out a Publisher’s Field Service Report for each back call, and turn these In, and the company servants should keep a record of the total number of back calls made. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> will carry a regular report on the total number of back calls made, so that we can see the progress of this work from month to month. A back call will be considered a special visit made on an interested party, with the phonograph, and reported as such. When persons begin to attend studies, back calls will no longer be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1 column</span><span class="font2"> I) supply as yet, it would better do so at once, using the special order blank. These discs are now ready for shipment, and every phonograph In the land should be equipped with such a disc as soon as possible. These discs may be used In the field service as soon as you receive them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is suggested that these new discs be used in the following manner: In your house-to-house phonograph service, run the lecture on “Enemies” (P-114) first, and place the book with the party. Then present the special treat P-113. After this has been run, tell them they should hear the entire talk by Judge Rutherford on “Safety” and that you will be pleased to call again at some convenient time and let them hear this thrilling speech. P-113 should induce more back calls with the series than any method previously at our disposal. This recording can also be used to arrange the other series on back call, such as “Worshiping God”, “Exposed,” and “Religion and Christianity”. The method introduced in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> booklet should also be applied to these new series of “Safety” and “Worshiping God” when serving the people on back calls. P-113 arouses Kingdom enthusiasm and whets their appetites for more of this life-giving food. By the Lord’s grace, let us give this good news to the people of good will for their protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This new disc, P-113, P-114, may also be used for the sound-car programs. Announcements are being prepared for this new disc and will be sent to the sound-car operators shortly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You a Regular Publisher?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Are You Going to Be One of the 30,000?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Scriptures tell of a great voice of a great multitude giving praise to Jehovah, the Most High. (Rev. 19) That day of Jehovah’s praise is here, and the “strange work” must now be done. During the past year there were more than 30,000 individual publishers associated in the field service in this country; yet for the year we averaged only 21,689 each month, or an increase of only 96 over the previous year. The largest number of brethren ever in the field during one month was 27,004. Why cannot we all get together every month as companions, both the remnant and all the Jonadabs, and be regular publishers unitedly lifting our voices of praise to the Most High </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font2"> This is the least we can do to show our appreciation for the great loving-kindness and abundant provisions of our heavenly Father. We should have an average of 30,000 brethren in the field each month as</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Company Territory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">There are many companies writing in to this office for pioneer assistance to aid them in effectively covering their territory and also to help them build up their good-will Interest. As soon as possible, pioneers will be sent to these various companies to aid them. However, this does not mean that the company should expect to shoulder its local responsibilities upon pioneers and thus take it easy themselves. The primary responsibility for local territory rests with the company publishers, and they should serve their areas and build up the Interest therein to the best of their ability. If there are other companies desiring to have pioneers assist them for a period of time each year, let this office know at once. Pioneers desiring to work in company territories during the winter should write to this office for a list of these companies requesting assistance; and after a choice is made, let us know, so that we can give you a definite assignment to work with the company. Since the convention brethren everywhere are realizing the necessity for keener company organization and the need for more efficient field service to aid the people of good will. The field is now ripe for a large Increase. More full-time publishers are required to meet the territory demands. If you are Interested in the pioneer or auxiliary service, write the Brooklyn office for complete Information.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Service Items</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Every month the Society receives hundreds of letters from people who have heard about the Kingdom and request further Information. Some write and ask that one of Jehovah’s witnesses visit them ; others want to know how they can become a witness for Jehovah; and many wish to have one of Jehovah’s people call on their friend in another city who is interested. Many times letters come requesting to be put in touch with the local brethren to care for their funerals. A large number write in for literature, and the radio broadcasts bring in many responses. All these names, addresses, and information are gathered together and passed on to the various companies and pioneers throughout the land for back-calling. This month there are being mailed to the brethren over 3.000 of these good-will contacts. When you receive these notices arrange to have competent brethren visit these people with the phonograph and the latest literature. One our share in this ‘great voice of a great multitude’ praising the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One cannot pass his Kingdom responsibilities on to another or blame someone else for one’s not having gone into the service. Each one must bear his own share, Jonadabs as well as those of the remnant. Therefore be not idle or wait to be asked to go into the service, but take the initiative and carry on the service in harmony with the organization instructions given. We are now on test before the Lord as to our Integrity, faithfulness, and diligence in caring for the Kingdom interests placed in our hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font2">us all put our hand to the plow and move steadily forward. Below are the numbers of publishers in the field last October, November, and December. Can we not average 30,000 publishers for each of these three months this year? Are you going to do your share?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>New Records in Arabic, Italian, Polish, and Spanish</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The series of records on “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” are now ready in Arabic, Italian, and Spanish, and we expect to have them in Polish within a few weeks. The cost of these is the same as of the English records; namely, the entire set of 18 discs for $10.50. If in your territory there are people speaking one of these languages you should get one or more of these sets. As a rule, people speaking a foreign language are attentive listeners to the Kingdom message in their own tongue, and special effort should be made to reach these people. The numbers and symbols for these records are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">PA-61-A to PA-96-R (18 discs), “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” in Arabic;</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">sister writes: “Enclosed find a subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> for Mrs. P. Mrs. P. is very much interested. This was a radio back call. She had nearly all the books, and gave me an order for six books she did not have, also for an Italian Bible. I played the phonograph, and she enjoyed the records so much she called her neighbor up to hear them, too. I am sure Mrs. P. is a person of good will: she told me she always prays for Brother Rutherford and asks the dear Lord to continue to use him.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>|Novembers Field Activities</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Booklets to Be Featured</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">As was suggested by Brother Rutherford at the convention, brethren should spend five hours a day when they are in the field. Much time is lost in going back and forth if for only an hour or two in the field. Now with the phonograph service it is very easy to spend five hours in the field and not feel very tired at the close of the service. Therefore, for the month of November all the companies should arrange for field parties on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, spending five hours of service each time the party goes out. Seven booklets, consisting of three self-covered and four colored-cover booklets, should be offered in combination on a 25c contribution. Of course, always carry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> with you; and when you have the opportunity, place these with the people. If you have your new disc “Enemies”, use it and present </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font2"> booklet to the people. Use your phonographs in the house-to-house service, running the recording &quot;Value of Knowledge”, which presents the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection </span><span class="font2">booklets. After this recording is presented, offer the seven booklets.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>New Signs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Now is the time to prepare for fall activity. Do not wait until after doing your fall work, but prepare NOW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the equipment that can be used extensively during this fall and winter are the electric signs with their new and very attractive advertisements in sets of four. We have received hundreds of orders for these to date, but these signs should be sprinkled throughout the country by the thousands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Correspondence has come to hand that some brethren carry into the field literature that is far from presentable; it is dirty and dog-eared. People do not wish to accept such literature, and it creates the impression in the mind of the average person that the message such literature would contain would only be on a par with the appearance of the book or booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom message is a most sacred and precious treasure entrusted to Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions by Jehovah to be taken to the people. It should be handled with proper consideration and respect, and literature that is not presentable should never be returned to stock or accepted by the stockkeeper. Brethren who take out literature and permit It to become soiled should contribute for it rather than try to return it to stock or exchange it for other literature.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Records</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Some months ago an order blank was sent out to all companies so that they might obtain the records P-61-A to P-96-R. Due to manufacturing a large number of these at one time, we were able to reduce the cost to the brethren. This supply of records is now exhausted, and ordering in small quantities to fill present requirements means a higher cost. Therefore it Is necessary to ask the same amount for these records as for other discs, namely, $10.50 for the entire set of 18 discs. This change is effective June 1, 1937. If the brethren require replacements because of broken or worn-out records, these can be had at 70c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Spanish records are now in stock carrying the •‘Exposed” series and “Religion and Christianity”. These should be used extensively in Spanish-speaking territory. The set of 18 discs PS-61-A to PS-96-R can be had at $10.50. In the Spanish we also have the records PS-97-A to PS-102. Many of the brethren will want to use particularly PS-101,102 in their Spanish-speaking territory while witnessing, as this introduces </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font2">and the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font2"> These records PS-97-A to PS-102 can be had at 70c a disc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Italian records also are now on hand. We have a supply of the following three discs: PI-1, 2 Jehovah, Rebellion ; PI-7. 8 Soul, The Dead ; PI-9, 10 Purgatory, Resurrection. These, too, have proved very helpful in the witness work. They are 70c a disc, or six discs to one address, $3.50.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Testimony Booklet</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">A new booklet 1ms been printed by the Society containing a testimony for the books and booklets in 31 different languages, each page devoted to a language setting out the various publications in that language. It is bound in a heavy cover, so that it will last long. It also contains a full colored illustration of all the bound books and booklets. These testimony booklets can be had at 2c each; this to cover the cost of printing. Companies desiring these booklets should order them through the company servant. These testimony booklets are especially helpful in territory where many languages are spoken. The publishers should always carry one with them. At your next service meeting find out from the publishers how many want a copy of this testimony booklet. Order them with your next shipment of literature. A remittance should accompany this order.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Company studies in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should be arranged at the most convenient time for the members of the company. Suggestions heretofore made have been mere suggestions, and not commandments, of course. Some find it more convenient to have the meeting on Sunday afternoon; others, in the evening ; but some companies, at other times. Let each company arrange for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study as will best serve the Kingdom interests.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>You Will Need Literature, Phonographs, Territory, Time</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Nine days, June 5-13, are designated “Glittering Sword” testimony period, a time for special effort on the part of all the Lord’s people in pressing the fight for the honor of Jehovah’s word and name, the present warfare. Feeding the honest-hearted with the truth of the Bible, and exposing the enemies of Jehovah with the message of truth, that is our work; and should not this most favorable season in June accomplish another tremendous witness? It is an occasion in which everyone who is on the Lord’s side can have an active personal part. How many of the nine days can you devote to the field service during this period? Set your personal quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the details of this campaign have been set out in the May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> which you are to have studied carefully, proceeding in accordance therewith. The schedule of service meetings for May provided a thorough study of that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">at your service meetings. In addition to the arrangements of the companies as units, it is now up to each individual to make such personal</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After June 13, What?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Work Rurals</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Exposed” Series</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Lots of Work to Do</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">As a presentation, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> or six booklets on a 25c contribution, supplemented with other books and booklets for the interested. The rurals need </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered, Protection, Armageddon;</span><span class="font2"> in fact they need every thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year’s working of the rurals will require considerably more systematic planning than heretofore, because of the phonograph work. There were many petition signers in the outlying sections of the territory. If these have not already been contacted the territory should be so distributed as to reach them Immediately, commencing, of course, with the section in which there are the most names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Exposed” campaign is to be carried on in conjunction with this work, and your arrangements must be such as to provide for them. The series should be put on in every town and village in your territory, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday. Ascertain at which time you are plans as to enable the publishers to give the utmost co-operation in the campaign and put the greatest amount of time possible in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Time is the thing, and it can be realized by taking the greatest advantage of the season of the year. All-day witnessing groups should be organized for every one of the nine days possible, and this will enable outlying territory to be reached to advantage. This will take planning, and wise distribution of the publishers in towns and rurals so that the automobiles in the rurals will not be overloaded for rural work, and so that the “Exposed” meetings can be properly advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> you will receive the testimony card prepared to aid in presenting the special combination of literature for this period. The combination is placed on a contribution of 50c, and consists of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Preservation., Protection, Uncovered, Armageddon,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, </span><span class="font2">with such substitutions as are necessary as previously suggested, and the combination at this special offer is limited to the nine days only. Have your stock on hand and in the hands of the publishers. The company publishers are to obtain the literature from the company stock at the regular company rates. A refund of 64c can be made to the likely to get the best audience. Arrange for a hall if one is available, as that method seems to be the best way of putting on the series. If no halls are available or if you believe you can get a better audience out of doors by putting on the series over the sound car or PTM, utilizing parks, courthouse squares or other places where the people are accustomed to assemble, make arrangements accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Work the territory in advance, as outlined in Brother Rutherford’s letter, using phonographs and announcements during the previous week in the town and adjacent rurals, concentrating your activity particularly on Saturday afternoon and evening and on Sunday, by giving as wide a witness as possible at that time. Advertise the meeting over the sound car and PTM Saturday afternoon and night, when the people are assembled in town. Then put on your first section of the series. The following week-end do the same, advertising with the sound equipment and announcements, extending your activity further into the rurals, presenting the literature and handcompany publishers for each complete combination they place, this refund to be made at the time they turn in their daily reports. Then on the report cards for the month of June the company servants and the auxiliaries are to note the number of complete combinations of two bound books and four booklets placed on the contribution of fifty cents during the period, and a credit will be given on the book accounts at this office. This credit will be Glc and 8c respectively for companies and auxiliaries for each combination thus reported. Unless this report is made, no credit will be granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Glittering Sword” testimony period follows one week after the Divisional campaigns held on May 29 and 30. The Divisional campaigns themselves should be an Impetus to the testimony period, and advantage should be taken of them to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is an important time in which we are privileged to serve, and this is further emphasized in the opposition of the Devil and his crowd to the work now well under way, the “Exposed” campaign. He does not want himself and his organization to be uncovered. Hence the warfare, and in this the victorious one is and will be Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s “Glittering Sword&quot;, under whose command we are privileged to serve. Surely this testimony period itself deserves our full support and participation, and will receive this of the faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ing out Invitations to the meeting. Then the second section of the series should be put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the first two week-ends a six-booklet combination may be featured. The third week-end, cover as much as possible of this entire territory with sound and invitations and offer the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> book on a 25c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your future activity will have to be determined by the interest manifested. If the interest justifies it, continue with “Religion and Christianity” series, leaving enough publishers in the territory to carry on these meetings and to make necessary back calls on the interested and generally develop the interest in that area while the majority of the workers go on and put on a similar campaign in some other area. Large companies can so divide their forces and equipment that they may have two or more of such series going on simultaneously. Publishers without phonographs should also participate in this work, using the invitations to the meetings and offering the literature to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Invitation Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are to be used extensively in the territory, offering them to the people when witnessing to them, leaving them where the people are not at home, distributing them from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Just a Line to Let You Know </span><span class="font2">of the joyful experiences I am having with the phonograph in the business sections. As I walk into a business place I ask the manager If he has about four minutes to spare. Most times they will stutter around and say, 'What is it that you have?’ but while they are stuttering I am setting up my phonograph and tell them that I have something that I want them to hear, and they will stay and listen until the record is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;It has been a great joy to use the phonograph in the business section. I have placed much literature with the phonograph that I could not have placed otherwise. It helps to find the sheep. The Lord has placed the phonograph in our hands, and we should use it to his glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;I have had so much joy in the phonograph work, and, as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> says, ‘one doesn’t get so tired if one carries the phonograph and uses it.’ I say, ‘I would like for you to hear this,’ or, ‘I will play a lecture for you,’ and then open the phonograph and put on the record, tell them the name of the lecture, and run it for them. I very seldom ask if they would like to hear it; for they seem to have all kinds of excuses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;When arranging for back calls I say, ‘I can come and play the phonograph for you,’ or, ‘I will come and play it for you.’ If they do not make a definite date I ascertain when they will be at their place of business or home (I work business territory), and when they will be in a position to listen, and take it there. I am friendly and say, ‘Well, I have come to play the phonograph,’ and I run it for them. After playing one record I hesitate a little, and if they ask a question I answer it. If not, I repeat something said in the record about the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth, the dead know not anything, or there is no trinity, then play two more records and do the same thing after each of them. Then I say, ‘Here are the books that have this in printed form, and much more. You ought to have them.’ They usually take from one to five bound books at a time, and they take booklets too. Then I say, ‘We can come back next week at this same time, and you can invite anyone to hear.’ At the second back call I show the books again and arrange for another back call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“When I work homes I use the same method as in the business. I could tell you the most wonderful experiences we have had with the phonograph and how the people have taken books and booklets because of it, and how they enjoyed the lectures and were glad to arrange for back calls. It certainly is the most wonderful thing, and I thank Jehovah for this arrangement to bring the truth to the people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">When you move or/and change your address, send in the old as well as your new address, designating whether it is for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> or both. All you need is a penny post card, or you may obtain from the post office Form 22-B, which is provided by them free for this purpose, as it is a great help to the post office department to have the correct addresses on magazines at all times. All you have to do is put a penny stamp on this card, and the information asked thereon, and address to the Watch Tower or The Golden Age. Send your change of address two weeks in advance. If you do this there will be no delay in receiving your magazines. Pioneers will continue to send in their change of address as heretofore.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Phonograph Orders Heavy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren in the United States, and, in fact, all parts of the world, are putting to use the phonograph and the new records. The brethren appreciate the importance of the use of the phonograph anil therefore are ordering as they never have before. The orders received now will take about three months to fill, as we are filling them according to dates received. If you want one of the Society’s portable phonographs, which are the very best that can be had for the Lord's work, place your order now, as it will be at least three months before you can get it. An extra force is working on the manufacture of these instruments. Our production enables us to fill orders for more than 1,000 a month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Society has just sent out a letter to all I’TJI owners advising them that we are now in position to handle this work. Those desiring to take advantage of this arrangement should advise the office as soon as possible. If you have one of the wet-battery PTM’s and have not received a letter and are interested in transforming this machine into a No. 3 sound equipment, write us about it. We shall be glad to send you one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two-Speed All-Electric PTM</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is now in a position to supply brethren who own the all-, electrle PTM with a two-speed motor for this equipment, which will enable them to put on the 78- as well as 33J-r.p.m. records. The cost of this motor is $10. With this additional equipment the all-electric machine is ideal for use at “Exposed” meetings or at any other place where alternating current is available. You can replace the motor yourself. There is no need to send the all-electric machine to the Society for this change.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Driving Them Out into the Open</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">To the religionists who deceive and defraud the people, the message of truth is like the hornet’s sting. It burns and itches, so that they lose caution, reserve and presence of mind and act without wisdom. In general, the priests, bishops and other ecclesiastical big shots have kept well under cover in the war against the truth. The dirty work is left to the politicians, judges and strong-arm squads. The clerics would not show themselves even when 2,630,000 people urgently invited them to fight it out in the open. But, now, the gentlemen of the cloth are being greatly tormented by the stinging truths of the “Exposed” series of lectures going forth to the people by radio and phonograph. As the clear-cut, decisive and unanswerable truths have gone forth the priestly racketeers have become frantic with fear. Their pastures are in danger of being spoiled, and they wail and weep because of the stings. Read a few samples and be glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Peter H. M. Wynhoven, who designates himself a “Right Reverend Monsignor”, greatly frightened the management of WNBO, New Orleans, with a distinctively Catholic threat of boycott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Edward I. Halahan, who is chief collector of a parasitic growth called “Saint Bernard’s Church”, let out a fearsome squawk and immediately put his “Catholic daughters” at work on a distinctively Catholic job of suppressing free speech. One Callis-tus Seibark, male but wears skirts, of Bloomington, III., yelped loudly that he was insulted. Bishop (?) Desmond howled mightily against KALB of Alexandria, La., and immediately left for Boston “for needed rest”. And so it goes. Catholic Action, with its beskirted prelates out in front for a change, thinks it can stop the downpour of truth by bulldozing methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few stations became fearful and ignominiously canceled their contracts. A great majority of stations are standing firm, and still sending forth the “Exposed” series for the benefit of people of good will. Therefore, brethren, rejoice, take courage and continue to press the battle to the gate. Continue to shout against her. Co-operate with the radio stations. Advertise the programs. Keep the phonographs busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">radio sometime and not bother to attend a series of meetings. Therefore, it seems best to keep the distribution of these two announcements separate. Radio folders may be given out at the final meeting of the series, in addition to covering your territory with them at appropriate times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">is very gratifying to note the increase in number of publishers and that I he total number of hours in tlie field has increased by nearly 100,000. The question arises, Why are the booklets 2,000,000 behind last year's six months’ total? We have had two new booklets this year, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font2"> and now comes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon.</span><span class="font2"> Can your company make up in lire next six months the deficit of the first six? Are you doing more work with the sound equipment, or less, than last year? Should we not have as many listeners, if not more, with all the extra phonographs in use and more sound car equipment? These are some questions for your consideration. Tlie report for April, we hope, will wipe out a considerable part of this deficit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Do You Renew Your Subscriptions Promptly?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">It is a great help to the brethren in the office who handle subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> if you send in your renewal promptly. One month before your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> subscription expires, a numbered renewal slip is pasted under the front cover. Fill out this slip, printing your name and address plainly thereon. As soon as you receive this notice of expiration in the magazine, mail it with your remittance to the Watch Tower or The Golden Age. Tlie sooner sent in, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is also very helpful to the Society if in large companies the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions are turned in to the company servant or to someone appointed to take care of this matter. Where such a person is appointed, the subscription slips should be sent in once a week, being sure that the individual slips are properly filled out. The subscription slips should beai<sup>-</sup> tiie signature of the company servant on the line marked “Signed”, and these should be attached to a letter itemizing the subscriptions enclosed therewith, and sent in with one money order or check covering the entire amount. However, if no one in the company has time to do this, then the individuals should, of course, mail them in direct as soon as they get their expiration notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1’lease do not include in the middle of letters taking up other matters your subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> All we need is the subscription blank and your remittance. The one exception is in the ease of companies as mentioned above, which is a convenience to the office; otherwise send your slips in promptly, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Exposed” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The correspondence received at the office indicates that some of the brethren become discouraged because they do not see the attendance they anticipated at the first meeting, and quit the series entirely as a result. This should not be. Persistence will bring results. The most successful meetings are those in which there has been persistence. There is a tremendous amount of prejudice in the average mind, which must be dispelled before the people will put themselves out to any great extent. Calling back upon the same people three or more times with the phonograph will do much to dispel this prejudice. By going over this territory three or more times you have opportunity not only to contact these people that many more times and to aid them to get a proper understanding of the Lord's purposes, but also to dispel any additional prejudice that might be developed by the Devil or some of his agents’ calling upon them in fin effort to discourage their attendance at the meeting. In the final analysis the attendance at lhe meeting is only one factor of the work that is accomplished as a result of these series; therefore, persevere. There is no question that the time is here when the Lord is going to assemble the great multitude. Joseph’s brethren are in need of the provisions the Lord has for them.

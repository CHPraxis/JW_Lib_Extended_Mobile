</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>X</sup>A deadly fume or a life-giving perfume—-which will it be? It depends on whether a person is goatlike or sheeplike. It is one message but there are two reactions. Goatish persons think it stinks and hold their nostrils. Sheeplike persons think it fragrant and breathe it in. The knowledge of Jehovah is that powerful !—2 Cor. 2 :14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> No commercial concern handles this knowledge. Jehovah has chosen a better way of distribution. He uses Christ Jesus, and leads his servants on earth in a triumphal procession. It makes perceptible the odor of the knowledge of God. Goats think it a stench, sheep a fragrance. Where is work like this being done? “In every place!”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> We are thankful to Jehovah that in August his triumphal procession will diffuse the fragrance of the knowledge of God “in every place”— yes, in unassigned territory and territory not worked during the past six months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Beginning with August the special offer in such seldom-worked ter</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Attend</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>the District Assembly!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> August is another district assembly month. And attending one of these assemblies is a must for everyone who did not attend one in July. Many happy witnesses will be attending more than one this summer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Do not have your actions saying: “The table of Jehovah is contemptible.” Instead, show genuine appreciation for its delectable, life-giving provisions by attending all four days. And not only attend but show you are conscious of your spiritual need by taking in all the sessions, paying close attention and making notes. Return home overflowing with vital things to tell your good-will persons. And, of course, include the children in all this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> It is not too late to write for rooms. If you do not receive word about them before leaving, word will ritory may include </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span><span class="font3"> These two plus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and three booklets may be placed on a $1 contribution. Publishers may obtain books from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font3"> at 20 cents apiece. For books so placed congregations may request credit from the Society. Can we place all our older books this year? Your work during this last month of the service year will answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> What of territory that has been worked within the past six months? Bring the sheep three books and three booklets on a contribution of $1.50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> “Oil and perfume rejoice the heart,” said the wise man. How great is the joy of sheeplike people when you bring them the life-giving fragrance regularly by studying with them! The July 1955 and 1956 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font3"> outline the way you can care for sheep in unassigned and seldom-worked territories. Use those be awaiting you upon arrival. Nor is it too late to send in your application for volunteer service. Doing so enables those in charge to know what co-operation they can expect. Put your shoulder to the wheel. By more assisting, more will be able to enjoy more of the sessions and also more of the Held service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> That is right, do not overlook the field service. One main purpose served by our assemblies is the giving of a great witness. By each one's sharing in the house-to-house and/or street advertising the most effective witness possible will be given. Be sure to do your part in preaching the Word during the assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> So continue seeking first the Kingdom, letting nothing keep you from attending the district assembly all four days. And remember, the busier you then are the happier you will be, for “there is more happiness in giving.” suggestions to help them associate w<sup>r</sup>ith the New World society.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Persons who do not take the book offer are not necessarily nose-holding goats. Diffuse more fragrance. Offer them the magazines. The transition is easy, such as: “While you don’t feel you can obtain these books, I’m sure you will want these latest copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">They tell you more about the Kingdom we have talked about. These are yours on a contribution of only 10 cents.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> What goal should we set for ourselves in August? To make the fragrance of the knowledge of God perceptible to the sheep not only “in every place” but in every way—from house to house, by back-calls and home Bible studies. Will you be at an assembly this month? Great will be the fragrance of true knowledge diffused at assembly cities! Be one of the fragrance distributors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> By being a publisher in August you join in with the apostle in exclaiming “thanks be to God” for this unusual privilege. “In every place” bring Jehovah’s kingdom message. Let it be to the goats a deadly, deathly fume. You are triumphant. The sheep recognize it as a vital, life-giving perfume I</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>The Full-Time Ministry Calls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Every season of the year is a good one for every part-time minister to give serious consideration to the call for full-time service; but especially is the passing of summer a good time for all you vacation pioneers to consider stepping up to the regular pioneer service. You have been making a test of Jehovah and you know what bountiful blessings he pours out on those who bring full-time tithes into his treasure house. Why not continue to receive these blessings? If you can at all see your way clear to do so, write the Society immediately for an application. Fill it out and have your congregation servant send it in, and we shall be glad to give it consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font3"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knowing the true value of &quot;The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of what value Is just a copy or two of &quot;The Watchtower”? A lone, borrowed Arabic copy helped two publishers In Sierra Leone to obtain fourteen subscriptions in two hours.. (257) One copy placed with an Australian business manager caused him to order fifty more copies for distribution among his employees. (81) Two copies sparked so much interest in a Finnish storekeeper that, after a few studies, he went into the service, becoming a 30-hour-a-month publisher even before he was baptized. (143)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The value of “The Watchtower” is recognized even by some of the clergy, such as the Costa Rican Roman Catholic priest who obtained a copy on the street and hid it under his robe. A modern-day Nicodemus? (120) And like the British Guianan Lutheran minister who said: &quot;I take ‘The Watchtower’ because it gives me real Bible facts for my sermons.” (98) And especially like the Japanese preacher who quit false worship for the true, writing to the Society: &quot;Nothing has given me more happiness than knowing the true value of ‘The Watchtower.’ ” (190)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The Watchtower” helps one to be conscious of his spiritual need. That is why an Isolated Uruguayan subscriber, hearing missionaries were coming, looked them up. During their twelveday stay she had twelve studies with them. (282) And also why a Cypriote subscriber who had moved away, upon his return to the island, tried, but in vain, to find the one who had obtained his subscription. To his joy that one found him in the house-to-house work. He had benefited from &quot;The Watchtower” and was ready for a study. (124) ‘Knowing &quot;The Watchtower’s” true value,’ let us diligently keep on placing it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bible Studies Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Really how could I ever do so, unless someone guided me?” was the Ethiopian’s reply to Philip. Realizing his responsibility to teach, Philip “opened his mouth” and began a Bible study. Many today who have Bibles and the Society’s literature need the same loving guidance—a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Home Bible study results are gratifying, especially when you cultivate the interest to fruition to prompt baptism. A New Zealand pioneer studied with a man. Soon the whole family was studying, publishing and considering baptism. (218)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An old man in Thailand, who could not read and whose wife was blind, listened while his granddaughters studied. Soon he became so interested that he learned to read and continued the study with his wife. Although confined to his home he is the best magazine placer in the congregation. (276)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A great effort is required on the part of our brothers in Java to accommodate some interested persons with home Bible studies. Every Saturday afternoon several brothers leave by car and travel fifty miles over rough road to conduct studies, often returning home at midnight. (181)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Like the eunuch, you too, even if a new publisher, can help others to rejoice over the truth found in the Bible. (189) Supplying good-will persons with literature is necessary, but they must be guided through essential home Bible study. If you plant, water and cultivate, you have Jehovah’s promise of increase in your congregation.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Improving Your Sermons</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">(Part 3}</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom publisher can overcome objections, indifference and opposition only by diligent study and application of right principles. What do you do when a householder injects Irrelevant matters into the conversation? Does this get you off on a tangent and throw you off your speech track? If so, consider these points:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> We cannot ignore objections, but we can overcome them. So when you meet an objection, analyze the situation. Is the interruption really an objection? Oftentimes by sticking right to your theme you can absorb the person’s remarks and use them as a basis for a tactful reply without actually making an issue of them. This calls for being flexible; it means that you must cultivate adaptability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> For example, if a householder says : “I’m busy,” you might counter with: “I certainly appreciate that these are busy days and because I’m busy too I’ll take only a few minutes to explain the nature of my call.” Hence, by acknowledging it and showing consideration for the householder, very often we can overcome the difficulty. If, however, the householder is genuinely busy, then it would be best, if possible, to leave two magazines on a contribution of 10c and to arrange for a future call at a more convenient time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Another point regarding adaptability is this: Usually objections are peculiar to certain localities. In northern New England it could be the war issue; in the South it could be our views on hell. Publishers should be prepared to handle these</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Full-Time Ministry ... (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Some of you vacation pioneers may not be able to step up into the regular pioneer work immediately but you may be able to keep on meeting the vacation pioneer requirements. If so, why not write the Society at once asking to have your vacation pioneer status extended for the month or months that you can continue as such? Perhaps during this time you will see your way clear to respond to the regular pioneer call. To help you to better appreciate your opportunities why not reconsider the main article of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> March 15, 1956, as well as paragraphs 22 and 28 of the second study article of the issue of May 15? objections by being familiar with the sermons outlined in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">and by being skilled in their flexible presentation. Also, you can prepare a sermon on the main objections that are met in your locality, which sermon would also explain the purpose of your call, and then go into the offer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> If, however, you are confronted with a genuine objection, where the householder really desires an answer, then you should proceed tactfully to answer it. For example, a person might be opposed to our work because we do not believe in “hell.” You could say: “Perhaps you have been misinformed as to our belief in hell. We do believe in the Bible hell.” Then you could proceed, to the extent necessary, to refute false religion’s idea of hell, using the Bible or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font3"> to enlighten the person and to clear away the obstruction. This may open the way for presenting the offer or for a future call. Remember to be “always ready to make a defense ... but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>B</sup> Analyze the objections people raise. Observe the effect of your answers. Adapt yourself to the situation that arises at each door. Always look for new ways to meet the objections that are encountered in your area. Try them in your territory, and by always being alert to these things you can become a more flexible and coherent Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">/or handling </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">this part:</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Under the supervision of a mature brother arrange several scenes that embody the points of adaptability and that overcome objections common in your area. Then have the brother who handles this analyze each scene as it is presented and point out how we can all improve along these lines.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> And remember, all you part-time ministers, vacation pioneering is not limited to summer, nor to young folks. Any time you can see your way clear to pioneer for two weeks and devote at least 75 hours for the full month enroll as a vacation pioneer. And do not put this off until tomorrow if you can do it today!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Starting September 2, 1956, circuit servants will give the public talk “Has God’s Purpose for Mankind Failed?” At circuit assemblies starting in the fall district servants will give the public talk “What Will Armageddon. Mean for You?”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Training Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (3 min.) Short, lively introductory talk on the importance of the training' program as an aid to growing to maturity. Growth is a sign of life and progress. What parents do not wish to see their child grow? Boys and girls thrill in growing up. Progress to spiritual maturity is just as exciting and more important by far. To help publishers grow spiritually beautiful and strong Is the purpose of the training program. Everyone should keenly appreciate its helpfulness and want to take full advantage of It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (8 min.) Two sisters conversing about training program. Both never realized program was a Scriptural arrangement and requirement until circuit servant drove points home. Together they review notes on his talk and comment on scriptures showing where Jesus trained his disciples; where Paul says that he held back nothing that was profitable to his associates but taught them; also where he bid them to let their advancement be seen by all men. (Luke 8:1, 9; Acts 20: 17-20; Eph. 4: 11-15) Both see the need of taking the training program more seriously. They make definite arrangements to go out in service with a renewed determination to improve their ministry.—1 Tim. 4: 15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (1 min.) Making arrangements and following through only one feature of training work. Not to grow lopsided, must engage In all features —door-to-door, back-call, Bible study work, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (6 min.) Two brothers discuss circuit servant’s observations as to their progress in training work. Fine progress in house-to-house work, but he stressed need for improvement in back-call and Bible study fields. Both acknowledge weakness. The one being assisted asks, &quot;Do you think I can give a back-call sermon?” Companion reminds him that he asked the same thing about 3- to 8-minute sermons when starting out and now he does fine. &quot;Do you know how long you talked at the last door?” asks the mature companion. “No.” &quot;You spoke eight minutes. I timed you. All you have to do is enlarge this same sermon another few minutes by using just one or two more scriptures and you have your back-call sermon complete.” Both agree to work together in developing a good sermon and practice on each other. Make definite arrangements for going back-calling. The one being assisted expresses desire to grow to maturity, so that he may be a help to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Summary. Brothers with a desire to grow spiritually have a healthy view of the training program. They seek assistance, want to learn, desire to enlarge their privileges. Maturity opens up new avenues for greater service opportunities and privileges for all. (2 Cor. 9:6; Mal. 3: 10) Recognize training program as a Scriptural requirement, a loving provision. Take advantage of it. Flan to do things together—work on sermons together, go from house to house together, make back-calls together. Assist one another to thoroughly accomplish your ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Working Unassigned or Rural Territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Why not combine Kingdom preaching with the pleasurable outdoors this summer by working in outlying territories? Remember, our purpose in the country will be to preach, not merely to have a good time. Many valuable hours are lost if a whole group waits in the car while just one gives a sermon. Good organization and co-operation beforehand will work to a greater saving of time and a more pleasant day in rural witnessing for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 mln.) After service meeting group car captain goes over rural witnessing plans with his car group. Definite time and place for departure are set so that group will leave early enough to start witnessing in territory at 9 a.m. or earlier, since farmers and villagers are usually up early. Literature supplies are checked, back-calls arranged, the territory prepared and studied out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (1 min.) First steps are: Plan ahead, have definite arrangements, get started early. The service captain has further arrangements to make journey more enjoyable and service more efficient, as we shall see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (13 min.) Group starts out on time. On the way car captain describes territory, type of people to be met, when territory was last worked, etc. Suggests using traveling time to go over sermon that has been suggested for use in unassigned and rural territory. All favorable to suggestion. Proceed to discuss various approaches and the sermon. Car captain calls on publisher for a model demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theme: God's Kingdom</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">7. Have literature that tells of Kingdom; make presentation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Group arrives at territory. Since there are a few small villages to work captain arranges for a group to work them while others work outlying rurals. Plans are made to meet for lunch, replenish literature supplies, check progress. Those who worked scattered territory can now work the villages, while those who worked in the towns can do the remaining rurals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (3 min.) There is much work to do. Make every moment count. Plan ahead. Use travel time wisely. Keep publishers busy while in territory so that minimum time is spent sitting in cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What about back-calls? Since the group began working the nearest territory at the beginning of the campaign, each week as they go out farther they pass their calls from previous weeks. So most back-calls can be made returning from territory. Here, again, do not sit in the car and wait. The car driver might wait to see that the publisher gets invited in the house, then go on to next call and on the way make the not-at-home calls. Return after agreed time has elapsed. With good organization, rural witnessing will be not only a pleasant way to spend summer week ends, but also a theocratically productive way to show love to your neighbors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If you are away from your home congregation at the end of a month, be sure to send your report slips to the congregation servant just before the end of the month. Do not become an irregular publisher because you neglected to report. And, of course, whether at home or away from home, definitely arrange to share in field service each and every month.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah's servants are on the offensive. They go from one triumph to another. And they triumph, not by resorting to fleshly weapons, but by wielding “the sword of the spirit.’’ Yes, by fearless perseverance in Kingdom preaching we triumph over enemy opposition, visible and invisible.—Ps. 110 : 2; Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> We have received much spiritual upbuilding at the recent assemblies. We should, therefore, now be in lighting trim so as to make September, the first month of our new service year, a truly triumphant month. In our house-to-house ministry we shall continue to feature the bound books. Concentrate on territory not previously called on with these. If all your territory has been covered, then go over it again. Some of the most fruitful territory in Brooklyn is that receiving the literature offer every three weeks !</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> And then follow through. Placing literature is like establishing a beachhead. Thereafter we must spread out into back-calls and home Bible studies. We must engage in</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Right Way to Cover Congregation Territory</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Save time and effort I Be more effective! Before going out in the service, plan! No study conductor in charge of group witnessing should neglect planning. Beforehand he decides two things: (1) What territory is to be worked? (2) How can the territory best be covered by the group ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Knowing the answers, the conductor can buy out the opportune time for the publishers. How? By making assignments at the service center. No confused procession is there then, but a triumphal procession in which each fragrance distributor knows his place. For greater efficiency some conductors give publishers a slip of paper showing the apartment houses, blocks or streets to be covered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Unless training others, mature publishers work alone. In this way more lost sheep can be found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The house-to-house record ? A convenient aid for keeping track of sheep. Goats think the Kingdom message is a deadly fume. No need to keep their addresses. Sheep show interest. Their names and addresses you will want to keep.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> On whom do we call back? Sheephand-to-hand combat with false teachings, indifference and materialism, if our preaching is to triumph over our enemies. In carrying on this work let us show not only zeal and boldness, but also wisdom and especially love. At the same time do not overlook the new or weak ministers. They still need our help if they are to share in the final triumph with us.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Was This Your Placement?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Th rep books were recently sent to the Society’s office with the following note enclosed: “I have read these books and would like to have someone else benefit from them.” The local congregation has been informed so that a back-call can now be made. But, did not the publisher who made this placement withhold good from this person of good will? Did he not deny himself the blessed privilege of aiding this one in the worship of Jehovah? Be sure to make notation of your placements and then to make return calls promptly, having in mind the starting of home Bible studies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark30"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">like persons of course. This calls for correct addresses, carefulness and observation. Do you ever meet sheeplike ones who are genuinely too busy? Do you call back on them? A good time would be when you make the not-at-home calls. You feel more satisfied with yourself by calling on the not-at-homes. It is good to make these calls before the group goes back to the territory again. A big advantage is that a different day of the ■week often finds them home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> No territory is worked in the right way unless we do this: make a reasonable effort to witness to the occupants of every home. Two prime responsibilities the study conductor has: (1) He will se'e that each territory checked out to him is worked with the regular offer and also with magazines. (2) He will check closely to see that life-giving knowledge is brought to sheeplike ones by means of back-calls and studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> With an eye alert to buy out time for the publishers, the conductor obtains territory for group witnessing close to his service center. How much? No more territory than is really needed. This usually leaves some territory open for individual publishers and pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> To all who check out territory</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Bethel and Gilead Applicant Opportunities</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup>Have you ever thought of serving at Bethel, or as a missionary? Do you qualify for these treasured privileges of service? If so, you will be happy to know that at all district assemblies this summer the Society has scheduled a meeting for Bethel and Gilead applicants Sunday morning at!): 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To be eligible for Bethel service brothers and sisters must be between 17 and 35 years of age, in good health, willing and desirous of doing hard daily work. Gilead applicants must have a minimum of two years in the pioneer service, be between the ages of 21 and 40, be in good health and willing to go anywhere in the world as missionaries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Both of these special services open the way to endless privileges within the forward-marching, unending New World society. There is no greater privilege that you could have than serving in either of these fields. So, if you qualify, give the matter serious and prayerful thought and take advantage of the opportunity of making application at your district assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the Scriptural rule applies: “Each one will carry his own load of responsibility.” Each one, then, who checks out territory agrees to take up those two prime responsibilities mentioned in paragraph six.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Every four months publishers are required to check in their territory. Can a territory be checked out again by the same publisher? Yes, provided (1) the congregation does not need the territory and (2) the publisher is carrying “his own load of responsibility.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Planning is a responsibility that falls especially on the magazine-territory servant. Proper territory coverage with the regular offer and with magazines requires much thought. For instance, there is a tendency to cover some territory more than others. What of the territory that is worked less often? Is it receiving proper attention? If not, the magazine-territory servant arranges with the congregation servant for it to be covered by group witnessing. Or pioneers may be able to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Remember the goal: to work all congregation territory every four months. This may be either with the regular offer or with magazines. With magazines we work rapidly. With the regular offer we try to be thorough. Sheep are there. Working territory in the right way will find them.</span></p></li></ul>

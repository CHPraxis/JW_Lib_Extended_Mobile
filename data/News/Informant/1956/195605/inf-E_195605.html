<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> We may say we Jove our neighbors, but would it really be so if we were to let them perish at Armageddon, without a word of how they might have survived? Or if we should forget all about them, after having placed literature with them and promised to return? Or if we should leave them to stand alone after having helped them to get started in field service? This would not be real love, but only professed love. For love to be beneficial we must express it in deed as well as in word. —1 John 3:18, ,VW.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> ‘‘We're going to the assembly, are you?” This will be a prevalent question around all Kingdom Halls throughout the country. Why so? Because all are familiar with the abundant provisions for our spiritual needs that Jehovah pours out so generously for his people w'hen ‘assembled together.’ What will be your answer? Affirmative, of course! Not for a part of the assembly only, but for the entire foub days. Do not be satisfied w'ith a portion of the riches of Jehovah. Carefully make plans to share in the entire ‘meal.’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministering in Deed as Well as in Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The truth is the most precious possession anyone can possibly have. It must be appreciated and displayed to receive and keep Jehovah’s love, which leads to life. (Alatt. 7:21) This Jehovah’s witnesses and trood-will persons do, as shown in the ‘’Yearbook.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> person learns the truth after years of searching for an understanding of the Bible, it is cause for rejoicing. On pages 100 and 101 enjoy the experience of a man eighty-three years of age in British Honduras who learned the truth and now applies it in deed as well as in word as a zealous minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Realizing the need of putting Kingdom interests first in these critical days, a detective sergeant of Scotland Yard (103) resigned and took up the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among Jehovah's faithful servants who minister in deed as well as in word are circuit and district servants These brothers continuously expend themselves, under all kinds of circumstances, to serve their brothers and to care for good-will interest. (Mexico, 210, 211)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After being a nun for thirty-three years a Catholic sister learned the truth. Could she love in word and not in deed? She thought so, for a while But on learning more truth she realized that this could not be and she made necessary adjustments in order to minister in deed as well as in word.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Witnessing Effectively to Catholics</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> How many times have you said: “1 wish there were some way to make Catholic people listen long enough at the door so the truth could be gotten to them.&quot; If Catholic people heed the information published in answer to a question in one of their magazines (February. 1956, issue, 1/c.ww/mr </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of the Kacred Heart),</span><span class="font3"> the doors of more Catholic homes may open to us. In answer to the question. &quot;Is it wrong to refuse to argue with Jehovah’s witnesses?” the magazine said that while it is wrong to argue with Jehovah’s witnesses because of the lack of knowledge of the ordinary Catholic, still they may listen to us with ‘‘an assumed air of empty-headed politeness” and &quot;not seem to be offended, but only uninterested.” Further, they are told (hat they might try to frustrate the witness by asking for further proofs and then, finally, &quot;offer him a cup of tea and a piece of cake.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> We should be quick to take advantage of this lapse in the “prison regulations&quot; by speaking the (ruth to these imprisoned ones, if they will listen, we must try to make them think. Our sermons should be thought arousing and should offer them much proof of the hope the Scriptures hold forth. What wight we say to c^tch and hold the attention of householders who say; “I’m Catholic and wouldn’t be interested” ?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> And let us not deprive new publishers of needed assistance. Many published for the first time in April. Help and encourage them to serve again this month. In 1955 we had a peak of 187,120 publishers in April, but this number dropped to 173.310 apostle Peter were standing on your doorstep this morning, you would want to listen to him, wouldn't you?&quot; Then point out how Teter wrote two letters to us to remind us of God's wonderful promises. Read 2 E’eter 1:12, 15, 19, The promise for the future, 2 I’eter .‘1: 13, all Catholics pray for when they pray, “Thy Kingdom come.Thy will be done on earth.” Thus, in prayer we talk to God, but when we read the Scriptures. God talks to us. The study of the Bible, then, is essential to have instruction from God. Present literature as an aid to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Also, when you are told “1 am a Catholic&quot; you might say that you have noted most Catholics are sincerely devoted to their religion, and the Holy Scriptures speak highly of these virtues, sincerity and devotion. To add to these virtues, Acts 17:11 recommends daily study of the Scriptures to become “noble-minded.&quot; Also, Pope Plus XII, in the foreword of the Douay Bible, agrees with Jerome that “to ignore the Scriptures is to ignore Christ.” so Bible study is necessary. The apostle Peter said we should be able to give an answer of the hope in us (1 Pet. 3: 15), but we have to be informed about it to do so. Peter’s hope was a new heavens and a new earth (2 Pet. 3:13). where justice would dwell and sickness, sorrow and death would be ended. (Rev. 21:1-4) For us to know more about it and to help others know, we must study the Bible. Illustrate the helpfulness of the literature and make the offer in May and to 160.187 in June. Thus, one out of every seven that published in zVpril did not continue! Let us en-: deavor to avoid such a decrease this year. Did love prompt you to help a new one to publish in April? Then let love prompt you to help that one to continue publishing. If he started in the magazine work by distributing the special issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">encourage him to get a few magazines every month and distribute them in house-to-house work, in street work and among his friends. Then help him to branch out into other features of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> There is a warning message to sound, an instructing work to do and a training program to support These will be accomplished only* by love. To keep talking of love is not enough. We must he walking in love. We must love in deed as well as in word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (3 min.) </span><span class="font2">School servant or another capable brother points out that this is the first time all of Jehovah’s people will present the new book in a campaign. Having studied it, we know the value of its contents and vant to make it available to people of good will. This requires activity on our part, tirst preparing a sermon and then using it regularly in the field. The congregation is invited to develop the following sermon, as has been done previously. Brothers should he encouraged to study the outline before coming to the meeting, and should have pencil and paper to jot down notes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Developing Sermon (15 mm.) </span><span class="font2">Introduction: “I [or mj companion and I] am doing a community service by calling attention to a matter that may change your entire outlook for the future. It is in reference to what the Bible terms the battle of Armageddon I'ndoubtedly you have heard of it and know there are many different conceptions as to what Armageddon is. General MacArthur recently stated: ‘We have had our last chance. If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, our Armageddon will be at our door.' Also Cardinal Spellman stated: ‘Security and stability are nowhere on the horizon. Perhaps we see the world hurrying to Armageddon, from which no nation may hope to survive.’ What is Armageddon <sup>L&gt;</sup> It is very important for us to understand what it is, what it will do, when it will occur and what we must do to survive. 1 can stay only a few minutes, as I want to share this important information with many of our neighbors, so just briefly this is what the Bible tells us about Armageddon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nations gathered to Armageddon Rev. 16: 14, 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Accomplishes the end of wicked system &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jer. 25: 31, 33</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Will occur in this generation [Paraphrase thought] Matt. 24: 3-8, 34, 36</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How we may survive Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeph, 2; 2, 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conclusion. &quot;Isn't it good news to realize there will be survivors of Armageddon&quot;' I am glad that I could share this information with you and trust that you can see that Armageddon, the selective war, will destroy only the wicked and that there will be righteous survivors As we read in that I last scripture, if we want to survive Armageddon we need knowledge on the subject. To this end the Watchtower Society has published this book, ‘You May Survive Armageddon into God's New World.’ Notice here on pages 367 and 368 that it enumerates 42 types and prophecies of the earthly heirs of God’s new world. Did you realize there were so many examples in the Bible to indicate survivors of Armageddon<sup>9 </sup>And here on page 14. paragraph 13, we are told . . . [read portion or make points]. 1 feel sure you will want to profit from the contents of this fine Bible study aid and this booklet, which you may have for the small contribution of only 50c. It will definitely aid you to learn more about Armageddon and how you may survive.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| Increasing Meeting Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">' Congregation Servant (10 min.) </span><span class="font2">Discusses local congregation attendance, comparing it with that of nation as outlined in October, 1955, “Informant” and pointing out seriousness of all regularly attending. What can be done and a hat definite program can be put into action to improve attendance? The following: (1 &gt;&nbsp;Warm, friendly spirit should prevail at all meetings. &lt;2i All should he meeting-attendance &lt;&nbsp;onscious and observe those who miss in order to aid them; (3) Bneourage and assist one another in conversation, stopping to bring them etc.; (4) When contacting irregular and new publishers (who miss meetings) regarding service privileges, help them to realize the importance of attending: (5) Have something definite in mind to say: 16) Servants and conductors will call on any needing special attention and point out seriousness of attending. (Heb 10 25) Understandingly help irregular attenders to see. without unduly prying into personal affairs, how their problems and difficulties can be adjusted so they can attend Many times it is just a matter of getting into the habit of not attending: i7i Goodwill persons should be invited and made welcome. For good results to be forthcoming stress that the whole congregation must encourage and aid one another. Note how servant or conductor makes special call on Brother Seldom Attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (6 min.) He sits down with Seldom, makes brief comment about back-calls he just made and begins talking about the many blessings received at meetings. Being neither apologetic nor demanding, he tells Seldom his presence at meetings has been missed, and tactfully goes on, saying, “It is true we all have our problems of one kind or another We’re tired when we come home at night and it takes extra effort to get ready and to attend, but when we make excuses for ourselves we fool no one but ourselves. We feel much better if we attend, even though a bit tired, rather than fight with our conscience and wear ourselves out mentally and spiritually that way All of us together want to face facts and live now so we might live in new world ” (Phil 3. 13-16: 1 Pet. 1: 13-16. NW) Seldom agrees that he has just let family matters, negligence and unimportant things take his time. He knows that he should attend, that he has slipped into a bad habit, but wants I to do better, and expresses appreciation for the friendly call and brotherly encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant (1 min.) Per</span><span class="font2">sons with whom studies are held should be encouraged to go to the congregation book study and Kingdom Hall. The following has worked well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (6 min.) Conductor (using list provided by Bible study servant in accordance with April demonstration “Help New Ones to Preach”) talks to sister who has conducted study six months or more without much success in getting the person to meetings. They arrange to go to study together. On closing with prayer he invites the person to go to the meetings. He points out the benefits, drawing heavily upon Jehovah’s Word to show why attendance is necessary. We do not want to be like the Hebrews referred to at Hebrews 5: 11-14 and 6: 1-3 (tactfully use these texts): show importance of always moving forward in knowledge and service. Fxtend invitation to next meeting, as reference is made to Hebrews 10: 25 Person expresses desire to a ttend</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “I delight to do thy will, O my God.” was the thought that filled the mind at the time of dedication. It was a delight to know Jehovah's will and to be in position to carry it out by preaching about his new world and warning of Armageddon's approaching storm. To keep the first joyful delight of dedication there must be constant, untiring service Work? Yes, but pleasant work gladly accepted at dedication.-—Ps. 40: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">-’ How can I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">increase</span><span class="font3"> my original delight in doing Jehovah's will, you might ask? Increased service brings more joy and increased delight. Why not. then, pioneer?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Prayerfully consider your position. Are you able to engage in the ministry for 100 hours a month? Do you qualify for this grand service? Can you change your schedule of life to fit pioneer requirements? If so, do not wait. Start pioneering now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Are one or more members of your family pioneering? Many families have planned their affairs so that one or more can pioneer. It requires effort and close co-operation, it is true, but it results in added blessings for the entire family. Has your family considered such an arrangement?

<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Vacation pioneer service has been arranged for those who cannot be regular pioneers. Seasonal and part-time workers, as well as housewives and young ministers of school age, are encouraged to vacation pioneer. It is a joy to see right now hundreds of vacation pioneer applications streaming in from zealous young ministers who wish to use their summer vacation period praising Jehovah. If you do not have an application and want to enjoy this service, send for an application right away.</span></p></li></ul>

The reading of Jehovah's witnesses’ publications has made me eager to become one of the army of witnesses. How do I go about it, getting baptized, preaching, etc.?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Be on guard, theocratic soldiers I Be ever alert to use ‘‘the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” in the figlit. we have, “not against blood and flesh, but . . . against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12. 17.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Practice leads to expertness of handling. An excellent way of becoming an expert wielder of this sword is to use it without letup in private study and at congregation meetings, and then in the field, ministering to others.

<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Congregation and Disfellowshiping Committees</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> A question has come up in regard to the propriety of sisters who serve on the congregation committee serving on a committee that judges and acts in disfellowshiping cases. The following is to clarify the matter and to set forth the Society’s policy, which is in keeping with the Scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> First of all, it should be understood that the congregation committee (made up of the congregation servant, assistant congregation servant and Bible study servant) is not always the same as a disfellowshiping committee. The function of each of the two committees follows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Congregation Committee:</span><span class="font3"> Where there are not sufficient brothers to care for all servant positions of the congregation committee, sisters may be appointed to serve as assistant congregation servant or Bible study servant. Where no qualified,brothers are available and no brothers are already appointed as servants, a sister may be appointed to serve as congregation servant. As brothers qualify for servant appointments, according to paragraph 1)2 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity,</span><span class="font3"> they should be recommended. As part of the congregation committee sisters may handle matters along with the brothers on the committee, as such matters pertain to the organization of the congregation and the getting of the Kingdom message preached.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Disfellowshiping Committee:</span><span class="font3"> If all on the congregation committee are brothers and qualify, then the congregation committee becomes at once the disfellowshiping committee.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things&quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2d Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Idolatry (from 1 Cor. 8: 4, 7-10, 13 on page 175 to page 178) Discussion of each subtopic by congregation, under direction of competent chairman. Appropriate questions to stimulate thought should be prepared by the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Incarnation (pages 179 to 181) Discourse by mature brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, sisters appointed to serve as part of the congregation committee will not serve on a disfellowshiping committee. Where conditions exist requiring the attention of this special committee, sisters will step aside and the qualified male brother (s) on the committee will select other qualified brothers associated with the congregation to replace them or will call upon some nearby congregation for mature brothers to fill out the committee, or. under these circumstances, the circuit servant can be called upon to serve on the committee, if it is convenient for him. Appeal can also be made to the Society to appoint some brothers to handle the case and resolve the difficulty, especially where the congregation committee is all sisters. This procedure is necessary, since it appears Scripturally not to be the proper function of a sister to participate in a disfellowshiping procedure and render decisions in connection therewith. A disfellowshiping requires first trial and study of the evidence and decision, and this is the proper responsibility of males. —1 Cor. 6:1-f5, .VW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Therefore, while sisters may serve on the congregation committee where qualified brothers are lacking, at no time will a sister serve on a committee considering a case involving possible disfellowshiping or other action because of misconduct on the part of one in the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>fi</sup> If charges are made against one of the committee, then the other two members of the committee should select a third one, a mature brother fully qualified spiritually, so the matter may bo handled by a committee of three.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Three-Book Offer</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> We would rather associate with Jehovah’s people than with any others. Why? Because we hold in common the same hope. And since it is that common hope that draws us together, when we do meet we talk about that hope and declare it unwaveringly among ourselves.—Heb. 10: 23-25, .YU'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Bui we also want to share out-hope with others. And to share it, we must declare it. A well-prepared three- to eight-minute sermon will do much to inform a householder of your hope. Give it unwaveringly. A confident declaration of your firm hope </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> him may stir hope </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font5"> him. And July's offer of three books and three booklets will help him build on that new hope until he is filled with the true hope.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Caring for Our Whole Assignment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Where do we declare this hope? Throughout all the earth. And while we may speak of some territory as ‘assigned’ and some as ‘unassigned,’ it is actually our assignment, under the Society’s direction, to preach in all of it. July begins our organized effort to work ‘unassigned’ territory. The Society is pleased to report that approximately a thousand congregations made application for unassigned territory. If you, as a congregation or a pioneer, have not yet requested an assignment, do so quickly. Considerable unassigned territory is still available in the following states : Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> If you do have such an assignment, care for it well. When you go there, plan to stay as long as possible. Preach to everyone you meet and witness all the time you are there. The special unassigned territory offer is three books and three booklets on a contribution of $1. One book should be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font5">The other two should be books from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World, </span><span class="font5">available to publishers for this special offer at 20c each. During this campaign we hope to clear this country’s literature rooms of these older books. They have kindled a hope in the hearts of thousands that has remained unwavering all these years. They can do the same today. If some do not take the offer, endeavor to leave some literature with them, a magazine or even a tract. Since they are not regularly visited, we should </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font5"> 4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font5"> J)</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Do you value your privileges and freedom enough to unwaveringly declare your hope in favorable as well as in troublesome season, as Paul admonished Timothy to do? If jou are in position to do so as a pioneer, your energies are urgently needed to gather the hundreds of thousands of other sheep who are still bound by Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Requests regularly come in for pioneers to aid in finding and teaching good-will persons in localities all over the world. You can help to fill these requests and aid others to know Jehovah’s bondage-freeing powers. Increase your joy, service and happiness by becoming a pioneer. Jehovah has lovingly provided this privilege for you. If you do not qualify to be a regular pioneer, then vacation pioneer and build up your ministry in all features, so that you can qualify.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> All of us have aches and pains and troubles of one sort or another. Many have learned that by putting faith and trust in Jehovah he proves to be a soothing salve to all troubles. In fact, by being a source of spiritual health and mental relief to others, our blessings are so numerous that we enjoy relief from our own troubles.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> At the conclusion of most review questions in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font5"> a problem is presented. The brother who delivered the instruction talk will handle the review questions and then the problem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The school servant should use discernment in making instruction talk assignments, keeping in mind the ability of the brothers in relationship to the material in the lesson. He will make suggestions to the speaker in advance of his talk as to how the problem is to be treated. Then, in the conclusion of the instruction talk, the speaker can call attention to the problem for consideration the following week and ad-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Assembly Time Nears</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The many assemblies strategically located throughout the United States make it easy for all to attend this year. So there is no question about our being there. But w’hat about your detailed plans? Are you bringing a carload? Are you bringing newly interested persons? Have you turned in your volunteer service slip? Have you mailed your room request form to the convention city where you will attend? Are your vacation plans completed so they coincide with the assembly dates? Is this true even if you live in the convention city or nearby so you can attend for all four days? Have the lapel cards and badges for your congregation been ordered? Are you prepared </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Let Us Go On to the House of Jehovah</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> In Psalm 122:1, 2 the psalmist thrills at the opportunity of entering Jehovah’s house. Jerusalem, Jehovah’s organization, was very dear to him, for there Jehovah commanded his blessing, even life, forevermore. (Ps. 133:3) This foreshadows the proper attitude of all those coming to a clear knowledge of Jehovah and his glorious arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> There is only one entrance to Jehovah's organization. That is by dedication to Jehovah God through Christ Jesus. (John 10:7-9) Jehovah commands that such dedication be symbolized by water baptism. (Matt. 28 :19) No ope else can alter, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3. col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting Places</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tn most parts of the world we are privileged to gather openly at Kingdom Halls. However, this Is not true of brothers behind the iron curtain and in some other countries. However, assemble the brothers do, for they well know the value of meetings. Under adverse conditions 81.2 percent of the brothers in Argentina (80) attend the &quot;Watchtower&quot; study. And very happy indeed are all of us to know the brothers in Taiwan (193) are now able to assemble openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kingdom Halls provide a place for us to meet together and also serve as a witness to the community. In Guam (74, 75) when the first Kingdom Hall was opened it attracted much attention, even that of the priests, who helped advertise it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In China (115, 116) meeting attendance increased to the point where Kingdom Hall facilities were inadequate. When efforts to obtain a larger hall failed, other convenient arrangements were worked out for brothers and good-will persons to attend comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A friendly, warm spirit should prevail at all meetings and brothers should be alert to welcome newly interested persons. Note the Guatemala (167) report in this regard and the fruitage of Christian hospitality manifested in the Philippines. (243) A visitor in Singapore (257) was so impressed he ■wanted to know our secret formula for happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Does a friendly, warm spirit prevail at your Kingdom Hall? Undoubtedly it does, for it should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly Time Nears </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">to share in field service in the convention city? These and other details of convention preparation should be given attention and reviewed so all will be in readiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> For the benefit of the new ones desiring to symbolize their dedication by water immersion, we are happy to advise that such arrangements are being made at each assembly city. Each candidate should bring his own bathing suit and towel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> When Jehovah’s witnesses meet in assembly they are under scrutiny by many persons of good will and interested persons, the curious and many others of the world. The good decorum of the witnesses at conventions has received many favorable comments. In fact, the New York Natural Hygiene Society in a bulletin to their people used us as a model: “Let us show the world that we can be as ably disciplined as the witnesses of Jehovah, the best example of this nature anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> We want to maintain this good reputation, but of even more importance we want Jehovah’s approval and to gain the most we can from the assembly. Here are a few goodconduct points to keep in mind: While attending sessions, listen ; do not converse with others to the annoyance of those nearby. Take notes for your own use and in order to be</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Improving Your Sermons</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> To give an effective witness brings joy to the hearts of Jehovah’s servants. Sticking to one subject, developing it properly and delivering it enthusiastically results in a convincing message. Just as the rudder sets the navigational course, so sticking to a definite theme enables us to accomplish our goal, namely, to give a coherent sermon and impress good-will persons with the truth that we present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In everyday conversation have you ever heard persons who start to talk on one thing, never finish what they begin and then get clear off on another subject? To say the least it is inconsistent and disturbing, isn’t it? And when you stop and reflect on the matter, what is it that makes for effective conversation and argumentation? Is it not having an objective in mind and then in an orderly manner proceeding to develop your points toward a successful climax? This necessitates having a theme. Yet this weakness on the part of some results in ineffective sermons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Yes, one of the essential requirements for convincing sermons is simply sticking to a theme. This means we must develop one central thought throughout. How can this be done? By the repetition of key words and phrases. For example, consider the “Kingdom” sermon in the January able to share information with those who could not attend. Be at the meeting before it starts, thereby eliminating confusion caused by latecomers. Do not leave the meeting early to avoid the crowd or to be first at the cafeteria, for this does not justify the disturbance to others. Have your children alongside you at meetings. Do not walk up and down the corridors while the sessions are in progress, for this shows lack of appreciation for the spiritual food being served. It would be well for a mature brother to give a service meeting talk on assembly conduct a week or so before your assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The assembly will be the most important period of time on your theocratic agenda this summer. How could it be anything else but of highest personal interest w’ith such a climactic subject for the public meeting as “Why Permanent Peace Will Come in Our Day”? Be sure to attend your district assembly all four days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font5"> It is suggested that we use this sermon wfith our offer for this month, particularly in unassigned territory and in portions of our regular territory not recently covered. First of all, notice that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> theme is set by the opening scripture, Matthew 6:10. Next, we learn that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> is a real government and that it will destroy wicked rule. Then </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> blessings are highlighted and finally the literature emphasizing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font5">as the only hope is introduced. Note, also, the logical order in which these points are presented so the listener will not have difficulty following the theme and arriving at a proper understanding of what you are trying to convey. Hence by fully preparing our material and stressing the main point we can present better sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Remember, too. in many ways a sermon is like a public talk. Before actual delivery in the field, rehearse it before a companion or a friend. After giving the sermon, see if he can clearly tell you what you are trying to impart to the householder. If your theme is properly developed, it will be obvious and you will have overcome another sermon weakness. </span><span class="font2">[Swffestfwits </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">for handling this part:</span><span class="font2"> Under the direction of one of the more mature brothers In the congregation, arrange to discuss and develop the &quot;Kingdom” sermon, displaying it before the congregation by means of a blackboard or a chart </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pay </span><span class="font2">particular attention to highlighting the theme and analyze how both the publisher and householder will benefit by having the theme properly developed.}</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">School Review Problems </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">vise the audience as to how it will be handled. Some problems will require that the audience prepare ahead and present examples or suggestions for coping with certain situations. Other problems call for demonstrations. The instruction talk speaker will prepare and present demonstrations as if for the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> When a problem is handled, the five minutes allotted to audience participation following the Bible reading will be used. Otherwise, audience participation will continue at the end of the Bible reading. Careful preparation will be needed for these presentations, both by the speaker and the audience, in order to make the best use of the five minutes. Details can be eliminated in demonstrations, except where they are needed to put across particular points as required. Problems for the individual publisher, such as the ones based on Study 36, can be discussed by the speaker and suggestions can be received from the audience.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Aiding Interested Persons in Unassigned Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Chairman: Use material in Studies 38, 53-57 of &quot;Qualified to Be Ministers.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chairman (3 min.) Most will be accomplished in unassigned territory and isolated parts of regular territory this summer if publishers give special attention to subscribers and/or isolated publishers, instructing these persons on how to take an active part in the preaching work. They should be built up spiritually and organized for future service. We should call to ascertain interest and understanding, introducing ourselves with a sermon showing the value of knowledge and association with the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE I (10 min.) (Pantomime and narration for following skits)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Publisher meets subscriber who has had no contact with organization. Publisher finds him interested so shows him how to get most from literature and Bible reading through studying. Arranges for Bible study while in territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. Publisher meets subscriber who is familiar with organization, has attended meetings, but does not publish. Publisher encourages association, talks about work being done, invites him to share in meetings, suggests his talking to neighbors and friends about truth. Arranges for return discussions for better understanding of organization and to take him along in preaching activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Publisher meets untrained isolated publisher who does little preaching. Publisher tells of group working territory during summer and invites him to share. Displays January &quot;Informant,” points out &quot;Kingdom” sermon and helps isolated brother prepare it. Shows how sermon will help him call on people in community. Encourages</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. . . House of Jehovah </span><span class="font5">(Coni’d) amend or otherwise neutralize this requirement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Despite this very clear and definite direction from Jehovah, there seems to be an impression in the minds of some that, although dedication is mandatory, baptism is discretionary and is only necessary if and when an individual is so inclined. This is actually a delusion of the adversary. There is only one way to life. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> All must follow in the pathway Jesus blazed and directed for his followers. Any other course is a refusal to follow through on the covenant of dedication that is made by obediently taking the next step of immersion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Everyone who has made a dedication to Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, our Lord, should symbolize that dedication by water immersion and do it as soon as possible.—Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 9:18; 22:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The district assemblies this summer will provide an excellent opportunity to take the vital step of baptism following dedication. The matter will, of course, be covered in the service meeting when this article is considered. However, in addition </span><span class="font3">regular, systematic house-to-house and back-call work. Will help during summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (5 min.) </span><span class="font3">Starting new ones in service is only beginning. Work with them to enable these immature ones to stand on their own feet by end of summer. Help them prepare house-to-house and back-call sermons and take them along in service for practical training in the ministry. Also, discuss the &quot;Informant” with them. Let them see its practical assistance to them, encouraging them to use its ideas. Rapid progress can be made if we use our time wisely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (5 min.) </span><span class="font3">End of summer work near, publisher and good-will person discuss how good-will person will carry on preaching work as isolated publisher. Congregation will advise the Society of his name and address so copies of the &quot;Informant” for the group may be sent to him each month. Group meetings will be held in convenient home for benefit of others of good will contacted while in the territory. Publisher will not forget him, but will keep in contact by letter to answer questions good-will person may have and to further incite isolated ones to right works. Also, when possible, visits will be made on him to give more field service instruction. Goodwill person, now active isolated publisher, grateful for assistance given during summer and arrangements made for future aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (2 min.) </span><span class="font3">Unassigned territory work to be very seriously handled and well organized to give isolated good-will persons the most benefit from our work. Consider that our building up these new and weak ones may be the means of their being gathered into the New World society, to their eternal blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">congregation book study conductors and home Bible study conductors should make the matter clear to any who do not attend the service meeting, and encourage them to attend an assembly. Those persons who have made a dedication should be helped to see that if they have not taken the second step of symbolizing it by water immersion they have not completed it. The public declaration of their dedication by water immersion before witnesses is necessary in order to complete the dedication.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s direction to Saul of Tarsus through Ananias is worth considering: “And now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized.” (Acts 22:16) Similarly the Ethiopian eunuch expressed the right thought when he said to Philip: “Look I a body of water; what prevents me from getting baptized Acts 8: 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The great crisis of Armageddon is impending. Those who are going to have Jehovah’s preservation and protection are those who have availed themselves of his provision by entering into his sheepfold through the door by means of dedication and baptism. (Zeph. 2:2, 3) This is no time to halt between two opinions. If Jehovah is God, serve him.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The most fragrant aroma is that of the knowledge of God. Not only is it pleasing but it leads to life! New World society members realize this, and by word of mouth and Bible literature they spread this fragrance. (2 Cor. 2:14, A IF) A great amount of knowledge of God has already been made perceptible in this way and more remains to be done! Surely all of us want to increase our share in making the fragrance of the knowledge of God perceptible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- Throughout August Jehovah’s servants will diffuse the fragrant knowledge of God to many more thousands by continuing to offer three books and three booklets in assigned and unassigned territory.

<p><span class="font5"><sup>x</sup>As in all that we do. we should plan rural witnessing in order to make our time count. In making up car groups for working rurals, no more should be assigned to a car than can be kept busy most of the time contacting people with the Kingdom message. If territory is sparcely settled, with houses far apart, only two or three people should be assigned to a car, otherwise much time will be lost by publishers waiting for other publishers who are witnessing. (See paragraph 18 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity.) </span><span class="font5">Other rural areas will have more thickly populated areas and these will accommodate more publishers. Some rurals have small settlements and villages where three or four of the stronger and more energetic publishers can be let off with a supply of literature and they can work such territory by walking. Definite arrangements should be made to pick up these publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It can readily be seen that successful rural witnessing depends much upon proper planning by the study conductor and car driver. The route to be followed should be studied out and discernment will need to be used in determining the best way to assign publishers to work houses ahead. If </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> house is far removed from other houses, to save traveling the group can wait until the publisher returns from the house. In this case the publisher should make his witness brief but thorough. Usually the driver will be able to distribute publishers and then he can take a house. He will he careful to make his calls brief so he will not keep the others waiting. When leaving a publisher it is best to wait a minute or</span></p>

If the supply at the assembly you attend runs out, then congregations may submit orders to the Society at the same price, namely, 20c a copy.</span></p>

<p><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup><a name="bookmark29"></a></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup></sup> In covering unassigned territory this summer the above suggestions can be utilized. If several trips are made to this territory, back-calls can be made and studies started. In covering rural assignments of the congregation, definite arrangements should be made to follow up the interest with back-calls and home Bible studies. This will require a proper record of interest manifested. Road numbers, landmarks, description of house, etc., can be used to locate back-calls accurately. The car driver should plan to return to the territory worked a week or so before and make it possible for publishers to make back-calls where literature was placed. Then on returning home a different road might be traveled where other back-calls can be made. All this activity will require co-operation and wise use of the time. When rurals are worked, plan to take a lunch and spend long hours witnessing.</span></p>

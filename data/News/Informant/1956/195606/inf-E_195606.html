<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>March and April Peak Magazine Months</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> On compiling April publisher reports the figure rose to 185,011), with 924 congregations reporting “We Made It I” That represents a 12.9-per-cent increase over last year’s average publishers, but a drop below last April’s peak publishers of 187,120. While this is short of the 20-percent goal of 196,650 publishers and is the first time in four years we could not report “We Made It!” nevertheless we have cause to be glad and rejoice. Why so ? Because the 12.9-percent increase represents thousands of new praisers gathered to the New World society. For this we give thanks to Jehovah knowing lie gives the increase as it pleases him. We hope all these will become regular publishers now for the remaining months of this service year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Greatest Magazine Months</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> You wall be glad to know that March and April were the greatest magazine months on record. During these two months 5,956,678 magazines were placed, against 3,414,557 last March and April. That is over 2| million more! A 74.7-percent increase ! That is wonderful for the two-month campaign. It was a pleasure for the Society to supply your requirements and we know your joys in<sup>-</sup> placing the magazines were numerous. Experiences coming from the field readily verify this fact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The 19th annual </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer </span><span class="font5">campaign was the greatest of all. Last year we obtained 353,492 new subscriptions, uhereas this year the number rose to 408,540. Yes 55,048 more new subscriptions. Very good, indeed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Thus, while we did not make our 20-percent increase, we are thankful to Jehovah for the 12.9-percent publisher increase and the other fine increases in our report. Without letup we shall faithfully continue to praise Jehovah and advance Kingdom interests, “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15: 58, .VTT.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">WORK ALL TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Under the direction of the enthroned King, Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in warfare. Without any letup we must “fight . . . against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” As emphasized in the February 15, 1956, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” must be used effectively if we are to triumph over wicked spirit forces.—Eph. 6: 12, 17, NW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Theocratic soldiers, are you prepared for the battle? Are you ready to assist all the good-will persons that you possibly can to resist the wicked forces and gain life? Then march forward in the confidence of Jehovah. During June endeavor to complete coverage of all territory not yet served with the offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”,</span><span class="font5"> Offer them on a contribution of 50c. If the offer is not accepted, try to place the booklet and a magazine on a 10c contribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> June evenings are so pleasant it is suggested that all arrange to be out in service after supper and before the congregation book study, offering from house to house the two magazines on earth that expose the wicked spirit forces, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> Aid and encourage new publishers to go out with you. It Is an excellent way to assist new ones regularly to share in magazine distribution and for publishers who cannot support regular Magazine Day service to meet their quota of nine magazines a month.</span></p></li>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A NEW FILM</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> With great pleasure the Society announces the release of a new film entitled “The Happiness of the New World Society.” Starting June 15, 1956, it will be shown at all circuit assemblies on Saturday evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> What is the new film about? Rather than tell you now, we say be sure to attend your circuit assembly and see for yourself. And be sure to bring with you persons of good will. They too will enjoy it and will be deeply impressed, for this film was prepared with their interests in mind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup> Until further notice the new film will be shown only at circuit assemblies on Saturday night. As heretofore, congregations may request and circuit servants will arrange local showings of “The New World Society in Action” during the two-week period in which the district servant serves a circuit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Wicked Forces Defeated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only a wicked person would want to rob good-will persons of the seed of God’s Word instead of cultivating it in their hearts. Luke's account (Luke 8: 12) exposes the Devil as the one who schemes to take away the seed. He sends out his ‘birds,’ whether they are invisible demons who work at the mind or are men and women who attack and oppose the truth. Note the following interesting accounts and how the wicked forces were defeated by proper use of God’s Word and by the power of his spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Ceylon (111) a Salvation Army captain tried to bias the mind of a good-will woman who had had only a few studies. However, she had become strengthened to the point of not only withstanding the wicked assault but of being able to teach the attacker some Bible truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Communists' hate for Jehovah and his people causes them to continue persecuting our brothers in Czechoslovakia (124-126) and other sections behind the iron curtain. Some former brothers have become tools of Satan and this has not helped our faithful brothers. But, to be sure, Jehovah is cognizant of their faithful service and the gathering work goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The preaching work is just starting in Eritrea. (142) However, after a ‘showdown’ called for by a false shepherd, one of his students saw Jehovah’s witnesses were the ones who properly used the Sword and refused to let the robber bird take away the seed that had been planted in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wicked forces cannot withstand Bible truth or defend their position. By skillfully wielding the Sword under adverse conditions a circuit servant in Venezuela (284, 285) had some blessed experiences. Also see Malta. (105)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Make Sure of All Things’’ has proved to be a ready means to wield the Sword effectively, even by newly interested persons, as shown in the Dominican report on page 204. Do your part to defeat wicked forces and drive away the ‘birds’ of false religion by calling back promptly and skillfully wielding the Sword of the spirit.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Have You Made Convention Plans?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup>This title does not mean, have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font5">decided to go, but rather where; and have you prepared your room request for mailing? Included too is the filling out of your Volunteer Service form, because you will want to serve your brothers while in attendance at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It is important that we attend to share all the rich blessings that Jehovah so liberally pours out for us from the windows of heaven, for our spiritual sustenance. Of course, benefits are derived only when we are there to receive and digest them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Frequently we hear of exceptional field experiences enjoyed at the convention city. Have you had this satisfaction? To share these experiences it is necessary to participate in field service and take advantage of all opportunities to talk to persons that have a listening ear.

<p><span class="font9">THE GOOD MEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Improving Your Sermons</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">(Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Constant improvement in the ministry is the goal of all of Jehovah’s people. It is an evidence of growth to maturity. In this same vein Paul wrote: “Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:15, A’lF) Do you constantly seek to improve the quality of your sermons? Here are some common sermon weaknesses and suggestions to overcome them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Improving Conversational Quality: It is good to be friendly with the people. Look them in the eye as you speak to them, get their reactions ; see if what you are saying to them is registering or vrhether you need to change your presentation. It is best to talk </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font5"> them and not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font5">them. By the occasional use of well-selected positive questions you can tactfully draw out the householder and yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">still control the situation. </span><span class="font5">For example: “We can certainly see how conditions are going from bad to worse, can’t we?” Another could be: “When we consider the growing world delinquency, we wonder what will occur next, isn't that true?” To these queries most householders would give a positive answer. Such will help to align their thinking with yours, stimulate thought and generally make for a better conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tunities are unending, because generally there is good publicity, and people are aware of an unusal event taking place. Their curiosity will be aroused and they will want to know what it is all about. Therein lies an additional opening to convey to such people the life-giving truths. So place field service at the top of your agenda of the things you want to do while at the convention this summer, as well as while traveling en route to the convention city and returning home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Film &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Society” on Saturday night, the circuit activity meeting featuring a specially arranged Society program, which has been so much appreciated by the brothers everywhere, will replace the service meeting and ministry school on Friday night. It is a program you will not want to miss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Plan now to attend all three days of your coming circuit assembly and bring persons of good will with you. We are confident you will be richly rewarded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Improving Transitions to the Literature Offer: This is where many publishers need help. We may have a good sermon and deliver it well but find it difficult to bridge the gap to the literature offer. For example, if you have been using the Armageddon sermon in the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font5">you might say this: “Talking about Armageddon and how to survive it is indeed an interesting subject. You may wonder just where I obtained this information. Actually, it was taken from this Bible study aid </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World.”</span><span class="font5"> Then refer to a specific point, illustrate the wisdom of taking in the right kind of knowledge and how it will lead to life. Another transitional phrase could be this: “No doubt you would like to further your Christian convictions in these critical days when faith is being sorely tested. I’ve found this publication very helpful in that regard and here is a particular point I should like to share with you.” Then tie in a specific reference to the sermon being used and make the offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Sermon improvement is largely a matter of analyzing and then overcoming one’s weaknesses. Make your advancement manifest to all persons by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">progressively improving your sermons.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[Suggestions for handling this part:</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> A capable study conductor may give a talk embodying the above-mentioned points and use publishers to demonstrate ways of overcoming sermon weaknesses as points are developed,]</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>PUBLIC RELATIONS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">New public relations material is being sent to all congregations with the June </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font5"> This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Manual of Theocratic News Service Information</span><span class="font5"> should be made a part of the congregation’s permanent file. Copies of the manual have already been sent to district, circuit and circuit public relations servants. They, as well as congregation servants and those assisting them in public relations work, should read it carefully and then try to apply the suggestions in their own particular field. It is intended that the congregations especially should make an effort to expand their opportunities of publicizing the Kingdom work. Many local activities can be used to gain publicity for the work, and if congregation servants become acquainted with the requirements in this special field, much can be done to keep Jehovah’s name before the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">[To be developed by the congregation in discussion under the supervision of the school servant.

<p><span class="font3">School Servant (2 min.) During May and June many thousands of ‘‘You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World” and “This Good News of the Kingdom.” will be placed with persons after they hear the 3- to 8-minute sermon on Armageddon. To cultivate the interest we must call back to study with them and help them become a part of the New World society, as forcefully brought to our attention on page 366 of &quot;You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World.” This requires preparing and using effective back-call sermons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Talk by competent brother covering definition and origin, God’s opposition to interfaith, leads to disaster, Jesus did not advocate separate religious organizations but condemned them, Christians resist interfaith because it is not Scriptural, erroneous to believe all roads lead to same place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah (pages 188 to 193)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Discussion of subtopics by congregation under chairman, who asks questions requiring Scriptural answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Checking Our Magazine Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chairman (5 min.) (Publisher's Record cards should be distributed before the meeting.) Magazine distribution is accomplishing a big; work. “The Watchtower” is the one journal in the world devoted exclusively to announcing the Kingdom. &quot;Awake!” equips Jehovah’s ministers so they have a broad knowledge and can speak to persons of all walks of life, and at the same time it shows those people the need of a new world and draws them into contact with the New World society, where they can learn the truth. In 1953, 25,-115,729 individual copies of these magazines were distributed, in 1954 there were 29,937,614 and in 1955, in addition to the more than one million new subscriptions obtained, 36,500,383 individual copies were distributed. That is a 45-percent increase in just two years! Compare the figures for the same time period on the local congregation report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Point out how many magazines are received each month by the congregation and then compare that number with those placed by the congregation as a whole. Were they all placed? Where are the others? Ask each publisher to check his own card. How many of each issue do you receive? How many would that make for the month? Did you place them all? The answer to the problem is not to cut the order but to increase efficiency. By enthusiastically sharing in magazine distribution many are regularly exceeding their quota. Does your card show you have averaged 9 or more magazines each month? Does the congregation average 9 per publisher per month?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Congregation (8 min.) The entire congregation will share in offering suggestions for Increasing distribution. First, have one or two good experiences on the results that have come from magazine distribution locally. Next, ask the publishers to tell all the different ways in which they have ever placed magazines, either in regular features’ of the service or incidental preaching. Then ask for further suggestions on opportunities to place the magazines. (There are good suggestions in the “Informant” issues of May and November, 1955, and in “Qualified to Be Ministers,” pages 183 and 187.) Ask the publishers to write down the suggestions as they are made. Now, which suggestions on the list can we personally use to increase our magazine distribution?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conclusion (2 min.) Stress again the need for a regular day each week when we share in magazine distribution. Urge every publisher to be sure to offer the two latest magazines at every door where the regular offer is not placed. Let us all take advantage of the many other opportunities we have in everyday contacts with others to place these two vital magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Before going on to the next part of the meeting, ask the publishers to pass their Publisher’s Record cards to the aisle, where the assistant congregation servant will collect them,]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We still have a supply of the 1956 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> Undoubtedly many newly interested persons would like a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> so as to consider the daily text and to read world-wide witnessing reports. Congregations should order as many of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> as they need right now. Our supply of 1956 calendars has been exhausted.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The time is almost here! What time? The time for thousands of young ministers of school age and many older ministers to vacation pioneer. Have you tilled out your application and given it to the congregation servant for the committee’s recommendation and forwarding to the Society ? If not, do so right away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Kingdom work is the prime career or life work for every servant of Jehovah. All who qualify and can should be in the regular pioneer service. Those who cannot pioneer full time should have as their goal vacation pioneering some time every year. Do you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In addition to enjoying the blessed experiences of vacation pioneering, many happy pioneers of today found the vacation pioneer service to be the steppingstone to full-time service. More than a few of such now serve as members of the Bethel family, circuit servants, special pioneers and missionaries in foreign fields.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> If obligations will not permit you to be a regular pioneer, then be a vacation pioneer. It is not too late yet to do so this summer. Will you be in the pioneer ranks?</span></p></li></ul>

And, of all importance, conduct your back-calls in such a way as to start and continue home Bible studies with them. That many of us should be more active in back-call and Bible study work is apparent from the congregation organization article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup> Desiring to wield the sword against wicked spiritual forces as much as possible throughout the summer, when we are able to devote more time to the service, we should arrange long days of field work during the week as well as on Saturday and Sunday. Take a lunch along so you do not have to return home between morning house-to-house service and afternoon back-call and home Bible study service or additional house-to-house work with the oiler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> The wicked spirit forces will try to retard our ministry; that we know. But they will never succeed. Triumphant under the direction of our victorious King we shall ever make it our determination to move forward, using the Sword of the spirit to clear the way for ourselves and persons of good will to survive Armageddon and live forever in Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society’s offices, factory and Bethel home in Brooklyn, New York, will be closed from August 4 to 19 inclusive. Orders and correspondence sent in during that period will not be handled until some time after the reopening of the offices. Please anticipate your needs and place your orders in ample time for attention before the vacation period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> a letter is being sent to all congregation servants giving instructions for contacting all radio stations in the territory held by the congregation, in an effort to secure </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">free radio time</span><span class="font5"> for the program “Things People Are Thinking About.” Local brothers who are capable and the public relations servant may be called upon to assist. A sample radio script is also being sent. If additional scripts are required they may be obtained upon request to the Society. Careful consideration of this material and preparation for these contacts will undoubtedly result in many more radio openings to spread the good news.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Increasing Back-Call and Bible Study Work</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> In the November, 1954, and the September, 1955, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> the Society published a country-wide spot and sectional analysis of general field service activity. The data compiled revealed an urgent need for greater publisher participation in the back-call and Bible study service. Practical suggestions were also given to bring about immediate improvement in these features of service. How have we been doing since then? Just what are the facts at the present time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> During the last six months an average of 82 percent of the total publishers shared in house-to-house preaching, 60.9 percent made back-calls and 31.1 percent conducted Bible studies. How does this compare with the figures outlined in the November and the September </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informa nt:t</span><span class="font5"> Steady progress and increase in the number of publishers sharing in house-to-house preaching is again noted. The same, however, cannot be said of the back-call and Bible study work. Many publishers continue to share irregularly in these two features of service and only a minority carry the bulk of the load in the Bible study activity.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Prepare for Unassigned Territory Work</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has made loving provision for his servants by instructing them to assemble together. By commenting in meetings we actually speak to one another of our hope. We need this participation, for it builds up spiritually and equips us to express ourselves in the ministry. —Heb. 10: 23-25, W.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> During July, August and September we may share in unassigned territory ministry. Have you submitted an application? Are, you fully prepared? Meetings must be included in our preparation. Public talks should be scheduled wherever posi-ble. Regular study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> should follow. If no public meetings can be arranged for, be sure to hold the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, with a mature publisher acting as conductor, even if it involves only a car group or two in the isolated assignment. But in this campaign try to locate interested people and make it convenient for them to join in meetings with you. Encourage them</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Should we become disheartened and discouraged, perhaps feeling that progress cannot be made in these avenues of service? No, this would not be a constructive way of analyzing our ministry. Sober reflection is good for the heart and mind. Individually, therefore, let us examine our worship and see where we have fallen short and wherein we can improve to a greater extent</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Each month millions upon millions of pieces of literature are being placed with as many people. It is apparent, therefore, that we do not seem to be having any difficulty or lack of ability in placing literature, laying the foundation for follow-up activity. Wherein, then, does our problem He? Generally, it appears that we have not been as thorough in applying ourselves in the watering and cultivating work as in planting the seed of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> After taking close stock of our personal ministerial activity (1) have you regularly used the house-to-house record form and noted all placements made? (2) Are you consistent in supporting midweek and Sunday back-call arrangements? (3) How do you prepare yourself for this work? (4) Are you using and delivering effective ten- to fifteen-minute ser-to continue the meetings after the campaign has ended.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The special unassigned territory offer is any two books, from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font5"> New </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World, </span><span class="font5">along with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> and three booklets for $1. Congregations with a surplus of older books should contact other congregations and arrange transfers of stock. (See the letter of March 20,1956, for details.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Congregations having territory not worked within the last six months, especially rural areas, may use this special offer in such territory. In all other territories the regular offer of three books and three booklets for $3.50 will be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Share in meetings wherever you may be this summer and incite others to love and right works by unwaveringly declaring our hope.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The Society has continued to stress the need for greater effectiveness and participation in these two vital forms of service at circuit assemblies. Fine expressions have been received from brothers seeing and appreciating the present program. If you have not had your assembly as yet, plan to be there and assist others to get there also. Those who have already had their circuit assembly are now in an excellent position to apply the suggestion given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Back-call service and Bible study work are two of the most joyful activities in which we engage. Seeing the great need, let all of us increase our back-call and home Bible study activity. It will result in more of the other sheep’s being properly fed and nourished in the way of life.</span></p></li></ul>

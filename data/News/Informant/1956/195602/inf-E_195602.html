<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Special Campaign Arranged for March and April</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Last year the April campaign with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”!</span><span class="font3"> was a tremendous success. In April alone over 3,700,000 copies were placed in the United States, and many new peaks and tine increases were reached. It was indeed one of the biggest single witnesses given to date and its wide distribution throughout the world was a devastating blow to Christendom’s claim of being the light of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> This year another great witness will be given. How? Through the distribution of the April I, 1956, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which will contain a special article for the public and one on communism, a true story, and other material. This issue will be released for the Memorial week end. You may use it beginning March 21. From that date on there will be an intensive distribution of it in a special campaign, and this distribution will continue until your entire supply is exhausted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> What is our goal of magazines to be distributed? Double the total number placed during April, 1955. Our magazine placements nationwide last April exceeded any other month of the year. Therefore, each congregation and all regular and special pioneers should have as their goal for April, 1956, the doubling of the number of magazines placed in April, 1955.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Each congregation servant will check the 1955 Progressive Record sheet to see how many magazines the congregation placed in April, 1955, and then send in a special magazine order for at least that number of the April </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> plus the additional number required for pioneers. This special order is over and above the regular magazine order. For example, the Cleveland, Ohio, East Side Unit reported that ninety-six publishers placed 1,091 magazines last April. Thus the congregation servant will place a special order for at least 1,091 extra copies of the April 1, 1956, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for congregation publishers, plus the additional number desired by pioneers. The special order is, of course, in addition to your regular order of magazines. which will include your regular supply of the April 1 issue, which will be sent as usual.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> With all congregations and pioneers doubling the number of magazines placed last April, a grand total of over 3,500,000 magazines will be placed. What a tremendous witness will be given ! Last April we placed over 3,700,000 booklets and, in addition, 1,761,874 magazines. Is it not likely, then, that this year, with each one’s putting forth a special effort upon which we can anticipate Jehovah’s blessing, we shall place over 3,500,000 magazines in the United States in April? We believe so, and here at the Society’s headquarters we shall work diligently to supply all field service needs, knowing that a wide distribution of the special April 1 issue will result in exalting Jehovah's name. Certainly this will be the time, from March 21 through April, to make a diligent effort to get all new and irregular publishers into the field service with the magazines, along with the regular publishers in your congregation. If it should happen that some congregations still have a supply of the April 1 issue on hand when the April 8 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> or April 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is released they can easily exhaust their supply by offering the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> together with either of these issues on a ten-cent contribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> This advanced information is given to enable every congregation, pioneer and isolated publisher to plan your work and order adequate magazines for this campaign, which, undoubtedly, will be the greatest distribution of any single issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine to date. It is vitally important that your orders be figured out right away and submitted to the Society no later than March 1, 1956. On the basis of orders received the Society will print the required number of the April 1 issue. Ascertain the number of this special issue you desire and send in your order right away. A magazine order blank is enclosed for your convenience. Detailed instructions for using this special issue will appear in next month’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Do you have the same joy in working that Jesus had? He said: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.&quot; More and more the trend in the present system of things is to give grudgingly and take little pride in constructive work accomplished. To have a wealth of good works means more than all the riches in this world, for it means treasure in the heavens. It means real security, for Jehovah does not forget good works.—John 5:17; 1 Tim. 6:18 ; Heb. 6:10, 11, W.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The most important work assigned Jehovah's dedicated servants in this time of the end is the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. What better way is there to show a wealth of good works during February than by offering subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower !</span><span class="font3"> Of course, each publisher will prepare ahead of time to present the subscription ef-</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Magazine Placements Up</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Pioneers and congregation publishers, we are very glad to relate the good news : your magazine placements are up and continue to increase. The first month that congregation publishers reached their quota of nine magazines was October, averaging 9.3. In November the average went to 9.4 and jumped in December to 11.5. Very good indeed!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Special pioneers have done well too. They averaged 64.8 last year, went up to an average of 90.8 in November and over their quota of 110 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col,</span><span class="font3"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ready to Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The apostle Paul counseled Timothy ‘*to be rich in right works, . . . ready to share.” (1 Tim. 6: 17, 18, NW) As shown in the 1956 &quot;Yearbook,” all of Jehovah’s witnesses are ever ready, willing and desirous of sharing the allimportant Kingdom message with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is well illustrated by publishers in Okinawa. The pioneers report that they found so much interest they could not be content with minimum service and ended the service year averaging over 148 hours each. (192) And what can publishers do when in a foreign country where a different language than theirs is spoken? Why, learn to give sermons in the language of the country! And regardless of where one might be he should share the message with others. A brother undergoing treatment in a leper colony in Nigeria preached and before the time came for nis discharge he was privileged to help fourteen to learn the truth and be baptized. Now the good work can continue there. (221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When in Rome Paul suffered because of his faithfulness. Today some of Jehovah's people in Italy are subjected to punishment, even literal beatings. A 22-year-old sister was furiously beaten by her mother with a rolling pin because she attended an assembly. Did it break her down? No, she was determined even more to show a wealth of good works by serving Jehovah steadfastly. (186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wrote a 71-year-old sister in France, completely isolated and new in the truth: &quot;How grateful I am to Jehovah! I am very happy Indeed. This is the second person I have found who is seriously interested. What a pity I am so old!” Old in years, yes, but by no means does this slow her down from showing a wealth of good works. (146)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THINKING ABOUT IT?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> ‘It’s time that I stopped </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thinking </span><span class="font3">about it and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font3"> something about it!’ a publisher wrote in recently. ‘Please send me a pioneer application as soon as possible I’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; What about you? Are you still “thinking about it”? Why wait? Does not Jehovah promise the necessities of life? “This good news of the kingdom” must now be preached! Examine yourself and ask, What is holding me back from telling others this good news full time?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Rather than serving God with whole mind and strength this sad old world’s whole mind and strength are bent on serving selfish interests and pleasing the flesh. But not so with true Christians ’ They know that the greatest joy comes by thinking and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">talking</span><span class="font3"> about the blessings of Jehovah’s kingdom, and that this joy is multiplied beyond measure when in the full-time service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Are you just thinking about it? Why not do something about it —now! Make room for the untold happiness that awaits you by writing for an application for the pioneer service right away.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> February is a month of extremely cold weather for many parts of the country. But whether the weather is cold or warm where Jehovah’s witnesses live, throughout the month all will show a wealth of good works by diligently continuing their house-to-house search to locate other sheep interested in living forever on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Are you using an effective sermon that produces results? If so, and if you have not completely worked your territory using it, then you are well prepared to continue service this month. If your sermon has not been effective or you are in need of a new one, you might try the following, which has been used very successfully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Introduction:</span><span class="font3"> ‘Good morning. I am calling in a ministerial service looking for persons who would like to live forever on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">earth.</span><span class="font3"> [Try for an invitation into home if circumstances make it advisable.] That might sound strange to you, because ordinarily we are told that we shall go to heaven if we are good or to the hot place if we are bad, but have you ever contemplated living forever on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Placements Up </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd} </span><span class="font3">in December by averaging 111,3. Pioneers, too, are making fine progress and with the reduced magazine rate now in effect for them undoubtedly before long regular pioneers will reach their quota of 90. Last year regular pioneers averaged 55.2 magazines a month, while in November it was up to 71.3 and in December 83.3. That is getting closer to the 90 quota. Circuit and district servants also had excellent reports, averaging 106 in November and 125.7 in December. Keep up the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Holiday Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> More publishers were out this “Thanksgiving” and “Christmas” than any other year. A grand time was had by all. The many excellent reports received relate that people were receptive, placements were good and an excellent witness was given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Virtually all congregations reported outstanding placements both days. One wrote: “A carload of four publishers placed 362 magazines (an average of 90 each).” Another: “We wish to report the special Magazine Day was highly successful, with a peak in magazines placed in one day and also with a peak of publishers out. Twenty-seven publishers placed 535 magazines.” One New York city the earth? It is interesting to consider what the Bible has to say about this.’</span></p></li></ul>

To aid us to obtain this vital information the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine is published. Note right here on the cover that the very purpose of it is to announce Jehovah's kingdom. Looking into the magazine, here on page 67, paragraph 4, you see it points out . . .’ (Use first question of “Check Your Memory,” February 1 issue, to lead householder into magazine, and in conclusion make subscription offer.) unit placed over 1,400 magazines on December 25.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">Undoubtedly all of Jehovah’s witnesses who are noncitizens have already gone to the nearest post office or immigration office and filled out an address report card, in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act; but, if not, they should do so before the end of January.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Order Public Meeting Handbills</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">All congregations will want to schedule public meetings for Sunday, March 25, and April 1 to give added emphasis to Memorial activity. The 1956 series may be used as of March 25. which means talk No. 1 can be scheduled the 25th and talk No. 2 on April 1. Congregations lacking qualified public speakers will arrange with nearby congregations for brothers who can serve. Handbill orders for these talks should be sent to the Society by February 15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Check Your Memory</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (4 min.) School servant is approached by three publishers, A. B and C, who can give effective sermons but want help presenting the offer effectively. Servant asks which sermons they give and where they got them. They answer as follows: (A) God’s Word Means Life; May, 1955, “Informant.” (B) God’s Purpose; January, 1955, “Informant.” (C) God's Kingdom; January, 1956, “Informant.” Servant: &quot;What do you say when you present the ‘Watchtower’ subscription after finishing your sermon?” Each demonstrates: “A” offers the magazine, merely saying it announces God’s kingdom. Servant counsels he did not tie offer in with the sermon. “B” merely says the magazine explains God’s purposes. Servant counsels that although he mentioned subject of sermon he did not show anything specific in magazine. “C” rambles through magazine article by article explaining all its features until servant interrupts and counsels that too much would confuse householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (4 min.) Servant suggests they turn to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Study 45 in “Qualified to Be Ministers.” He reads both paragraphs, highlighting and commenting on' (1) Introduce the literature, showing the person how the publications go into detail on the subject you talked about. (2) Open the book or magazine to certain striking statements. (3) Showing too many features of the literature at one time will wear out the householder. Servant: &quot;How can we find striking statements in the magazine related to our sermon?” &quot;A” suggests table of contents. Servant says this lacks enough information. “B” suggests reading entire magazine. Servant agrees this is best but often not quick enough. “C” has no suggestion. Servant suggests &quot;Check Your Memory” column as quickest way and asks publishers to try this method with the February 1 &quot;Watchtower.” After a little searching all find points related to their sermons and are anxious to try them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE III (15 min.) Servant has each one tell which question helped him, where in the magazine he will refer or read from, and then give a condensed four-minute version of his sermon, showing in conclusion how related points in the magazine can be tied in with sermon theme just prior to making the offer. At end of sermon, “A” (using question one) says: “We all need this spiritual help, but only those who know they need it can become happy. Why? The answer is in this magazine on page 67. Listen to what it says: [Reads pertinent sentences and makes offer ]” At end of sermon, “B” (using question three) says: &quot;This magazine explains God's arrangement for restoring what Adam lost. Note what it says on page 70: [Reads pertinent sentences and makes offer.]” At end of sermon, “C” (using question six) says: “We should not consider the Kingdom unimportant and seek other things, like those whose goal is material wealth. This is wrong, and this magazine warns us against such wrong viewpoints. Note what it says here on page 75: [Reads pertinent sentences and makes offer.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE IV (2 min.) Servant emphasizes value of “Check Your Memory” and “Do You Know” columns in “Watchtower” and “Awake!” magazines. All should regularly make good use of these columns for making effective presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Increasing Maturity Through Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (4 min.) Chairman shows need for all publishers to build real foundation in the truth through an accurate understanding of doctrines ‘and principles from God's Word. As a knowledge of basic information is essential for one to be qualified to teach, all should consider and apply material in the books “Let God Be True” and “This Means Everlasting Life”. (See paragraph 30. “Preaching Together in Unity.”) Though many have advanced quickly to an appreciation of field service, dedication and baptism, it Is likely they have not advanced to maturity. Those who have studied with them, or gossibly other mature brothers, should elp them by studying with them even after immersion, if the new publishers wish to continue study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (5 min.) Publisher hands Bible study servant a Study Record, just before meeting, commenting that study has been stopped because Brother New is now baptized and publishing. Servant notes Brother New has not completed study of both “Let God Be True” and “This Means Everlasting Life”. Publisher does not see need and feels Brother New will pick up enough information at congregation meetings, etc., now that he is one of us. Servant explains necessity of a solid foundation by accurate knowledge of basic doctrines and shows need for study to be continued until two publications have been completed. “Can I count time, back-calls and a study?” publisher asks. Servant replies time spent studying with baptized publisher is not to be reported. Points out continued study and field service training are expressions of love to help new one reach maturity. Publisher, in harmony with the arrangement, sees wisdom of resuming the studies but making no report. Servant urges publisher to take new publisher to service center book study each week too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE 111 (4 min.) After service meeting Brother New and publisher approach Bible study servant. Publisher asks that the arrangement be explained to Brother New. After servant explains, Brother New expresses his appreciation for this loving provision. Publisher and Brother New then discuss and select a time for the study when it will not interfere with other service arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE IV (2 min.) Chairman stresses need for all to grow in knowledge and understanding and how regular study as outlined above will make for Increased maturity in New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2d Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hell (page 154 to John 19: 41 on page 157)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Congregation discussion of definition, origin, true meaning of hell from original words, place of no pain or pleasure, dead in land of nonexistence, individual burial places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hell (page 157 to 2 Tim. 4: 7, 8 on page 161)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Return call with prepared sermon made on householder who wishes to know what Jehovah's witnesses believe about hell. Arrangements made at end of discussion to make return call to discuss Gehenna and Tartarus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing ... Good Works </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Coat'd} </span><span class="font3">fectively by first giving simple but forceful three- to eight-minute sermons. Where a subscription is obtained three booklets, including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”, </span><span class="font3">should be left. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions can also be offered along with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower subscriptions.</span><span class="font3"> If a subscription is not obtained, two single copies can be offered for 10c. Call back later to see if subscriptions can be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Overcome February Lag</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> During past campaigns February has proved to be a month in which fewer subscriptions are taken. There are several reasons for this, but most of these can be minimized greatly or even eliminated altogether. Cold weather should not deter any. With proper planning brothers will be able to concentrate on city territory or districts where apartment houses are located during the coldest weather. Every Sunday plan to spend at least two hours in house-to-house work and another hour or so making back-calls and arranging to start home Bible studies. During the week there will also be opportunity to share in the service. Many brothers will have two holidays in February that can be used for field service with the regular offer. Make February a full month*of rich works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> With the subscriber's having </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”, </span><span class="font3">the groundwork is already laid for a back-call and a book study. Obtaining a subscription or placing copies of magazines is merely the first step in finding and feeding the sheep. Be sure to call back on all placements a week or two later, prepared to give ten- to fifteen-minute Bible sermons and arrange to start studies wherever possible. Accept your obligation to nourish the sheep with the living waters from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> During the four-month campaign the quota of subscriptions for congregation publishers is two, for regular pioneers and circuit servants 20 and for special pioneers 30. With everyone’s giving full support to service arrangements and showing a wealth of good works during February, this month will likewise stand out as a good month in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Notice!</span></h5>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Today, as never before in human history, there is a tremendous and urgent work to be done here on earth.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Home Bible studies are the most important means through which good-will persons come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. As their appreciation for the truth increases, they attend meetings, go out in the service and, on clearly seeing the issue, are moved to symbolize their dedication by water baptism. The time it takes for these developments to come about varies according to how good-will persons apply themselves to study and service, resulting in the question: Just how long should a home Bible study be conducted and reported?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Publishers may report studies, counting time and the back-calls, as long as the person with whom the study is being conducted has not symbolized his dedication by water baptism. This is true even though the person attends meetings and goes out in the service. It would be good to continue a study with such persons until </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be- True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font3"> are completed. If a person is not moved to symbolize his dedication after studying these tw-o basic publications, then it is up to the publisher to determine from circumstances whether or not the study should be 25th, following a good Saturday in field service, public talk No. 1 of the new series will be given. Then comes the special day, Monday the 26th, when the Memorial celebration is to be observed after 6 p.m. Many could make that Monday Magazine Day.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> An all-out effort should be made to help irregular publishers and new persons to join in worship during this time, which will prepare the way for the twenty percent increase to be reached by the end of April. Maybe March will have a new high peak because of this special campaign.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> When a person symbolizes his dedication by water baptism he becomes a part of the New World society, a brother in the truth. He takes on the whole load of responsibility as a minister, and any studies held with a new witness would not be counted as a home Bible study, nor would back-calls or witnessing time be reported. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font3"> limits time that can be reported to that spent preaching to “the public.” Paragraph 45) Does this mean the study should he stopped and that w’e are no longer interested in helping our new brother to become a mature praiser of Jehovah? No! We rejoice in the progress the new one has made, that he is now one of us and fully appreciate that for him to become a mature minister continued study is vitally necessary. Therefore, show real brotherly love by continuing the home Bible study with the new brother until </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font3"> are completed, even though neither witnessing time nor back-calls nor a study can be reported.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">Our December report is the best on record. Last December we had 163,-037 publishers and tins year 172,612 —our best report so far this service year, by 6,962 publishers! We are happy and rejoice over this increase and, although we made only 5.3 percent toward our 10 percent goal, we feel that it is a good report. In December extreme cold and floods were encountered in many sections, but yet 977 congregations reported “We Made It!” Did your congregation? If not, do not be discouraged, but diligently work toward the 20 percent peak for April. With the special April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> that will be used during March and April, both of these months give promise of being most outstanding. Certainly all of us will be conscious of our part and will look to Jehovah to pour out his blessing upon our efforts.</span></p>

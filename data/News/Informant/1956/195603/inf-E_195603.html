</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">February 10, 1956</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My dear Brothers Everywhere:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are looking forward to the evening of March 26, 1956, at which time all of us together will celebrate the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. We love him for his faithfulness, for he is the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and he made it possible for us to come to our God. We delight to give to Jehovah exclusive devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to show our gratitude and prove ourselves the ‘right kind of ministers,’ we must preach this good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. (1 Tim. 4: 6, NW; Matt. 24: 14) This results in sheep-gathering. Then comes the pleasure of proper feeding. Later, we train those gathered to be also Jehovah’s witnesses. In order to help these new ones to get out into the field for the first time during March and April of this year, the Society has arranged for a special distribution of the April 1, 1956, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This issue is something special. There are two outstanding articles in it that everyone should read: First, Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator, and, second, Communist Leaders Fear Bible Truth. This special April 1 issue of “The Watchtower” is a guide to all people who love life and will serve as an eye opener for such persons to view the conditions in Russia. During the six weeks from March 21 to April 30 the Society would like to distribute at least 10,000,000 copies of this particular issue. We hope to have this edition translated into Danish, Spanish, Norwegian, Finnish, German, Greek, French, Swedish, Italian and Hollandish. This same message will be going out all over the world in greater numbers than this magazine has ever gone before. If each publisher places an average of twenty copies of this particular issue of April 1, a marvelous witness will be given during this Memorial season. Furthermore, use the leading article with study questions to start Bible studies. Try to make twenty back-calls on these twenty placements and use this magazine to start your Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness he will bless the distribution of the special message contained in this issue of “The Watchtower” as all of us together continue to shine as &quot;the light of the world.”—Matt. 5: 14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother, happy in Jehovah's service,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“How Are We Doing?”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> From the first day to the last, March will be a month of extra activity for all to prove that they are the right kind of ministers. (1 Tim. 4:6, A'Iff) It being the third month of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign it will find us still very busy obtaining subscriptions. With every publisher being “subscription-conscious” by now, It should be the finest month yet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> How are we doing? Fine, as shown by our excellent January report of 111,730 new subscriptions ’ Are you keeping pace? As a congregation publisher do you have at least one subscription? As a regular pioneer, ten? As a special pioneer, fifteen? If so, fine! Keep pressing on. If not, why not? Examine your activity and find out why. Ask yourself : “Am I doing sufficient house-to-house work? Is my sermon effective? Am I following up all leads, magazine placements, etc.?” If your answer is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No</span><span class="font5"> to any of these questions, then take all steps possible to increase and improve your service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Did you try the sermons given in the January and February issues of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">House-to-house work with subscription offer. Do not forget to offer magazines when the regular offer is not taken. (4) Monday, March 26: Special Memorial Magazine Day, with emphasis on working business establishments. In most communities business is usually slow on Monday, so this will be a good time to present magazines to business people and storekeepers. The more mature publishers can work the business sections, while others share in house-to-house magazine work. Utilize every opportunity from March 21 on to place copies of the special magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) formant?</span><span class="font5"> Excellent results are being reported by those using them. One publisher wrote: “Results of using sermon in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant—</span><span class="font5">14 subs the first week!” Spend a few minutes on the service meeting program hearing local experiences. If all right kind of ministers use these or other effective sermons and work from house to house at least two hours each Sunday in March, there is little reason why their personal goals cannot be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> When persons turn down the offer of the subscription and the three booklets for $1, drop down to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Right Kind of Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wherein lie the proofs of our ministry? One of them is in our continuing to preach and tell people of good will of God’s kingdom, whether conditions are favorable or unfavorable. This Jehovah’s witnesses do, as shown in the 1956 “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nineteen centuries ago in Palestine there were many Christians. Today in Israel very few people will listen. (76) But the right kind of ministers do not give up. Whether people hear or do not want to hear, the Kingdom message is being proclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For three years a lady in Chile had been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> nun of the most sacrificial order, but left with an empty heart. For fourteen years more she served with the &quot;Evangelical Army of Chile.” Thereafter she learned the truth and is now serving as a happy right kind of minister. (113)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does persecution, opposition or anything else stop right kind of ministers? No! And by faithfully ministering good fruitage results, as shown in the fine experience from Colombia. (117)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the comforting yeartext in mind brothers in Costa Rica did not let an invasion by armed forces deter them from serving as right kind of ministers and ended the month with a new peak of publishers. (119)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the stand that right kind of ministers take to hold fast to their neutrality is not always understood by the old world, it is respected and commented on. Consider the remarks by a noted playwright and author in Denmark. (127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the proofs of our ministry is that of continuing to preach regardless of prevailing circumstances. As right kind of ministers let us faithfully minister to the needs of the sheep and of one another in our assigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministry of New Publishers(</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cont’d} </span><span class="font4">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Good-will persons should be given personal invitations to the Memorial service and assisted, where necessary, to attend. Take the January 15, 1956, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> w-ith you and discuss briefly the meaning of Memorial. Show them particularly paragraph 19, on page 60, regarding the importance of good-will persons’ attending.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Congregation servants should double check to see that all arrangements for the Memorial service itself are taken care of. The hall should be clean and well arranged for the evening; it should be open early and brothers should be on hand to welcome strangers and persons of good will. Make them feel at home and invite them to attend our meetings regularly. At the close of the talk invite all to obtain a supply of the special April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and to share in field service, especially during the coming week end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> With special activity and Memorial scheduled for March, an all-out effort should be made to help irregular' publishers and new persons to join in service during this time, which will prepare the way for the 20 percent increase to be reached by</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> As soon as you have read the April I </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> you will realize how vitally important it is to bring its message home to the public. It expresses clearly how the Creator will shortly unite mankind. Also, it tells why Communist leaders fear Bible truth. Everyone should read it. It is our job to see that they do. What will you say? When will you place it? The brief presentations below will help you. Use them-</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Engaging in prestudy service, you might say: ’'Good evening. I’ve come by to tell you briefly about this new issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> When I read here that shortly all mankind will be united in peace, under the Creator, I wanted to be sure other persons read it also. This copy, with its companion </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> is yours on a small contribution of 10c.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> On Magazine Day, after introducing yourself, say: “I’ve stopped by to bring you the latest copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> I feel sure you will want to read them, particularly this amazing true story in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> about Russia. It tells of at least fifty slave labor cities in that country, some containing as many as 120,000 to 400,000 slaves. The only crime that many of these persons committed was to possess and read the Bible. In spite of inhuman treatment by the Communists, these Christians are maintaining their faith in their God. You will find their story heart-stirring</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In calling on professional people or storekeepers, we might say: “We read so much today about communism’s taking over the minds and thinking of many people and how-fearful the free nations are of its power. I feel that you will want to read that Communist leaders fear Bible truth. There is a splendid article on that subject in this copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> I know you will be glad to have it along with this copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for a 10c contribution.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> When working with the regular offer and a subscription is not obtained, you could say: “I am certain you will at least want to read this particular issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5">It has two especially absorbing articles in it that everyone should read. The main article on ‘Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator’ is an exceptional message, while the true story of life in Russian slave labor camps is heart-rending. Here is your copy with its companion magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> for only a 10c contribution.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Beginning March 21, go all out to get this specially prepared issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> into the hands of the people. Use these or your own presentations, but prove you are the right kind of ministers by helping others into the service and by letting your light shine in March and April.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Service Center Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (5 min.) Having’ particularly in mind the all-out activity In March and April, the chairman directs two questions to the audience: (1) How can we help new and irregular publishers at our service centers to engage in the service during March, April and all other months? (2) What are the duties of a congregation book study conductor? (See “Preaching Together in Unity,” paragraphs 21, 131, 132 and 142.) Audience answers questions, then chairman invites them to listen to the discussion and note its application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (7 min.) Assistant congregation servant and study conductor are discussing problems of aiding publishers, new and old, with study group. It is apparent that conductor wants to do his best, but negative thinking and poor organization hamper him. He is worried about what to do to help all working from his service center to publish during March and April. Servant explains that training program will care for some (“theocratic companions&quot; work regularly together), and. all others can effectively be assisted by those at the service center. How? Servant asks what he does with publisher list received the 1st and the 15th of each month. Conductor tries to call on each one himself, but is just not able to get around to see them all. Servant suggests; (1) Assign other mature brothers to share. (2) Arrange midweek service, for many are free mornings or afternoons to work and this is an excellent time to assist others. (3) Make exact announcements of service activity at group study and organize service so that all get in field on time. (4) Make definite arrangements with individual publishers to call on and assist ones needing help. (5) Set example in promptness, organization and zeal; lead, do not drive. Conductor appreciates counsel, but asks: “How can all this be done? There is hardly time after the study to make such arrangements.&quot; Servant invites him to observe a model study group closely, to see how all this can be done in five minutes or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (5 min.) On concluding congregation study, conductor makes announcements of field service and meetings, stressing punctualness, tells where and when midweek contacts will be held and who will care for them, invites all for back-call night and then concludes with prayer. After prayer he asks to talk with several individual publishers briefly: (1) On basis of list from assistant congregation servant, he asks brother to call on two of the publishers living near him and to help them in field service before week is up. (2) He personally arranges to take irregular publisher with him in Saturday magazine service. (3) He talks with sister who will oversee midweek contact and asks her to call on and take in service publisher who cannot go out Sunday morning because of husband’s opposition. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(4) He</span><span class="font4"> inquires of brother he talked to last week of progress made to assist new publisher. SCENE IV (2 min.) Chairman shows that bearing our own responsibilities and helping others will not only aid us to reach new peaks in March and April, but will build up regularity and maturity if maintained. Well-organized service activities and proper lead by conductor bring increase.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Coming Literature Offer</span></h4>

<p><span class="font4">Placing the April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font4"> ‘‘Watchtower” Chairman (3 min.) Be conscious of and take advantage of every opportunity to place the April 1 “Watchtower.” As outlined in the president’s letter, each one of us should place at least twenty copies of it. All will be able to do so by putting into practice the following suggestions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (4 min.) Publisher makes regular subscription offer, which is taken by householder. Publisher leaves the April 1 issue with new subscriber. What if householder had turned down subscription? Illustrate publisher’s using Presenting the Good News suggestion in placing the special issue under these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (3 min.) Brother reads April 1 issue during lunch hour. He savs to fellow worker: “Here is something that I did not know,” and comments on interesting point he is reading. Brother places copy with fellow employee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE III (4 min.) For visiting friends and others who call at your door have a supply of magazines available for use. While the sister and a visiting friend are talking, an insurance man calls. The sister places a copy with him just before he leaves and after he leaves she continues discussion of it with the visiting friend, placing a copy with her also</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE IV (3 min.) At conclusion of home Bible study publisher enthusiastically talks about the April 1 “Watchtower” and its value to honest-hearted persons. He tells of the ease and joy in placing copies and invites person of good will to share in its distribution To the good-will person’s “What could I say?” publisher supplies fifteen- to thirty-second presentation that may be used and makes definite arrangements for time and day to work together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE V (3 min.) Study conductor calls on irregular publisher and enthusiastically talks about special distribution of the April 1 “Watchtower ” He offers publisher some copies he can use among friends and relatives and makes definite arrangements to do prestudy service together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chairman (3 min.) Concludes by encouraging all to place at least twenty copies of the April 1 “Watchtower” and to make notations of placements, so that back-calls can be made in accord with information in the president’s letter.</span></p>

They should be made out in duplicate and at least once each week a copy turned over to the accounts servant with corresponding money to cover literature placed. The original will lie retained by the literature servant for posting the Progressive Inventory of Literature at the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The Literature Check Sheet is very easy to use. Each time a book, booklet, etc., is placed a tally mark is made, or where several of the same publications are obtained at one time, the number itself can be written down. Use care to fill it out accurately as literature is placed. Circuit servants will make a point to check and see that this sheet is being properly used. When the literature servant and his assistant(s) become accustomed to using the Literature Check Sheet, they will find it a real timesaver.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>New Circuit Assembly Program</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Starting the middle of February a completely new circuit assembly program goes into effect. It follows the theme from start to finish “Be Rich in Right Works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> You will not want to miss any of the assembly program, which starts Friday evening at 7 p.m. In place of the service meeting Friday evening following the ministry school, there will be two very special talks. One will be given by the circuit servant and the other by the district servant. Both talks are very important and deal with subjects of vital concern to every publisher, servant, pioneer and person of good will in the circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Be sure to arrange your affairs so that, when you are notified of the time and location of your circuit assembly, you will be able to attend </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all three days.</span><span class="font5"> Also invite and assist good-will persons to attend with you. Your blessings and expressions of appreciation at the end of the three days will be many, and, to be sure, you will be better equipped to “be rich in right works.”</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14: 40, A IV) To aid congregations co follow this Scriptural rule during the circuit servant’s visit, a new form has been provided. It is designed to assist the circuit servant and congregation to get a clearer picture of the training program and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font5">schedule service activities throughout his visit. For the circuit servant to be of the greatest help to publishers in the training program and to make adjustments where necessary, he must work with them in the field. The form outlines field activity for the week, starting Wednesday morning with house-to-house work scheduled for the morning. House-to-house witnessing or back-call and home Bible study work will be done afternoons. Evenings, before the scheduled service center study, house-to-house magazine or back-call activity will be scheduled, with the circuit servant working with the study conductor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Two copies of this form will be sent to the congregation servant with the first notice regarding the visit. He will then determine the three service centers with which the circuit servant will work and then list all publishers associated with the dedicated person’s getting out into the field and each one’s taking his Bible study attenders along.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> During April continue using the special April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> until the complete supply is exhausted. Participate in magazine distribution regularly and help new ones share in this and other service. Publishers not reporting by April 8 should be given help to let their light shine before mankind to the glory and praise of our Father, Jehovah. We feel we can make April a peak month in publishers if we start March 21 with the use of the special magazine and by aiding new publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">respective centers. From these the congregation servant, with the assistance of the book study conductor, should select those who will work with the circuit servant. Those selected should be from the group that will be served that day and should be those who are in the training program, or should be those next in line to be helped. If there are not sufficient publishers available with the study group being served to fill all appointments, then publishers from other service centers may be used to complete the schedule. All publishers in the congregation should be invited and encouraged to attend these contact points throughout the week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Three publishers in the morning and three in the afternoon should be scheduled to work with the circuit servant. Publishers selected should be talked to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">personally</span><span class="font5"> and the arrangement explained to them, especially the date, day and hour of appointment. Making these arrangements in advance will generally enable publishers and study conductors to get that day off from secular work or to make other adjustments to be present for the appointment.</span></p></li>

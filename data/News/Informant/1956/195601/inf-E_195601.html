<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is the source of all knowledge. When he speaks, all should listen and learn. And how does he speak? Through his appointed channel of communication—his collective congregation of anointed ones. By this means we learn of the diversified wisdom of God, as demonstrated in his marvelous creative acts and the irresistible outworking of his grand and thrilling purposes. What a joy<sup>r</sup> it is to have this grand information communicated to us by Jehovah “through the congregation,” as year after year we continue our happy association with it!—Eph. 3: 19, AHF.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">New Talks Start in March</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Following the example of Christ and his disciples, Jehovah’s ministers preach the good news “publicly and from house to house.” It is the privilege of many male servants of Jehovah to give public lectures and thus preach publicly from the platform as well as from house to house. Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> are new outlines for public lectures to be delivered during 1956, Assignments should be made to speakers right away so that they will be prepared to begin delivering them as of March 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Brothers selected by the committee to prepare and deliver public lectures should be mature and qualified to speak. Basically the same requirements are set for the public speaker as for a servant in the congregation.

On Monday, the second day, almost everyone will be free from his secular work, so all congregations will arrange for a special day of service. Let all of us help to get this campaign off to a good start by spending these first two days in intensive door-to-door preaching, presenting a year’s subscription for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine and three booklets (including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom&quot;)</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of $1.

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Campaigns Increase Circulation</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is not just another magazine. It is the foremost magazine Jehovah is pleased to use to announce this good news of the Kingdom. The information it contains is needed by all who hope to have life in God’s new world. Therefore, let each congregation arrange to witness thoroughly and completely to all homes in its territory during the 18th </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign. This will mean giving all persons an opportunity to subscribe for and regularly receive the outstanding Bible study aid—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Do you remember the first </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign? The year was 1939. A total of 134,211 subscriptions was obtained. In 1955, sixteen years later, 353,492 new subscribers were added to the evergrowing list during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">campaign. These campaigns have played a major role in increasing the circulation of this journal to its and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!—</span><span class="font3">on a contribution of $2 with six booklets given to subscribers. If one already subscribes for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> then offer the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscription. If the subscription is not taken, then endeavor to leave individual copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> on a 10c contribution and be sure to call back on prospective subscribers and all who show interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> By diligent effort and with Jehovah’s blessing upon our activity, undoubtedly all congregation publishers will be privileged to obtain at least two new subscriptions for the campaign, pioneers twenty and special pioneers thirty. As all serve zealously with Jehovah’s channel of communication the way will be opened for many more good-will persons to learn, through the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah’s grand and thrilling purposes now in course of fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible Sermons</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers throughout the world who use three- to eight-minute sermons find more joy than ever in their ministry and find that Bible sermons open the way for more effective witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While working apartments one never knows the ears that may be listening in addition to those of the person being spoken to. A good sermon overheard by the one next door, who was determined not to listen, prompted an immediate “come in” when the witness knocked on the door. Though literature is not always placed, sermons give people something to think about, as shown by the Catholic lady “who would take no literature but was held spellbound by the sermon.” (681</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A productive publisher in Fiji giving a sermon was interrupted by an officer with pencil and paper: &quot;Now what were those scriptures you read?&quot; After considering the scriptures the officer found the witness at the next door and subscribed for “The Watchtower.” (83)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Must one be old in age to give sermons? Not at all. A circuit servant in Brazil reports that two sisters of ten and thirteen years give the best of sermons and bring adults to the Kingdom Hall. (95)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In days gone by Jehovah’s witnesses were known to some in Burma as “book sellers.” But now, due to the sermons, they are known as “ministers of God.” (106) Publishers in India, like brothers everywhere, find sermons practical and effective. (180)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are you preparing and using sermons? One that has proved very effective and practical is found in this “Informant.” Try it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom’’ Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the basic Bible study aid booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom” was released, it was suggested that it be used to start home Bible studies. As shown in the 1956 “Yearbook,” this good counsel was taken to heart, and gratifying results have been forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Philippines an alert brother discussed the Bible with fellow employees. “This Good News of the Kingdom” booklet opened the way for a study that has since progressed to “Let God Be True”. (243)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This powerful little booklet has proved to be a source of blessing to two faithful sisters in Anguilla, who have started many studies in it. (204) A sister in British Guiana will always appreciate the booklet as the instrument that helped her husband to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. (98) A preacher in New Zealand can be thanked for awakening one of his parishioners to commence studying the booklet. (219)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon receiving request for 'easy-to-understand reading matter’ from a schoolteacher of religion in West Germany “This Good News of the Kingdom” booklet was sent. Did the children understand it? At their request the teacher ordered booklets for all. (154-155)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other booklets, too, of course, are instruments that open the way for people to learn the truth. In Angola the leader of a native choir learned the truth and preached to others from two booklets that had been thrown aw’ay. (262)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout the “Watchtower” campaign, let us wisely use “This Good News of the Kingdom” booklet as one of the three given to subscribers, and then be diligent to make return calls and start studies.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Too Many Magazines</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> During the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign many objections are raised by householders when publishers present the subscription offer. Most people who raise objections do not realize the importance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> nor its value in helping them to understand the Bible. It is our responsibility to meet these objections in a kind and tactful way and overcome them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> “I get sufficient magazines from my church.” You might reply : ‘Many people that we call on receive a church magazine because they desire to keep informed on different functions of the church. Generally, church magazines deal with events going on in church and other religious topics, whereas </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> discusses only the teachings of the Bible. [Show variety of articles in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the scriptures given for support.] Truly, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> helps you to increase your faith in the Bible by helping you to a better understanding of it.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> &quot;I have so many (worldly) magazines now.” An answer: ‘Many people today take more magazines than they can read and, of course, this involves much unnecessary expense. But I am sure you will agree that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to be</span><span class="font3"> accurately informed of w<sup>T</sup>orld conditions and their meaning is of great importance. Many magazines aptly tell of and picture present conditions but offer no remedy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Points of Interest. . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font3">that more house-to-house work results in more subscriptions? It certainly does! Keep up the good work, regular and special pioneers, and let all congregation publishers arrange to increase their house-to-house ministry. Be diligent to spend at least two hours in house-to-house work each Sunday morning before your one or more hours of back-call activity. In addition to this, at every opportunity engage in house-to-house work during the week. By doing this and by having sermons well prepared, it could be the good pleasure of congregation publishers to average at least two new subscriptions for the first time since the Sth campaign in 1946, which was the only year thus far when congregation publishers have averaged two new subscriptions. Pioneers will set their quota at twenty and special pioneers at thirty. Pioneers, putting in ten times more hours, should However, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> being based on the highest source of knowledge, God's Word the Bible, will help you to understand the true meaning of world conditions and the remedy, God’s kingdom. It discusses a variety of subjects, such as world conditions in the light of Bible prophecy, doctrine, Bible principles and historical events, so that It eliminates your need for many other magazines. The Bible shows that our future, in fact our very life, depends upon the decisions we make today. Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> aid you in making a wise decision.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> “I do not get time to read the newspaper, let alone magazines.” ‘There is no question about it, all of us are busy these days. But we never get too busy to eat, do we? No matter what we are doing we stop to take out time to eat. If we did not, why, we wouldn’t be here today. Note what Jesus said . . . [Read Matt. 4:4, or Deut. 8: 3 to Jewish persons.] This shows the importance of regularly taking in spiritual food, which is the purpose of this magazine.’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">Congregation Prepares Sermon</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was a pleasure for the Society to receive reports from congregations stating that the three- to eight-minute and ten- to fifteen-minute sermon outlines in the October, 1955, “Informant” have been of much assistance to brothers. Since the arrangement to supply an outline for the entire congregation to discuss and develop and then use in the field has been so successful, another very practical outline is shown below. It will be handled in the same manner as the last ones. Brothers should be encouraged to study the outlines before coming to the meeting and to have with them a pencil and paper to jot down points they wish to remember. It would be well for the school servant or another capable brother to serve as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Three- to Eight-Minute Sermon Theme: God’s Kingdom</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. Introduction</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Taught to pray for it—Matt. 6: 10* 3. Real government—with King—Isa.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">9: 6, 7 (To rule entire earth—Ps. 72: 8)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Will destroy wicked rule—Dan.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2: 44 (Pray for this—Matt. 6: 10)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5. Kingdom blessings—Prov. 29: 2</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">6. Purpose in calling—Matt. 24: 14* “Watchtower” announces Kingdom—offer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">* (These two scriptures may be paraphrased in sermon.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some introductions that may effectively lead into Matthew 6: 10 are: ‘I am calling to bring you some good news about God’s kingdom. Regardless of where one lives or what his religion or circumstances of life may be, almost everyone prays. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘I am making brief visits at the homes today with a message especially interesting to people who desire good government. It concerns God’s government, which we pray for. . . .’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘I am calling with a message of good news. That sounds strange, doesn’t it, in a time when it seems there is nothing but bad news? But this message I am bringing is to tell you how, in the near future, conditions will reverse and go back to the conditions that existed before Adam’s fall. This will be made possible through the Kingdom we all pray for. . . .’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the sermons have been discussed and developed by the congregation, then the chairman will call on two different publishers to use this sermon outline and give a three- to eight-minute talk. The publishers may be told in advance, in order to have their presentation prepared for delivery before the congregation. Two weeks after this sermon is developed by the congregation, it is suggested that ten minutes be allowed on the meeting to hear experiences of brothers who have used this sermon. Allowing about twelve minutes for the congregation discussion and six minutes for each of the two sermons will make this part on the service meeting about twenty-four minutes in length.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Starting March 4, 1956, circuit servants will give the public talk “Attaining Victory in Christian Warfare.” The new public talk to be given by the district servant at circuit assemblies, starting in February, is “Consulting God on World Affairs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Getting an Invitation In</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (2 min.) Chairman covers cold-weather problem that confronts publishers and householders. Witnessing must be continued regardless of weather and efforts must be made on the part of publishers to give an effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (14 min.) Two publishers just home from service remove coats and discuss morning witnessing results. Brother Zealous is enthusiastic about his good results, while Brother I. Try does not have much to say. Zealous gives good experience had at home where he was invited in, which resulted in a subscription. “But that’s just the trouble,” complains I. Try, ‘‘no one ever invites me in. Most people are willing to freeze with me at the door for just a minute or so before they close the door.” Just then Sister Zealous comes in from a Bible study and is Invited to join discussion: “How to get people to listen even in cold weather.” Zealous suggests it would be wise to w’ork for an invitation to come in before attempting to give the sermon. To I. Try’s “It sounds good, but how can it be done?&quot; Zealous replies that to put people at ease one must first properly identify himself. Names usually are insufficient. In what capacity are you calling? Why not say: “I represent a society of ministers calling to talk to people in their homes. May I step in for a moment?” Sister Zealous thinks it good and that she might say: “I am a minister's wife, calling because I am interested in you and your family. May I step in for just a few minutes?” or “I am a Bible teacher. May I . . . ?” I. Try expresses agreement and adds that doing this shows consideration for householder. “But what if you are not invited in?” I. Try asks. If more is required before being invited, Zealous suggests following up introductory words with a statement as to the purpose of calling, like this: “We are pointing to the need for Bible education to combat the rising tide of delinquency.” Or, “We are calling to help those who love the truth to understand just why God permits all the distress in the world.” Having told the purpose of calling, if circumstances are such that you would accept an invitation into the home, give householder opportunity to show his hospitality, for many people are naturally hospitable, and if we but pause to give them opportunity they will invite us to step in out of the cold. Sister Zealous comments that by our plunging right into a sermon householders may think we do not want to come in. Brother Zealous agrees and tells how one must be discerning and not lose his opportunity to talk by quickly going into his sermon if not invited in. In answer to I. Try’s, “Do you always go In?” Sister Zealous replies that oftentimes when working alone and when there is only a man in the house she is calling on she finds it best to talk at the doorway. If other members of the family are in evidence she gladly takes advantage of an invitation into the home, to present the message more effectively where householders can listen In a more relaxed frame of mind. I. Try expresses appreciation for suggestions and asks if Zealous ■will listen to him as he tries a couple of introductions on Sister Zealous as householder, for an invitation to come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE III (2 min.) Chairman concludes with encouragement to all to apply these practical suggestions. Once in, publishers should not stay too long.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Suggestions to Facilitate the Handling of Subscriptions</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Subscriptions should be printed legibly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Be sure to show the proper name of the post office on the subscription slip. Mail cannot be sent to stations. The name of the main post office or branch office must also be shown on the slip.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Congregation servants should check the subscription slips before signing the Subscription Record sheet to make sure that the names and addresses are complete and correct before they are sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> We receive many </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions for languages that the magazines are not printed in. Carefully check the “Published in the Following Languages” column found on the inside cover of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Selection of Speakers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a good example in Christian living. (See paragraph 133 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The committee should not select a brother who does not speak with sufficient force, warmth and coherence. He should speak fluently in the language in which the talk is to be given. (1 Cor. 14: 9, A ID The school servant is in good position to comment on the qualifications of prospective speakers. Brothers must first prove themselves qualified by applying themselves in the ministry school and otherwise in the various features of the ministry. The trial and proving of speakers should be in the ministry school and not as public speakers, either at the Kingdom Hall or at service centers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The committee should be impartial in its selections and assignments, not being too lenient, nor too demanding. Each speaker will have his particular style of delivery, but the message he delivers should be a clear, forceful presentation on the subject assigned. People come to hear a Bible talk on God’s purposes, so too much time should not be spent reading clippings, discussing viewpoints of men, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Speakers should bring into play all the principles of good public speaking learned in the ministry school. Do not be bombastic or dogmatic, making assertions without proof. While we expose and denounce where required, we do so with proper taste and logic, always keeping in mind that our objective is to build up, not to offend our hearers and close their minds to the truth. (1 Tim. 4:12, AB’) Let all brothers given assignments to serve as public speakers begin working on the new talks right away.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Greater Activity This February</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The time is short! The days are few! The work is great! Let your work be unlike that of the millions of materialistic-minded selfish workers of this old world. Spiritual sickness and eventual death will be the reward for their vain works. Christians are admonished by Jesus to ‘preach this good news of the kingdom.’ This is the work that brings real happiness and joy. Give heed to the prize of life, which comes from showing a wealth of good works! —1 Tim. 6:18, AGP.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine uses God’s Word to show us what good works are and how we may display them. Appreciating these good works,</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Publisher’s Record Card File and Its Use</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> As pointed out in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unify,</span><span class="font3"> paragraphs 49 and 77, a Publisher’s Record card should be made out for each individual who reports field service. These cards will be divided into two alphabetical groups and will constitute the Publisher's Record card file. The first group will contain cards of those who have symbolized their dedication by water immersion. The second group will contain cards of those who have not as yet progressed to the point of symbolizing their dedication by baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> We should not rush a person into dedication, but it is the privilege and obligation of the more mature brothers to encourage those who are new in the service to continue progressing in the truth so that they accurately understand Jehovah's purposes and wish to dedicate their lives to his service. Having the Publisher’s Record card file divided in this manner will assist the servants to know who need help In this regard. After a person symbolizes his dedication, his card would be transferred to the file of dedicated, immersed publishers, who make up the real congregation of publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> After a publisher symbolizes his dedication by water immersion, certain privileges of service open up to him. A brother in the congregation would then be eligible, if otherwise qualified, to handle responsible parts on the service meeting program, to give instruction talks in the theo-we shall show them to others. During February this can be done by offering the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription and three booklets for $1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In January of last year the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign got off to a good start with 95,577 new subscriptions. However, in February we did not do so well, since only 78,302 were obtained. Let us make this February an outstanding month! How? By doing more Kingdom service. Knowing that the foremost way of obtaining subscriptions is by house-to-house work, you should prepare well to present the offer and then engage in the witness work as often as possible. Strive to increase your ministry so that the joys received from showing a wealth of good works will be greater.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">cratic ministry school and to represent the congregation in prayer to Jehovah. After he has published for at least a year after immersion he would be eligible for a servant’s position and to deliver public lectures, if otherwise qualified. One would be eligible for consideration for the regular pioneer service six months after his immersion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The file is of immeasurable aid to the servants and study conductors in ascertaining who need help to be regular and effective in the ministry. The assistant congregation servant should keep it up to date and then provide a list of publishers who did not report by the 15th of the month, and another list about the first of each month, showing those who did not report during the previous month. The cards in the two sections should be two straight alphabetical files. They are not to be broken down into book study groups or otherwise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Since the file is confidential, its use should be limited to the servants and conductors. With the assistant congregation servant supplying information regarding irregular and ineffective publishers, the study conductors should not need to check the files very often. (See paragraphs 77 and 97 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity.)</span><span class="font3"> Conductors should not keep a duplicate set of Publisher’s Record cards, or otherwise keep a record of publishers’ activity. This duplication of record keeping is not needed, since a complete record is kept by the assistant congregation servant.</span></p></li></ul>

Following brief summary of points previously discussed (144-147) he clears up for householder the purpose of early healing and how the gift was used, why it is not needed now and what will be accomplished under Kingdom. In conclusion study is started in &quot;Let God Be True&quot;, using chapter “A New Earth.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>JEHOVAH IS GOOD</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah Is good and very gracious. (Psalm 145) He richly pours out his spirit upon his visible organization, grants it a clear understanding of his Word and bestows blessings as it diligently serves. Appreciating his purpose in providing all this, his organization gratefully helps others to share in these blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are you, too, grateful for his goodness? And showing it by good works? Desiring to show gratitude and to have the greatest possible share in proclaiming the Kingdom message and finding and feeding the other sheep, why not express your thankfulness by increased field service? Pioneer? Yes, why not become a pioneer now! Send for information and an application today.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>ATTENTION PUBLIC RELATIONS SERVANTS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">An article entitled “The Embattled Witnesses” will appear in the January issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coronet</span><span class="font3"> magazine. Public relations servants might find it of interest for the clipping books they use in contacting editors. Publishers of the magazine claim a circulation of 6,000,000 copies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> A check should be made every month or so to see who are getting results in the field by placing literature, making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies. Those who are getting little or no results in the field should be given special assistance. The assistant congregation servant should pass this information along to the study conductors so that they or other mature brothers can give them the needed help.</span></p></li></ul>

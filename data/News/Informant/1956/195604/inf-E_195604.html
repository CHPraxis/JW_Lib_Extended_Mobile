<p><span class="font5">APRIL, 1956 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the </span><span class="font5">BROOKLYN N Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing.&quot;—Malachi 3: 10, AS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ * *</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SHINING AS THE “LIGHT OF THE WORLD” The Big 1956 Gathering Is On!</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Work to Make</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>In Publishers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Last April the world was made to know that Christendom is not the ‘light of the world,’ but that true Christianity is and that Jehovah’s witnesses are true Christians. Jesus’ words included us when he said: “You are the light of the world.” Therefore, “let your light shine before mankind, that they may see your right works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” —Matt. 5 :14,16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we hope to see, not only a 20 percent increase in publishers during April, but a new all-time peak in praisers of Jehovah. To report “We Made It I” will require 196,650 ministering. That is a lot of publishers! True, but to show that it can be done with Jehovah’s blessing, briefly review last year’s report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In December, 1954, we had a 5.9 percent increase, with 163,841 publishers. The April goal of 20 percent was 184,763. Would it be possible to have 21,000 additional publishers in the field by April? We all remember how Jehovah blessed our diligent work. We all took to heart the slogan “each one help one” and the result was a 21.5 percent increase. This year, similar to last year, our December report of 172,612 publishers (5.3 percent increase) stands approximately 24,000 short of our 196,650 goal for April. What must we do this year to reach it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Each One Help One”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> First of all, every publisher should set as a personal goal his being in the service and reporting by Sunday, April 8. The assistant congregation servant will give each study conductor a list of those who did not report by the Sth of the month. They will follow through quickly in checking with these pub-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>April an All-Time</span></h3>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> By the time this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> is received all publishers will have had opportunity to read the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> After reading it you will know why special distribution has been arranged, and certainly you will want to use it wisely to spread a flood of light into the minds of many now held captive by the darkness of this old world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Since this issue is written particularly for the public, it should be easy for all publishers to place an average of 20 copies. The March </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> under Presenting the Good News and Your Service Meeting, contains excellent suggestions for placing copies and should be reviewed by all. By offering the April 1 issue in these various ways, just as we did the booklet last year, none will have difficulty in placing them. By our remembering that our magazine goal this month is to double the magazine placements of one year ago, with each publisher placing a minimum of 20 of the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> plus the regular amount of the other issues, and by our reaching this goal, our April magazine report will be the greatest on record!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> If you have copies of the April 1 issue left when the April 15 issue is released, place the two together at the usual rate. Use the April 1 issue until the supply is exhausted. Any congregations needing additional supplies of the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">should rush their orders in and the Society will mail the magazines immediately. A stock will be kept on hand at the factory throughout the month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> As suggested by Brother Knorr in his letter last month, try to make 20 back-calls on the 20 magazine placements and use the magazine to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font5"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Peak Month</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>in Subscriptions and in Other Fields</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> This is the concluding month of the subscription campaign. How are we doing? The best ever so far! In January we obtained an all-time high for any </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign month, with 111,730 new subscriptions. And our February report showed 97,417, an increase of 35,208 subscriptions over this same two-month period of one year ago. Do you have your quota of two subscriptions, publishers? Of 20, pioneers? Of 30, special pioneers ? Increasing house-to-house service with good sermons will help you to reach your quota.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> This being the month for all-time peaks, let us work hard to make April a peak month for new subscriptions too. In addition to regular house-to-house service, making the subscription offer, follow up all subscription leads as in Presenting the Good News. No doubt many of these will want to subscribe.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What Can Happen in April</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> With “each one helping one,” April will be an all-time peak publisher month. With “each one” placing an average of 20 of the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> plus the usual amount of other issues, April will be an alltime peak magazine month. With “each one” making back-calls on the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> placements in addition to other regular back-calls, having in mind the starting of home Bible studies, April will be an alltime peak back-call and home Bible study month. With “each one” devoting all possible time to field service and making the subscription offer at every opportunity and following up leads, April will also be an all-time peak hour and new subscription month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> May Jehovah bless “each one” of us and our united efforts in all fields.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaign Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One year ago Jehovah's witnesses world-wide were in the midst of a special campaign pointing out the real light of the world by means of the booklet ‘‘Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is the Light of the World’?” What were the results? The “Yearbook” is literally filled with comments and experiences, a few of which follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Was the quota of 30 booklets for each publisher to distribute something impossible to accomplish? Not for any who were active in the field. A publisher in Belgium worked territory near her home and in 30 minutes distributed 20, obtained 10 more and placed them in another 20 minutes. On making a back-call on a booklet placement she started a Bible study with a neighbor who had previously mocked her. (91) Be sure to make back-calls on April 1 “Watchtower” placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That new ones may effectively share, a new publisher in British Guiana, though being sick, distributed 16 in a week and was instrumental in helping a good-will person to start studying, (97)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Antigua reports the booklet campaign was a real success and resulted in starting six new publishers. Unique was the method one publisher used to place 80 the first morning. (203) A brother in Haiti used a similar method to place 51 in three days (168) Why not try it with the April 1 “Watchtower”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tremendous enthusiasm accompanied distribution of the booklet in Australia. All shared, young, old, newly interested and veteran ministers. The result? The brightest month of activity on record. And enthusiasm did not die at the end of April, for all were fired with zeal to shine on and help others. (81)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The good results from the special booklet campaign world-wide are very gratifying and appropriately summarized by the president on pages 287. 288. With all of us zealously supporting the distribution of the special April 1 “Watchtower” in March and April, we shall look forward to good reports on this special campaign too.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Bearing Increased Light</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (Ps. 97:11) As a happy Kingdom announcer are you planning to reflect increasingly the light Jehovah has sown? Will your plans materialize? They will for a certainty if you enter the pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Have you not admired the zeal of foreign missionaries and wished circumstances were such that you could be one of them? Oh yes I you say, hut circumstances are such that I cannot. Well, then, have you thought about becoming a “home missionary,” a pioneer in your own congregation’s territory? Or, if you want a “foreign” assignment, the Society has ample unassigned territory for you. Whether in home territory or in unassigned territory, “let your light shine” and increase your right works now by taking up the pioneer work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>J</sup> Schools will soon be out and young ministers everywhere will be applying again for the vacation pio-</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>By Following Through on Subscription Promises</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Many times after we deliver our sermon and make the subscription offer householders say : “I can't take the subscription now, but if you call again I’ll take it.” What should the publisher do? Offer two magazines for 10c or should he make arrangements to call back for the subscription at the convenience of the householder ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The alert publisher will do both. He will offer the two magazines for 10c so that the person can read them to see their value and, additionally, he will make definite arrangements as to the time to return and obtain the subscription. One should not take the negative attitude that the householder is using this just as an excuse to get rid of him. In many cases the householder is sincere and will subscribe if the publisher follows through.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> After placing two magazines and in preparing for the return visit this might be said and done : “I’ll be glad to call back at the time you say and by then you will have opportunity to read this tine article ‘Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator.’ And, while thinking about it, why don’t I w rite your name and address on this subscription blank in order to have all the necessary information ready when I return to get your subscription? I know that you will want to receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> regularly neer service. We shall be looking forward to receiving applications of thousands who, as before, will use their vacation period to pioneer. Is this service limited to just the young ministers? No! </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font5"> ministers can plan on spending some time during this summer in this work. Last year, 1955, over 2,700 became vacation pioneers. In 1954, the year before, 4,380 were enrolled. What does this year hold forth? You supply the answer. If you cannot be a regular pioneer, then vacation pioneer for a month, two, or more months. And, remember, those with but a two-week vacation can be “two-week” vacation pioneers. Make wise use of your vacation time by pioneering!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> This month congregation servants may well plan a stimulating service meeting on the pioneer service and its blessings. Every publisher should feel his responsibility and make plans now to bear increased light this year as a pioneer. after reading this article and seeing its value as a Bible study aid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The return call should be made at the designated time. Should we just say; “I’m back in the neighborhood again and have stopped by for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription you said that you would like to have”? This kind of approach would be cold and unfriendly and would hardly be enough to rekindle their interest in the subscription. You might say something like this: “Good morning Mr. for Mrs.] —. How<sup>r</sup> are you today? I am the minister, Mr. ----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that called on you a short time back w’ith the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine. In the issue that I left is the article ‘Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator.’ Wasn't it a pleasure to read here on page 200, under the subheading ‘Not just a dream’ [have copy in hand] that God is going to accomplish what man has failed to do all these years, namely, unite all righteous mankind under his kingdom? Many people living in this divided, disturbed old world have expressed great appreciation for the comforting Bible information found in this article. Of course, for us to be united with our Creator, we must know his purposes and what he wants us to do. That is the sole purpose of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Each issue helps us as Christians to better understand the Bible and points forward to the only hope for mankind, God’s kingdom. I have the subscription blank that I filled out the last time I was here and shall be happy to send it in for you. A year’s subscription is only $1.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0</sup> Be alert to all subscription possibilities throughout April and this is likely to be a record campaign.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Help New Ones to Preach </span><span class="font3">(Use this demonstration on the fust service meeting in April)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> min.) Sets </span><span class="font3">theme, gives facts and figures on prospects for reaching 20 percent increase and how home Bible studies are big field from which increase will come. Congregation’s attention is directed to following new arrangement being introduced to aid new ones to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE 1 (10 min.) Bible study servant approaches two or three study conductors at Kingdom Hall. Discussion starts with peak Memorial attendance and how therein lies 20 percent increase potential, since many were undoubtedly good-will persons with whom Bible studies are held. The Scriptural need to help these persons to attend meetings regularly, to continue study and start in service is discussed. In answer to conductors' question, “What can we do?” Bible study servant provides each with a list containing the names of publishers conducting Bible studies, and opposite the publisher's name, the name of person(s) studied with as well as date study was started. This gives conductor over-all picture of increase potential for his service center. Conductors appreciate list and ask how it is to be used. Bible study servant suggests that conductors contact each publisher conducting a study and discuss with him definite ways in which he can encourage and aid the person studied with to share in preaching work during April, as follows: 1. At completion of weekly study briefly discuss Scriptural need for all to share knowledge learned with others. (Isa. 50: 4; Gal. 6: 6, NW) 2. Discuss urgent need for all mankind to have opportunity to know of Jehovah’s provision to unite all obedient mankind under Kingdom. 3. Purpose of the April 1 “Watchtower&quot; is to help fill this need. 4. Demonstrate the ease of presenting magazine, actually telling what to say (Use Presenting the Good News and Your Service Meeting suggestions of March &quot;Informant”). 5. Encourage, invite and make definite arrangements for time and date to work together before congregation book study, Magazine Day, Sunday witnessing, etc. Study conductors then freely express their views on new arrangement and make additional suggestions they might have that have been effective. All are eager to do their part. In conclusion Bible study servant reviews briefly the counsel on new ones' reporting preaching, found in Congregation Organization, and points out that publishers starting new ones to preach should understand proper reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (4 min.) Study conductor talks to publisher on list of those who have conducted study sometime without aiding person in service. He outlines the need for the publisher to take the initiative to help the person to preach and explains now it may tactfully be done by following the five points mentioned by Bible study servant Publisher expresses appreciation for helpful information, which he promises to apply right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (4 min.) </span><span class="font3">At conclusion of the study the publisher applies suggestion, which results in definite arrangements being made with person studied with to engage in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chairman (2 min.) Stresses need for all to co-operate. It will be the means of assisting many to start preaching, in accord with Jehovah’s commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Studies in the April 1 “Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (2 min.) </span><span class="font3">The placement of the April 1 “Watchtower” opens the way for many discussions and back-calls w ith persons of good will. Our aim? Place an average of 20 magazines each and follow up placements with back-calls. Simple, logical presentation in main article lends itself to study by new persons. Make your back-calls with the goal of starting studies in mind. Effective, short, special sermons will open way for many home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 1 (10 min.) </span><span class="font3">Couple at home plan for calls they will make on April 1 issue placements. As most magazines were placed without using three- to eight-minute sermons, they feel that a short back-call sermon that will get right into the magazine would be most effective and enable them to make more back-calls and start studies. Theme: “Need for Uniting Mankind” is chosen. What will they say to get started? Perhaps the opening words might be: “Good evening. Since placing the ‘Watchtower’ magazine with you last week, I’ve been eager to talk to you about the article 'Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator.’ As you read it, undoubtedly you thought, like most people I’ve talked to, how good it would be if the world were united in peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sermon</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. At Psalm 133:1 the writer expressed the same thought when he wrote (read or quote and then comment as to how unity would bring joy and peace among nations and people).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. World should be one happy family, as all are of one flesh, having descended from Adam, the first man. Refer to first few sentences of paragraph 1 (read or give essence of) and then ask question, “What causes the division?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Note how nicely paragraph 2 tells us (read down to Zechariah 14: 13).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Then direct householder’s attention to question on paragraph 2, and after pointing to Matthew 12: 25, 26 (located in paragraph 2) suggest that householder get his Bible so this important point can be looked up and discussed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Couple agree this will be an easy and effective way to attract initial interest in the article and to start a home Bible study. They are eager to apply this special follow-through sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (10 min.) </span><span class="font3">At back-call the brother follows the above sermon. Interest is manifested by the good-will person, a few paragraphs are discussed and arrangements are made for another call, to continue consideration of article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (3 min.) </span><span class="font3">Back-calls on magazine placements will produce results if publishers are prepared. Getting the right start is vitally necessary. Place the magazines, keep a record of placements and then call back. Use this sermon or one of your own that will lead into a discussion of the material in special issue. As discussion progresses, use “Let God Be True” as a reference. Show how various points considered are enlarged upon in book. Example: paragraph 19 discusses God’s proper name and its meaning, as does Chapter II in “Let God Be True”. This will allow for an easy transition into a study of “Let God Be True” when magazine is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Magazine Placements </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font5">start home Bible studies. It is an excellent issue to use in this regard, as shown in the Your Service Meeting demonstration of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font5">“Starting Studies in the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.”</span><span class="font5"> Try it for good results.</span></p>

However, where the distances are comparable it will be helpful if you can arrange to attend the city suggested by the Society, to help adjust attendance to conform with convention facilities, as well as to accomplish the desired witness. For instance, Florida Circuits Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 could preferably go to Montgomery, Ala.; northern Vermont and New Hampshire, to Troy; Ohio Circuit No. 9, to Louisville instead of Columbus; Maryland Circuits Nos. 1 and 2 and Cleveland and suburban congregations to Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Circuit No. 1, to Reading; Minnesota Circuit No. 1 may attend Mandan. More detailed information will accompany the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A prime requisite for receiving and keeping Jehovah’s love, which leads to life, is a special kind of love outlined at 1 John 3:18, AW, a love shown by deed and truth as well as by word. This love must be shown by us to Jehovah, our brothers and prospective brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Love may be shown to all three at once during May by unitedly presenting the book Yow </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World </span><span class="font5">and a booklet on a 50c contribution.

<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Home Bible Studies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup>Who of those in Jehovah’s New World society has not been helped to a knowledge of Jehovah and his requirements through home Bible studies? Very few of us learned the truth without this service, and none without the loving assistance of Jehovah’s organization. The home Bible study is the chief means of bringing good-will persons on to maturity and aiding them to become associated with others in the New World society and share in the preaching of the good news.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> At times a publisher is overheard to say: “I leave the Bible study work for those more qualified than I am.” Then, strange as it may seem, some fail to arrange for a home Bible study because they “do not have time for one.” Who will say to the Master of the flock that he is not capable or cannot become qualified to conduct a Bible study, and who will attempt to excuse himself by saying he does not have time to feed the Lord’s “other sheep”? No, we cannot afford to excuse ourselves. Otherwise, we find ourselves spending much time covering territory, placing literature and finding interested ones, and then failing to reap the results because of not conducting home Bible studies. Prepare for and make back-calls on April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> placements as well as other placements, and you will undoubtedly be able to start at least one Bible study in April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> As studies are conducted, the publisher should always keep in mind why the study is being conduct-</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Well as in Word</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">the special issue of the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> should be encouraged to get a few magazines every month and to distribute them in house-to-house work, street work or among their friends. Keep them preaching as regular publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ed: It is “with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” From the very start we should have in mind helping the person studied with to absorb the truth and use what he learns to serve and please Jehovah. Praising Jehovah is a basic requirement to gaining life in his new world. Do not withhold from them this privilege. April is an excellent time to get them started with distribution of the April 1 WwtcTi-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tower.</span><span class="font5"> Also, invite and assist them to attend congregation book studies and Kingdom Hall meetings regularly. Help them to get acquainted and feel at home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> When a person of good will shares in the service, the mature publisher should instruct him on proper reporting. If he understands that his witnessing activity contributes to the preaching of the good news and wants to turn in a report, he should be encouraged to do so. A little incidental witnessing, without having shared in one of the regular features of the service, hardly makes one </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> publisher, although the report on this service will be counted if turned in. (See paragraphs 49 and 50 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Regular participation In the service, attendance at the congregation meetings and the personal assistance you give through the home Bible study will keep the new publisher progressing and soon he will see the importance of dedicating his life to Jehovah’s service. Therefore, “Feed the sheep,” Kingdom publishers, and make full use of the home Bible study as the chief means of doing so.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Unassitjned Territory Campaign</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">During July, August and September special effort will be made to witness to all persons living in unassigned territory. The Society has revised the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Unassigned Territory in the United States</span><span class="font5"> and is sending a copy to each congregation with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> along with an Unassigned Territory Application and a special letter of instructions, which should be read or discussed on the service meeting by a competent brother. Pioneers or groups of pioneers wishing to work unassigned territory should write immediately for an application, while congregations can use the one sent with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font5"> Select the territory you desire to work and submit your application to the Society before </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">May 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Publishers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(C ant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ushers, encouraging and aiding them to get into the service. Again the 15th and the 22d of the month a list will be given to them by the assistant congregation servant so they will have up-to-date information to work on. With each one helping another, undoubtedly all 185,000 publishers who have cards in congregation files will serve and report.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> But, as you can see, with all 185,000 publishers out it still leaves us over 11,000 short of the 196,650 goal. What more must we do?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Help New Ones to Start!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Yes, we must assist those with whom we study to take the next step toward life—join in preaching the good news. (Rom. 10:9, 10, AW) There are over 109,000 home Bible studies being conducted. Surely many thousands of these know enough of the truth to start preaching and will be thankful for your encouragement and help in assisting them to let their light shine. New ones can begin by offering the April 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine. To organize the work of aiding new persons to start, see the demonstration “Help New Ones to Preach.” All who conduct home Bible studies will find the suggestions very helpful in starting new ones in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> To reach our 196,650 goal in April we cannot wait until the month is almost over. No, we must start at the first of the month and work hard throughout the month. Each publisher will have to be ever conscious of and apply the slogan “each one help one.” By all working very hard, co-operating together in every respect and praying constantly for Jehovah’s blessing, we look forward to being able to report “We Made It I” at the end of April.</span></p></li></ul>

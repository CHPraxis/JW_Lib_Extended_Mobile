<p><span class="font2">To live “in (Joel’s will&quot; now means to have a part in His work of free education. God's will is that the time be redeemed or made good. Time lost in the past due to misuse is “bygone time” and nothing can be done about It now. However, understanding what the will of the Lord is, the time now and “the still remaining time&quot; can be made good or redeemed by living for the New-World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During July the June offer will be continued; that is, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘'The. Truth Shall Make You Free”. The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span><span class="font2"> will be taken to the people, such being offered on the contribution of 30c. To live “In God’s will . . . the still remaining time” you will take this offer to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the middle of July each publisher's Individual territory should have been thoroughly worked at least one time with this offer. Then, for the remainder of the month, in addition to starting over the second time, all diligence should be paid to back-calls. The offer’s being placed will have created the opening wedge for further contact, and, by tact and proper handling and application of help received through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font2"> the ones really interested can be shown the importance of study. Also, all new interest should be urged and assisted as far as possible to come to the nearest assembly point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention: Back-Call Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The back-call servant will give special attention to the interest recorded in the back-call files. He will check through both the permanent and the working files and make sure that every person showing interest is called on in July. Each established company book study</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">should be assigned the names in its territory, and the conductor of such study will see that they are properly called on. Certain nights should be set aside to take care of these back-calls. By giving this interest attention, properly and tactfully, additional book studies will result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">July should be a banner month in back-calls. A new back-call peak </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font2"> be reached. Do you know that it has been three years and nine months since the last peak? With the Assembly ahead each one should be spurred on with zeal and enthusiasm. If each publisher that has reported time this year were to report in July a peak in publishers as never before realized would result. Why not? Don't forget, advantage should be taken of July 4, since it is a national holiday. Let the proclaimers of real liberty, the ‘freedom wherewith Christ did make us free’, ‘proclaim liberty to all the inhabitants of the land' on this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Use your phonograph and the doorstep setup and the records you have on hand. Advertise with book leaflets, bookmarks and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Sen's,</span><span class="font2"> and thus make the people know your business. Young publishers out of school, spend all the time possible in the Lord’s service. Make July a month of real activity. Advertise and educate!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The test is on ! The day of decision is here! Show these lovers of truth and righteousness how they can “in God's will . . . live the still remaining time&quot;, not merely by being clean in thought, word and action, but by keeping Jehovah’s commandments to declare His name throughout the earth, engaging in each feature of the work of free education, and bearing testimony to the Kingdom of the New World. Why? you ask. “For sufficient is the bygone time to have wrought out tlie will of the nations.”—1 Pet. 4:2,3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">16 Cities in the United States Tied in with Key City</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is an assembly of the I,ord’s people, including all those interested in and in sympathy with Jehovah's</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">| new world. The preparation for it ■ and the carrying out of all its details are directed of Jehovah by his holy spirit or active force operating through his “faithful and wise servant”. Everyone who hopes for life in the New World is invited and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">j should be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">! The fact that old world problems, which are mounting every day, exist all around us is no excuse for the servant of the Lord to remain away from this table prepared by Jehovah in the midst of his enemies. Only knowing it is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fltc-&lt;lay</span><span class="font2"> assembly should stir everyone to attend and receive the Theocratic instruction and blessings. Yes, the event of vital importance and most momentous concern to every honest person of good-will is this United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly, with its public announcement “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”, which will be delivered by Brother Knorr, president of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, at 4 p.m. (E.W.T.) Sunday, August 13. This will undoubtedly contribute much to the , well-being of ail mankind, because it is directed of the Lord and is in entire accord with his provisions for bringing peace on earth to all men of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan to Assemble</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to assemble, with the Lord's people at some convention city and bring your good-will interest along. All those associated with companies of Jehovah's witnesses throughout the land, whether Kingdom publishers or not, should show themselves wholly for the New World now. Check your list of convention cities, ascertain the one you contemplate attending, and start making your arrangements now.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">However, there are problems to be considered, problems of transportation particularly. These should not be overlooked. Each one contemplating going any great distance to the Assembly should take the. precaution to have some time available at both ends of the Assembly, so that if the transportation facilities require it he can start a day or two earlier or stay a day or two later, as the circumstances may require. This in no sense indicates a lack of faith in the Lord, but is the exercise of the spirit of a sound mind, in view of existing conditions. Your faith is shown by assembling in spite of any difficulties that may appear unsurmountable from a human standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All should attend the Assembly prepared to serve as united announcers of the Kingdom of God and his Theocratic government. Announcing the Kingdom from door to door will be the principal field activity. Make the success of this assembly a matter of prayer before the Lord. Go to it in full anticipation of receiving the rich blessing of Jehovah, a blessing so Important to us all at this time. There is nothing you can possibly do from the 9th to the 13th of August that is so essential to your well-being as a Christian, nor anything as necessary for continued zealous service, as your accepting Jehovah’s provision in behalf of His faithful witnesses at this season by joining in the Assembly festivities.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A Big and Busy Month</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">As the giver of every good and perfect gift, Jehovah stands supreme. Among the greatest of his gifts is a knowledge and understanding of the truth that leads to life. He teaches all his children, and that without cost to them. In fact, none of his creatures could give anything of value to him in return for his gracious gifts, as he has need of nothing. However, he has arranged that his creatures can show their appreciation of the priceless education which they have received from him. How? By freely giving it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is what all of Jehovah's servants will be doing during the month of August: giving forth free education. In what manner? By offering the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shalt Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 30c, in the house-to-house work; by engaging in the magazine work; and particularly by making back-calls and conducting book studies. Yes, particularly by making back-calls and conducting book studies, for, in the strictest sense of the word, only at that point in our activity does fkee education really take hold. How so? When placing the literature with the people they usually make a contribution, and so they might not consider their obtaining the textbook as literally free; and then they may take the book and never read it, and therefore not receive any education. But when we call back and hold book studies with them we are educating them, and that at no cost whatever to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, during this month all educators will do their part so that (in the words of the text for the</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Attention!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Some misunderstanding has resulted from the statement appearing on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font2"> book folder: “You are invited to attend a study on this truth-telling book and also other meetings for consideration of life-giving knowledge and service at the Free Education Center at the address below and at the times given.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That does not mean that the name of the company headquarters, “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's witnesses,&quot; should be changed to “Free Education Center”. All company headquarters meeting places will continue to be known as Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The expression “Free Education Center” is merely used to emphasize to the people that it is at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's witnesses where they may receive free education concerning Jehovah's N e w World, and it is not instructing the brethren to change the names of their meeting places. When you stamp the address of your hall on the book folder underneath this invitation. you should show &quot;Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses” and then gi\e the address of the hall, so that the people may know where to go to receive this free education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only instances in which anything additional need appear to identify the Kingdom Hall is in large cities where there is more than one unit. Then you may show the name of your unit underneath the title “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's witnesses”.</span></p>

They will be diligent to make use of every opportunity to “sound down” into the ears of the people of good-will the life-giving truths so that these too may be able to take their stand for Jehovah and have a share in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Most Important</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let the world ridicule this campaign of free education as just so much of the “foolishness of preaching”. All of God's ministers know that it is the most important work being done at the present time. Nothing can compare with the truth in value. It alone brings comfort and peace of mind now; it alone can give hope of protection in the coming whirlwind of Armageddon; it alone offers the hope of everlasting life in the New World, a world free from wars and suffering, religion and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this month the United Announcers' Theocratic Assembly will be held. In making plans to attend let us not neglect our goodwill interest. Bather let each one arrange his affairs so as to be able to assist the greatest number of these to attend the assembly, and thus have a further share in extending free education to men of good-will. And, with five days of field service at one of the convention cities, this month should be a banner month as regards field service as well as of feasting at the Lord's table. Let each educator diligently work toward that end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In Lesson 43 the instruction talk “History of the Bible (2)” says: &quot;In 1881 the first edition of the English Revised Version was published, and in 1885 the American Standard Version was published.” This is an error, and has been corrected (since the release of the booklet) in the articles on “Presenting ‘This Gospel of the Kingdom<sup>-</sup> ”, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> The article in issue No. 640, March 29, 1944, correctly states: “On May 17 of the same year, 1881, the English Revised Version of the ‘New Testament’ was produced, the whole Bible being completed first in 1885. . . . Still later on, in 1901, the American Standard Version was published.” As the ministry course is repeated, when the instruction talk on Lesson 43 is given this correction should be incorporated in the talk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Society Has No Branch for the Blind</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently a letter was circulated throughout the country making a request for money and stating that the money should be sent to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Logansport, Ind. The letter stated that the money was to aid the ‘Blind Branch of the Society’. The Society does not have an office for the blind at Logansport. Ind. The request for funds to support this work for the blind was made without the knowledge of the Society. The facts are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On July 15, 1936, the president of the Society wrote the one handling the work for the blind that no further attempt would be made to print literature in Braille. Instructions were issued at that time that the material on hand should be used, debts paid, and the work be discontinued. Later in 1936 the 1937 | </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses </span><span class="font2">was published and on page 105. under the subheading “Blind”, this statement is made: “For some time the Society has maintained a small printing plant and depot for the benefit of the blind, at Logansport, Ind. There has been little progress in the work. . . . The opportunity for Jehovah’s witnesses in various places who can see and read is to read for those who are blinded and help them to understand the truth and comfort their hearts. Furthermore, the phonograph furnishes a means of testimony and they can hear In this manner. The interest manifested by the blind hardly seems to justify the continuing of this branch of the service, in view of the fact that they can receive the truth by having it read to them by others and by means of electrical transcription and phonograph machines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From that time forward the Society has not financially or otherwise supported work for the blind, nor has it directed the work that has been going on at Logansport, Ind. Some persons have continued to publish the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine and other publications in Braille at Logansport. They have done this work in the name of the Watch Tower, but not with the Watch Tower’s approval. Now someone has taken it upon himself to solicit money in the name of the Watch Tower for the support of this work. I This solicitation for money was made w’ithout authority from the Society and without the Society’s knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is the Society’s suggestion that blind persons interested in the truth be taken to the service meetings, book studies and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies and there receive the comforting message, as do all others of the j Lord's people. The blind should meet at the Kingdom Hall, just as the Greek, Polish, Italian and American brethren do, all at unity and working to the one end, namely, honoring the Lord’s name.</span></p>

The company stock Is the truth in printed form, and the sacred trust of properly caring for and dispensing it is committed into his hands. He will therefore be justly concerned in seeing that the literature is faithfully and zealously taken to the people, and will himself set a good example of diligent action in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The immediate question of how much stock should be on hand will be settled not by ordering huge supplies that cannot be handled by the company, neither by frugally refraining from having sufficient variety and amounts to meet the publishers’ needs. Careful ordering in 100-lb. shipments whenever possible will insure a balanced supply of literature. If an oversupply has accumulated, the Society regularly provides special campaigns to allow the companies opportunity to clean out such stock. Here is where the alert stock servant will in co-operation with all others in the compan; make a determined effort to taki the literature which certainly i: helping no one by remaining on th, shelves and see that those needing it are supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Aging, untidy, damp and dusty literature, carelessly and indifferently handled, is a reproach to a company; so the stock servant will, if possible, provide shelves and cupboards, etc., that can be locked and protected from dust and dampness. This will prevent deterioration and waste, and cause all those needing literature to come at certain specified times to obtain it. In this manner many company stock accounts will be better balanced. Extra supplies that must be left in cartons will also be kept from dust and dampness, and the contents itemized and marked on the cartons for easy counting and checking. Where the company stock servant needs aides these will be provided, and he will see that confusion does not exist by allowing everyone in the company to come and help himself with no record of such transactions kept. Record of all literature taken by the publishers will be kept on the Publisher's Order Blanks, totaled, and entered as the weekly movement of stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of the Progressive Inventory will enable the stock servant to know exactly how much stock is on hand, and its value. Where the amount of stock plus total cash on hand for literature, and value of literature held by publishers on credit equal the amount owed the Society, a healthy condition exists; but where the total value of stock and cash does not equal the amount owed, there is a deficit which should be remedied by the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The stock servant will see that all area book studies may have a small supply of literature, the book study conductor being responsible for its care. For all money that the stock servant turns in each week he will receive a credit memo from the accounts servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When shipments of literature are received from the Society an immediate check will be made, reporting any errors in invoicing or damage, so that a prompt adjustment can be made. An efficient stock servant will not stand idly by and watch stock accumulate and grow aged or unfit for use, nor watch the account become off balance and deficits mount. He cannot move the company's stock alone, but by the co-operation of all in the company such can be done.</span></p>

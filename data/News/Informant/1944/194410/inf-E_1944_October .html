<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Indications Point to Great Increase</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">October always witnesses an increase of activity in field service, and this year especially there is every reason to look for an effort that will indicate all-out action by more of God’s zealous and faithful sons than at any previous time. The blessings and benefits of the recent United Announcers' Theocratic Assembly will surely impel everyone to lay aside whatever has previously interfered with wholehearted action. The time of year, fall weather, is also ideal for energetic participation in all features of Kingdom service. Absence of concentrated and violent opposition in the field makes the situation much more favorable, and, lastly, the application of the picture provided in the title of the Testimony Period for October indicates that the time is ripe for total and unrestrained action by God’s people in welcoming ‘home’ those represented by tlie prodigal son. Shall anyone say these are not sufficient reasons for an optimistic outlook?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Practical Aid to the &quot;Prodigal” Class</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That which now causes those estranged from their Father’s home to return and join themselves to him is a realization from a knowledge of the truth that there is abundance and to spare in God's organization. The “elder son” class and those members of the “prodigal son” class already assembled, therefore, will gladly minister to such by bearing the truth to them and guiding them in the right way. October's activity, then, will feature participation in every branch of field service. Door-to-door work, back-calls and book studies, and advertising activity on the streets, will be in full swing. The literature presentation at the doors will be the combination so effectively employed during the last few months, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, Religion Heaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coining World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 30e. While being previously called upon, many have shown themselves to be tired of feeding on famine rations, and herding swine, and have desired to know how the truth can make them free. They have obtained the book, and now the opportunity is open to call upon them with the question booklet and show them how to study. Studies will thus be arranged for, and now the publisher, instead of merely engaging in door-to-door activity, will be branching out into the back-call and bookstudy activity. So many who just a few months ago felt that they were unable to conduct a study, by participation in the Course in Theocratic Ministry have now become able ministers, apt to teach, and are eager to share in this line of service. Many publishers do not have a study with someone of good-will. During October let every one of God’s favored sons who have already fed on his bountiful provisions make it a point to start a study with one of those who are hungering for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Additional Avenues of Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In isolated sections, and for those calling upon the newly interested, the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”</span><span class="font2"> may be used (in the event you have received your supply) as an additional means of nourishing the hungry. These two publications will be placed on a contribution of 25c. Completing the picture, and providing a full round of activity for every Kingdom servant, the street work with the magazines offers the final privilege. Thus the busy “elder son” class and their gathered “companions” can utilize every opportunity and spend all the time they wish in caring for the New World interests, and October opens the way for action in every branch of service now enjoyed by those of Jehovah’s household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Total Participation in October’s Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While attending conventions and caring for other matters many of God’s people have taken time out of service. It is good at times to thus turn aside from the heat of battle and come together for refreshment and a certain amount of rest. The entire body of zealous servants now appear fully prepared and ready for vigorous action. Certainly every one has fed upon the most gracious allowance of nourishing food ever provided by tlie Giver of every good gift, which has ‘renewed his strength like the eagle’s'. Prudent warriors have made all necessary preparation for the long fall and winter campaign. The organization has provided everything needful in the line of equipment and provisions for our warfare. Strong in tlie power of his might, the Lord’s people stand ready and fully equipped for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The field lies before us ‘white to harvest’ and the Lord of the harvest calls the laborers to action; for God’s army is not to set forward in a campaign of war and destruction, but, on the contrary, will go forth with a message of life and salvation to all who, like the “prodigal son”, are turning away from the old world and looking to the New World. The earnest entreaty of the father to the elder son to rejoice and welcome home the younger son indicates the proper attitude to be taken by all now enjoying God’s bounties, and surely none so favored will refuse to extend a hearty welcome to this class. October will provide the opportunity for everyone who claims to have a desire to aid the ‘prodigals’ to do so. It can be done by active participation in door-to-door work, making back-calls, building up book studies, and advertising on the streets. Conditions are good, and we have the equipment and the opportunity. Everything is in readiness for increase and prosperity!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Please remember that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> one-year subscriptions for the English </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> are $1.00 regardless of whether they are new or renewal subscriptions, and all six-month subscriptions are 50c. There is only one exception to this rule unless otherwise stated in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> about magazine subscription campaigns, and that exception is as follows: When the Society sends out notices of expired subscriptions, on the back of which notice it is stated that the party is entitled to a special offer of one year’s subscription and six colored-cover booklets of his choice for only one dollar. In this case the company should remit 75c, provided that the slip listing this special offer is filled out by the company and returned also.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Opportunities Never Greater</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Seek Ye First the Kingdom”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The above-quoted words of the Kingdom’s greatest pioneer, Christ Jesus, come in for serious meditation and consideration at this “time of the end”. To whom are they addressed? What does it mean to ‘seek first the kingdom’? and why is this the course of wisdom, especially now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not to religionists, but to all those who have manifested an earnest desire for the Kingdom, are these words addressed. Jesus, as a father to his children, was giving solemn admonition that would aid his followers to stand fast in their liberty as God’s servants; something that would, if heeded, enable them to resist the wiles of the Devil and remain within his household. Satan will, in the postwar era, make his greatest all-out effort to regiment every creature under himself, by one means or another. Every instrumentality will he use in an endeavor to entice the Kingdom publishers away from their God-given work; but we know that “this gospel of the kingdom </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">shall</span><span class="font2"> be preached”. Will you be a “preacher”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To ‘seek first the kingdom’ one must do more than attend meetings of the Lord's people. It means a conscious, positive, well-planned effort to care for Kingdom interests, looking always to Jehovah for help and guidance. Jesus showed how this might be done when he said: “Sell that ye have, and give alms.” (Luke 12:33) In other words, convert your time, effort and material goods into something that can be used unselfishly and to best advantage in feeding the Lord’s poor. The faithful pioneers have done this to the fullest extent, and their joys and blessings are many. They are busy in the Kingdom service, their minds and hearts are fixed on tlie Kingdom interests, and they are thereby pro-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Use No. 10 Bible for Field Distribution</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Society’s stock of the American Standard Version (No. 11) Bible is too limited at the present to fill all orders being received. However, we have a large stock of the King James (No. 10) Bible. Therefore, when companies or pioneers send in orders for Bibles to use for distribution in the field, the No. 10 Bible should be ordered and used. However, for your own personal copies and back-call work, we hope to be able to supply the No. 11 Bible as well as the No. 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">tected from many of the Devil's pitfalls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe there are many brethren throughout the country now doing good work as company publishers who can, if they carefully count the cost and arrange their affairs, enroll as full-time pioneers. It will not be done, however, without a conscious effort and earnest desire to ‘seek first the kingdom’. If this privilege is regarded in a routine manner and is not given prayerful consideration, of course you cannot expect to have Jehovah's aid in making pioneer service possible for you. Petition him for help, and look to him for opening the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Consider the Prospects</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you faithfully perform the duties of a pioneer over a period of time, you may be assigned to the special pioneer service. This, of course, means added responsibilities and privileges, but the Society will aid you to a greater extent in bearing these. After two years of fulltime service in seeking first the Kingdom, the opportunity may be yours of attending Gilead for specialized. Theocratic training. Then to foreign lands you may go to carry the “good news” to hitherto untouched fields, or to lands that have not had a good witness. It will not be the easy course, but it is a very blessed one. These are things to be considered, dear brethren, by all company publishers. Some of our brethren are enjoying these privileges now, because they heeded the admonition to “seek ye first the kingdom”. The way is still open and these opportunities may be yours. There is much work to be done. Can you enroll as a pioneer now and prepare for greater service? Many of you can if you heed the King’s call to </span><span class="font1">“SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM”.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Be Alert and Prepared</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The first Kingdom promise also foretold the war that would be waged between the ‘seed of the “woman” ’ and the ‘seed of the serpent’. That conflict lias now been going on for well-nigh six thousand years. As world leaders arrange for their “one world”, the issue between the two opposing forces becomes more sharply drawn than ever before, and Jehovah’s servants, because of their stand, become more and more conspicuous and the objects of attack by the proponents of that “one world” who would force all to give their allegiance to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It becomes, therefore, more and more necessary that all who have espoused Jehovah’s cause and given their allegiance to his Kingdom, in the words of the text of November, “be ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you.”—1 I’et. 3: 15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Young's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be “ready always for defense” we must, first of all, avail ourselves of the Course in Theocratic Ministry and all other means the Lord has provided so that we may be fully equipped with the whole armor of God. We must have the Scripturalness and the reasonableness of the gospel so clearly in mind as to be able to state it in a cogent and convincing manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, that is only the beginning. To be “ready always for defense” also means to be ever on the alert, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“instant</span><span class="font2"> in season, out of season,” so that we shall never miss an opportunity to speak in defense of the hope that is within us. We shall be ready, prepared, yes, eager to present strong arguments in defense of the stand we have taken, and to champion such a cause. And that means that we will not wait for opportunities to come to us, but that we will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">make</span><span class="font2"> opportunities to give an account of our hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How can we make such opportunities? Not by sitting at home and following the lines of least resistance. No! But by taking a bold, outspoken and uncompromising stand for the Kingdom, thus drawing the fire of the enemy and making it necessary for us to speak in defense of the truth. By regularly engaging in the house-to-house and back-call work, and by taking part in the magazine activity. By taking part in all features of the field service we shall make many, many opportunities to speak in defense of the gospel. During the month of November all Kingdom publishers will make such opportunities for themselves by going from house to house with the oiler of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;, </span><span class="font2">the colored-cover booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Heaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> and the selfcovered booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 30c. Where all territory has been covered several times with this offer, a combination of four booklets (one colored-cover and three self-covered booklets) may be presented, on a 10c contribution. Booklets used in this offer should be those released prior to the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the Yew World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theocratic Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Being ready for defense is a Theocratic requirement and is therefore not discretionary, but mandatory. In these days, when Caesar makes so many demands for that which belongs to Jehovah, His servants have many opportunities, when appearing I&gt;efore governing bodies and boards, to make a good defense for the truth. These opportunities must be squarely met and utilized to the fullest extent. And, by not following the religious, the commercial, and the political course </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> this world, the servant of Jehovah finds that he has still more opportunities to speak, and all such opportunities should be eagerly seized upon for the sake of giving a witness to Jehovah and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In fact, there is a threefold obligation resting upon each minister of Jehovah to be “ready always for defense”. First of all, our obligation to Jehovah, to take a bold and unequivocal stand for him and his kingdom. Then we have an obligation to our fellow men; they are entitled to know why we are Jehovah's witnesses ; we owe them an account of the hope that is within us. And, finally, only by being faithful to our commission, ready always for defense, shall we clear ourselves of responsibility for the destruction of the wicked. Should we neglect to do so, their blood will be upon our heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Men may challenge our right to speak in defense of our hope. They may want </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to deny the</span><span class="font2"> “stranger” his right to hear of this hope. But, having sanctified the Lord God in our hearts and made Him our fear and our dread, we shall be ready always for defense, regardless of what men may say or do. For we know that none can “legally” restrict anyone from doing that which Jehovah has commanded should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let all Kingdom publishers, therefore, during the month of November, make special efforts to be “ready always for defense” and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">make</span><span class="font2"> opportunities to give an account concerning the hope that is within them.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Years Supplies</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Study Report Letter</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Companies and pioneers found enclosed with their September </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> supplies for reporting and keeping record of their work for the coming year, and also a letter of instructions on how to report such activity to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reports coming in during the past year have indicated that some of the brethren, both companies and pioneers, do not fully understand how to report some features of their activity. That this may be straightened out, the letter of instructions on how to report should be thoroughly considered, first read and then discussed in detail with the brethren at a service meeting soon after the receipt of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Questions should be entertained from tlie floor and answered according to the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">General and special pioneers also have a letter on reporting with their year’s supplies. Each one of such should study this carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please note, when reporting back-call book studies and book-study attendance, that the number of “new interest” in attendance should never be less than the total number of book studies reported, because only studies where “new Interest” are in attendance are reported; thus in all cases there would be one or more in attendance at each study reported.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Brethren desiring Bibles and other literature sent to friends or relatives in prison </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">should not</span><span class="font2"> send their orders in to the Society.

<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Not Specifically Covered in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In a company of the Lord’s people, who should decide questions not covered by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions?</span><span class="font1"> The following scriptures cover this point: Acts 6 : 1-7 ; 15 : 1-29 ; Deuteronomy 1; 9-18. The course to be followed does not originate with the congregation or the multitude, but rather, the servant of God represented in the apostles, elders and Moses decided what course of action to take; because of their relationship to the Lord's organization they were the most responsible Theocratically. After they considered the matter, it was then submitted to the congregation for its consideration. It may be safely presumed that any beneficial suggestions made by the congregation would be embodied in the decision by the apostles and elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Procedure : Matters pertaining to service clearly outlined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Organization Instructions, Informant,</span><span class="font1"> etc., are to be adopted without being submitted to the congregation, because these constitute the Lord's direction to his people throughout the earth coming to them from Jehovah through his “faithful and wise servant’’. Matters not specifically covered in Theocratic instructions should first be carefully considered by the committee. Nothing should be submitted to the company for consideration and approval unless there is some good Theocratic reason for so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The committee should carefully and prayerfully weigh all the facts from a Theocratic standpoint, clearly prepare with Theocratic reasons for taking up the question, and then present these matters to the church, at which time it should be thrown open for discussion by the assembled brethren. Proper notes should be made of any suggestions that may be made in this discussion, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">brethren</span><span class="font1"> should be assured that these points will receive proper consideration by the committee. Then a resolution for the adoption of the matter may be entertained by the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this way the matter is handled Theocratically, the company has been properly considered, and any suggestions they may have on the matter have been given proper consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Legal Cases and Expenses Involved</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Legal cases are of two kinds. First, those that directly involve the witness work or preaching activity. These include those actions framed or brought for the purpose of stopping the Society's activity in a community and are those on which the Society has given advice in the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship. </span><span class="font1">While they are not the kind of company matters that should be submitted to the company for a vote as to what to do, the company and the Society are interested in the proper handling and fight of such cases. It is the privilege of each company to bear the burden of the expense in such cases. The brethren should not be assessed to bear such expense. Nor should the expense be put to a vote of the company. The amount of expense can be called to the attention of the brethren at any one of the regular meetings in order that those brethren of the company who are able and willing to contribute toward the cost of handling may do so. The servant should see that a special contribution box marked “Legal” is placed at a conspicuous and accessible place in the hall to receive any such donations. There should never be any solicitation, pleading or begging for legal funds. Contributions should be left entirely on a voluntary basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That everything may be done decently and in order, the accounts servant should handle these funds. Before any steps are taken in a case involving the witness work so as to incur large sums of money or a contract for lawyer’s fees, it is advisable to communicate with the Society's legal desk for advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Someone must determine on which of these cases these funds are to be expended. We believe that, generally speaking, the committee are the most mature and able brethren in the company and would be the logical ones to decide on</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">prison commissary. The Society cannot send packages to inmates without permission from the prison officials ; hence the inmate himself must order them through the proper channel. </span><span class="font1">the merit of such cases after conferring with the Society’s legal desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Assisting in Legal Cases Outside of the Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each company should bear its own burden by not calling upon or soliciting other companies for funds, near by or far away. There should be no district, zone, regional, or state legal fund organized by the brethren, companies, or servants, for the purpose of handling company cases. If a company is too small or too poor to bear its own burden, the Society should be consulted. If several companies get involved in a court battle with the enemy, then the matter of a joint fund can be submitted to the Society for advice and approval. Unless and until such approval is given the brethren should handle the cases that arise under such circumstances in the usual manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Personal Matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are other types of cases that are not Society or company obligations. These are all those that do not involve the witness work. The cases involving the brethren in their individual capacity and personal matters, such as divorce cases, child custody cases, husband and wife controversies, employment controversies, rationing boards, or other boards state or federal, etc., with which the company as such is not involved are not company matters. Such cases properly ought not to be brought before the company in the manner above indicated. Each brother or sister involved should bear his own burden. If any brother or sister thus involved obtains help from a friend or friends or relatives, the fund for handling the controversy is an individual matter with which the company and Society have no concern. This, of course, does not prohibit such brethren from seeking advice or counsel on personal matters from the elder or mature brethren of the company. Brethren in need of help as to their personal legal matters should not solicit from the brethren. The apostle Paul took care of his own burdens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Corporations</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From time to time it has been necessary for brethren in different areas or districts embracing more than one company to form a corporation in order to properly and legally carry on special features of the Kingdom service. This has been done with the full approval of the Society. In fact, the Lord’s organization being one functioning under the leadership of the present King, all such corporations should be operated only according to the counsel and direction of the Society. In conjunction with some of these corporations it was deemed advisable to recommend that the brethren in a district make contributions to the support and carrying out of said specific feature of the work. This arrangement was also approved by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, in some, if not all cases, the circumstances for which these assessments were approved have been entirely eliminated, such as the abandonment of Kingdom Schools and the need of contributions for that purpose, which no longer exists. However, some of the corporations still continue accepting and encouraging the contributions from the brethren for other purposes that are not approved by the Society. This should not be, and the Society feels that because the original arrangement was approved by the Society many of the brethren are still continuing to contribute to the present arrangement, believing that it has also been approved by the Society ; and for this reason this statement is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The corporations should not be dissolved nor become inactive, but may continue to exist and should function and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">operate completely and in</span><span class="font1"> entire accord with the Theocratic setup of the Lord's people upon the earth. Contributions from the brethren, except for the maintenance of the property owned by the said corporations, should not be solicited for any purpose without first submitting the entire setup to the Society for its approval and counsel. In cases where the company, as a congregation, operates and carries its funds in a bank account as a corporation, this is permissible. In many instances the property may be self-sustaining and hence there will be no need for contributions for maintenance of property.</span></p>

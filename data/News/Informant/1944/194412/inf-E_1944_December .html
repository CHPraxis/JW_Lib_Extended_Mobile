<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Grand Opportunities to Present New Book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The title of December’s Testimony Period definitely places special emphasis on the fact that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font4"> freedom prevails among God's people. No one devoted to Jehovah will neglect to avail himself of such freedom. This condition exists chiefly because the power of God exercised in behalf of his people has prevented the enemy from closing in on them, and. secondly, because His witnesses have zealously pressed ahead in using the privileges thus extended and have fought valiantly to maintain this favored position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The issue of loyalty to the New World or to the “present evil world” becomes more finely drawn each passing month, and the need of preserving the stranger's rights to learn the way to life becomes more urgent. Education of Jehovah’s servants to serve as willing and able ministers has equipped them for efficient performance, the organization of the Lord’s people for unrestrained activity is now highly developed, and the freedom to utilize all this lays the matter squarely before every individual as to his reaction. Can any fail or refuse to heed Christ’s commands to ‘preach this gospel of the Kingdom and teach all nations’ under the present prevailing conditions? The “Freedom Now I” Testimony Period provides the opportunity to meet this challenge in favor of wholehearted Kingdom activity, which activity includes the offering to all men of good will the way to real freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Gospel — New Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time eagerly looked forward to ever since the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly has now arrived. Every sincere announcer will greatly rejoice in the opportunity to present the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh,”,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of 25e, which is the offer for door-to-door activity during December. This makes all territory ‘new’, and the thrilling, soulstirring message presented in the current offer brings before all men their only hope and truly makes every bearer of the message a Kingdom ambassador in the fullest sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The month of December usually brings the brethren face to face with definite wintry conditions which, unless overcome, will curtail their participation in announcing the Kingdom. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> has stressed many times the need of properly dressing for winter activity. Of course, and above everything else, the will and determination to share in the &quot;Freedom Now !” Testimony Period regardless of any obstacle is what will result in continued or even increased service. Where the will to serve exists, the cold weather, the flat tire, the muddy roads, or any other hindrance, does not become an excuse to ease up and quit, but presents merely another obstacle to be overcome ; and from this angle the work for December opens up grand opportunities for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Feature Can Be Advanced</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of merely standing on a cold, wind-swept corner while engaging in the street work, the publisher will keep much warmer by-moving around, entering the stores, and talking to people in cars and on the streets, and thus be enabled to continue in this line of activity in spite of cold weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As far as back-call and book-study work is concerned the winter is the ideal time. People that in summertime might make the claim that they were busy with farm or garden work and wanted to be out of doors are now to be found in the house, and, as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> book is helpfully accompanied with a question booklet, wherever good interest is found it can be immediately developed and nourished by calling back and starting a book study. A fine opportunity now exists to call back upon those with whom studies may once have been held and who for one reason or another saw fit to discontinue them. Seed once planted may germinate and in time grow, and, if such people could not grasp the truth when first studied with them, perhaps the desire to learn has been stimulated by now, and surely no subject or presentation of the Scriptures could appeal to honest men more than that offered in the new book. Thus, in every feature of field activity, December’s offer and opportunities afford privileges and favors that must thrill every publisher both in anticipation and participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Breaking Away from Bondage</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wicked men have in many cases restrained the Lord’s people from freely serving him. This is bondage hard to be borne and causes much distress, but the most terrible bondage is that entered into by any of God’s people through negligence or indifference toward the Kingdom interests. Failure to be wholly submissive and willing to do the Lord’s bidding, and yielding to the demands of this evil old world, is a yoke of bondage that can and will be avoided by all those who now stand fast for freedom. The purpose of that ‘freedom wherewith Christ makes us free’ is shown in Isaiah 42:7, the monthly text for December: “To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.&quot; A glorious commission, everything needful provided in the way of literature and equipment, an army of willing and freedom-loving publishers who pledged themselves in the Resolution adopted at the United Announcers’ Assembly to carry on the present joyful work of announcing the Kingdom regardless of enemy action, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">freedom now</span><span class="font4"> in which to use the great privileges afforded. Such is the happy picture for December. Every free servant of God will gladly respond.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Infoi’mation on Singing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Many companies have written to the Society inquiring whether or not it is in harmony with instructions to sing at company meetings other than the service meeting. There is no objection to the brethren’s singing if they wish to sing before or after the meetings. However, the singing should in no wise take up any of the hour set aside for the meeting itself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Kingdom News” No. 14</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Again the Lord has furnished his Theocratic announcers of the evangel with another </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News: </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Overcoming Fear of What Is Coming upon the Earth.” What a timely and encouraging message! Clear and to the point, without false optimism, not mincing words but hewing to the line, it shows that though statesmen may profess that they have nothing to fear but fear, yet the very fact that they hold one conference after another and propose so many conflicting remedies speaks louder than words and gives proof that Jesus’ words are being fulfilled regarding ‘men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things that are coming upon the earth’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And that while men fear the threatening and uncertain future, those who have obtained a correct acquaintance with the truth and are living in harmony with it rejoice in such indications that the end of Satan’s world is near; for these know that this does not mean the end of the globe upon which they live, but the end of Satan’s demon rule and of his wicked organization on earth, and that in its place will be Jehovah’s government, orderly, righteous, and beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All territory is now virgin soil for this new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font4"> An effective way to cover it is: Each week, after completing the door-to-door work with the literature offer, cover with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> as much territory as one expects to cover the following week w’ith the literature presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be sure to have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> with you wherever you go, including the magazine work and on your back-calls, as well as in your regular house-to-house work. Also, as opportunities to give a witness arise while engaged in other pursuits. be prepared to leave a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> with them. The truth has helped us to overcome fear. Let us not withhold from the “stranger” his right to also overcome fear and to worship God and gain freedom. Leave a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> in every home at every opportunity.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Booklet Release</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society is pleased to announce the release of a new 32-page booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span><span class="font4"> A burning zeal of enthusiasm and desire to proclaim the heart-stirring message contained in the pages of this booklet will be yours as soon as you read it. More clearly than ever before, the sure and infallible promises of the New World ruled by the One Government, The Theocracy, are set forth, showing that such righteous rule is the certain destiny of all men of good-will. The booklet so plainly upsets the theories of postwar world-builders by laying alongside their plans the infallible purposes of the Creator of the One World, and His promises concerning that world and its government. The Kingdom and those ruled by that kingdom are put first and foremost. Indeed this message is the message of the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During February, this attractive 32-page self-covered booklet will be initially distributed, and will thereafter be pushed to the extent of 10 million copies. All companies and pioneers should send in their orders now for a supply of these booklets. Pioneers working with companies will please include their orders with the company’s. Please note that these orders will be filled in the order received by the office. There will be no special “rush” shipments of this publication. We will endeavor to have your supply in your hands by February 1, 1945, provided your orders are received immediately. Detailed information on the campaign will be given in a forthcoming issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> The important thing now is to order your supply.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Pioneers Are Needed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">It is impossible for the pioneer service to have too many workers. The opportunity for full-time service will, without doubt, remain open until the Devil’s outfit is finally trampled under the heel of Jehovah’s Theocracy, and all Kingdom publishers will then be full-time servants of Jehovah forever. As that final day approaches, the need for more and more pioneers increases in order that the good-will &quot;stranger” may fulfill the requirements of the Father’s household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has recently revealed to us through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> that the “strangers” of good-will are entitled to a share in the protection and blessings poured out upon Jehovah’s people. But first they must submit themselves wholly to the Lord’s organization and cooperate and wmrk peaceably and obediently with those whom the Lord is using to carry on his work in the earth.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Salvation by tl</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Nation-wide “Watt</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Unparalleled Public</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Salvation from what? and to what? And how can it be accomplished by the “'foolishness of preaching”? These are the questions that our January text brings to the fore in everyone's mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the whole world is governed by sin-spoiled, dying men more or less under the control of Satan and his demons. These men and nations are unable to extricate themselves from either their dying condition or from their evil demonic control. Among these men and nations there are millions of people of good-will whom the Lord purposes to save. He has made definite arrangements for their delivery from both the condition of death and demonic control by means of the “foolishness of preaching”. The testimony of the Lord’s Word on this point is: “This word [that is, salvation through Christ] is indeed foolishness to those who are perishing; but to those who are being saved, even to us, it is the power of God.” It is God's good pleasure through the “foolishness of preaching” to save them that believe. (1 Cor. 1: 18, 21; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott}</span><span class="font4"> “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” To his servant the Lord says. “I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will . . . give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these scriptures the Lord tells us what he is going to do in the way of bringing salvation to men of good-will, how he is going to do it, and whom he is going to use. Other scriptures clearly prove that associated with his servant are going to be a great many of the “other sheep” who have already escaped from demonic control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1945 &quot;Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This month of January will mark the start of the 1945 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign, and it is going to be for four months, so that every person in the country will have an opportunity to receive this message. The thrilling unfolding of prophecy in our day as revealed in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> makes that journal by far the most important instrument, outside of the Bible, for the edification of the people in the way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of the part that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font4"> plays in the purposes of Jehovah should be indelibly-inscribed in the heart and mind of every publisher so that he may present it with proper earnestness. The obtaining of a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> should be a “must” in the life of every person of goodwill who loves the Lord and desires to live under his Kingdom rule forever, and it is the duty and privilege of the publishers to present </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> so that each one witnessed to will appreciate to some degree the importance of its message. With </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtow&gt;er</span><span class="font4"> will be presented the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of one dollar. These two enlightening messages from the King establishing the fact of his presence and the grand Kingdom opportunities now within the reach of all men of good-will go hand in hand with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in directing all such to the ‘valley of Jehovah’s mountains’ prepared for their comfort and preservation. Where they</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">already have these publications, any other book or booklet may be offered. Let every- publisher go forward now proclaiming salvation by the “foolishness of preaching&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Country-wide</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing, however, is only a small part of the coming year's glories that Jehovah has in store for those who love him. During 1945 the 'foolishness of preaching by which the Lord will save those that believe’ will, by his grace, assume an intensity and magnitude never before realized by the Lord's people on this continent or any other place on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Commencing witli January a country-wide campaign of local public meetings will be put on by Gilead-trained and Theocratic-ministry-trained preachers. During the past two years the Lord has been training able ministers for this work now about to be inaugurated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> each company will receive eight sets of instructions covering this special nation-wide campaign for all company servants and the Theocratic ministry instructor; and each pioneer and special pioneer will receive one. These instructions are to be read and prayerfully considered and studied carefully at the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Speeches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The campaign calls for from four to six speeches (and in some instances eight), one on each successive Sunday for the period decided upon in every city, town, and hamlet where an audience can be assembled within every company, pioneer and special-pioneer territory. Pioneers and special pioneers working in a city where a company already exists will co-operate with that company. But all pioneers and special pioneers holding separate complete cities or isolated areas where such a witness can be put on should arrange for this series of meetings, provided competent brothers are available to put on the meeting. The large cities are to be subdivided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All servants in the company should come together immediately and consider these instructions and prepare for this new and great work. The subjects that will be used and the order of their presentation are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First meeting: “Will Man Succeed as a World-Builder?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Second meeting: “Escape Destruction in the Coming Crisis”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Third meeting: “Two Worlds in Final War”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fourth meeting: “A United World Under Theocratic Rule”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fifth meeting: “‘Thy Kingdom Come’ When?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sixth meeting: “Education for Life”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Bible Spotlight on Religion” “Religion’s Harvest”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where the public turnout warrants it and a series of eight meetings is put on, the two subjects at the bottom should be put on after the fifth meeting of the above series and conclude the series with number six.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An outline covering the points to be made in each speech will also be supplied by the Society. This outline should be followed closely, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to maintain good continuity. All speeches are complete in themselves. They are also so arranged that one opens the way for the one that fol-</span></p>

However, it will not be necessary for you to wait for the samples. Your orders for as many of these leaflets as you may require may be sent in immediately, showing how many you require for speech number one. number two, number three, etc. Be sure to give us the name and address of the hall, the name of the speaker, the date of the meeting, and the number of handbills required. Each order should be carefully checked by the company servant, territory servant, and advertising servant, to see that all information is correct. At least one month should be allowed from the time your order is sent in until you require the handbills. Give us more time if possible. Show on your monthly report to the Society the number of meetings held and total attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The kingdom of heaven is at hand, and this fact must now be made known to the countless millions who do not yet realize the great crisis impending. Those consecrated to the Lord and subject to the direction of the New World Government are obligated to see that this publicizing is properly done. Every publisher in the company and every person of good-will should engage in this new and great proclamation. Accept direction from those charged with the responsibility of preparing and executing the details of this campaign.</span></p>

Not only do they take their stand for the Lord, but they gladly comply with all the requirements placed upon Christians and joyfully take their place in the work of ‘discipllng all nations’, devoting all their time possible to the proclamation of the Kingdom at hand, either as good company publishers or in the blessed full-time pioneer service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The privilege of being full-time servants is not only for the remnant, but also for these “strangers” who are anxious to aid still others to join the ranks of those who sing praises to Jehovah. These must not be deprived of their rights and privileges offered them by the Lord; so the invitation to join the full-time pioneer ranks is extended to each one. The longer you postpone entering this branch of the service, the more blessings you miss. Are you keenly interested in the rights of these “strangers&quot;?

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Theocratic Ministry Instructor</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Must Be Apt and Able Minister</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Long ago Christ Jesus gave assurance to his brethren, as recorded in Luke 21 : 15, that they would be equipped to meet their adversaries without being gainsaid. The Theocratic ministry course is one of the chief means of so equipping the servants of the Lord; therefore the Theocratic ministry instructor will do all in his power to fully equip himself as an instructor. His aptitude and ability to Instruct and counsel will have much to do with the success or failure of the course in his particular company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Counsel and Co-operation of Students</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The advancement of the Kingdom interests and the preparation of the students to be properly fitted for that work is his first concern, and the brethren putting forth time and effort to improve themselves as able ministers can be greatly encouraged or discouraged by the manner in which their efforts are received and handled by the instructor. Disparagement of a student's efforts, indulging in personalities or partialities, will result in difficulties, and eventually a lack of Interest and an unwillingness on the part of the students to take their assignments. This would hinder the real purpose of the course. Where mistakes and failings appear they will be corrected solely from the angle of seeking to measure up to as high a standard as possible, and where an instructor gives evidence of knowing his duties and possessing the ability to help others advance he will gain the cooperation of all concerned, and the whole company will profit accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A library for the use of all in the company for reference purposes will be of great aid, and the instructor will encourage all in the use of it. He will likewise encourage everyone in the company, students and others, to make every effort to profit by the review of the lesson or instruction talk given in the previous week. The privilege of becoming able ministers extends to all in the company, and the ability to answer the review questions will show that the previous lesson has been learned and applied. Advanced students will be used by the instructor to give instruction talks, but the instructor will give all the needed counsel at all times. Counsel or criticism will not be asked of nor given by publishers attending the course; and for this reason the instructor must be thoroughly able and competent to aid and instruct the students in all features of the ministry course. The student giving the instruction talk on an occasion will, of course, conduct the review on such talk the following week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is not much good accomplished by dropping members off the roll, and such should not be done unless the student willingly absents himself and fails to share in the benefits of the course. These benefits are so essential and so much needed by every Theocratic minister that the real aim of the instructor will be to make the course so interesting and profitable that everyone will want to share in it and be very unwilling to be dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Co-operation between the instructor and the students and all in the company for the greatest good of all concerned is the goal; and where the spirit of the Lord is permitted to direct and guide the efforts there will be brought forth or developed from this course a united company of able ministers, meek and apt to teach, usable by Jehovah to His praise.</span></p>

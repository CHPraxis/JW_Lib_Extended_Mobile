</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Glorious Opportunity to Cast Off Bondage</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The issue of freedom to worship Almighty God or remain in bondage to the present evil world still persists. Jehovah, in the exercise of his loving-kindness, has brought his people to another year, and we find ourselves at the most eventful time of that year. Preserved by Jehovah’s almighty power and made free by Christ, opportunity now presents itself for every individual claiming any measure whatsoever of love toward God to make use of the present freedom and he found wholly worshiping Him by serving the interests of the Free Nation. Who, out of sheer gratitude, will avail himself of this privilege?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No text could be more appropriate than Galatians 5:1, reminding us that we have not been made free to become entangled again in the yoke of bondage of Satan's world. All restraining bonds and hindrances, then, will be cast aside by those who have been made free, that during the April Testimony Period no one will be idle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The week-end of April 8-9 will be set aside by all companies as a special period of activity, and should (if our freedom to worship is really appreciated) result in a peak number of publishers taking part in field activity. On Saturday evening April 8, many thousands of God’s people will assemble In commemoration of the Memorial. Proper reaction to Instruction received at that time will result in a peak of publishers by the evening of April 9. With such an early start, the month of April will provide excellent opportunity for the greatest number of publishers yet to engage in Kingdom service. Additionally, from the thousands of book studies that have been held countrywide by the Lord's servants, there must be many more now able to take the message of freedom to others. Last year 72,490 , lovers of freedom and righteousness availed themselves of freedom to worship God, establishing an all- i time peak of publishers. This year the Society hopes 80,000 will respond. Actually, there are many thousands more than this number that could be free and worship God by sharing in active service. The question must he decided individually. What will be the total response for 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer for April</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The continuing offer for April will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free’’</span><span class="font2"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Cominfl World liegeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a dollar contribution. Those who have been guided and built up by the freedom-giving truth from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> need no reminding as to Its worth and necessity. There may be a feeling among some, how. ever, that the “sheep” scattered abroad find </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> difficult to understand. Such is not the case. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is provided by the Lord to include all who are turning toward Zion for instruction, and, additionally, Jesus himself assures us that his “sheep” know his voice and will respond to the message when presented. If subscribers should have difficulty understanding some points set forth in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> then an excellent opportunity is afforded the Lord’s servants to study with them, and bring them to the headquarters’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchto w e r </span><span class="font2">study. Go over the list of subjects dealt with by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font2"> for one year and ask yourself how anyone wishing to be of the New World could afford to be without the knowledge there set forth. Believing in its vital necessity, let all God’s people faithfully advance its presentation. Further, let them aid all receiving it to understand its glad message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a further provision to enlighten men of good-will who are unable to take the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font2"> subscription combination, the offer of a bound book and the new booklet will be presented to them by the publishers. Surely a “feast of fat things” has been set by our great Provider. All are invited to the feast; all who will live need this nourishment to survive the famine conditions of this old world. Where the entire offer cannot be left with the people, try to place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and the new booklet on a contribution of 25c. Where tins is not possible, then try to have every home where there is any interest whatsoever learn of their hope for life in the New World by reading </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone In Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All new publishers wishing to share in freedom of worship by active service, go to the company servant. Ask for Testimony cards and all other aids for field activity. Let all companies be fully prepared to attain peak activity during April. All servants', take the lead as good examples to the (lock, co-operate with the study conductors in aiding as many as will to serve. All regular publishers, see what you can do to aid the Irregular ones. Where new ones wish to join in the glad work, give them a helping hand: take them with you. Show those studying with you the opportunity of association. All necessary equipment has been provided by God’s organization. The great King grants freedom of worship. All willing hearts will take up the opportunity. April. 1944, by Jehovah's grace, will be the greatest time of activity yet seen by his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Will you share in the forward </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MOVEMENT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again the monthly message to the Lord's people to consider pioneer activity has been read and dealt with at the company service meeting. Again the question presents itself, &quot;How have I responded?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hindrances and obstacles that prevent many from taking part in the pioneer service were shown in the letter to be surmountable. The pioneer life is not an easy one; all contemplating taking it up will first sit down and count the cost; but the joyful fact in the whole matter is, it is a happy life and the faithful pioneer servant will be sustained. Perseverance, faith and trust in the great Provider make it possible. You can be a pioneer; not in your own strength, but by God’s help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The educational angle is also set forth in the letter as being an inducement to take up full-time activity. The peace of mind and inward joy are also dealt with. Over 180 have enrolled between February 15 and March 15. With Satan’s world offering nothing but misery and final death, and God’s new world extending the opportunity of life by fully serving its interests, why longer delay?</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention, Company, Stock, and Advertising Servants, and Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A number of companies and pioneers that do not have a magazine account witli the Society are ordering magazines and expecting to receive them at the rate of 2Jc per copy. The new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List</span><span class="font2"> recently sent to all companies and pioneers i makes the way to order very clear, and it would be well for all to study It and the policy outlined therein very carefully. All pioneers and companies that do not have magazine accounts are required to pay the regular rate of 5c per issue for all copies individually ordered direct from the Society. If you can order as many as ten copies of each issue of file magazines (in the case of pioneers, ten in addition to the seven regularly consigned to them), then as a pioneer or a company we can open an account with you here. If you are unable to use as many as ten copies, then it is suggested that you subscribe for five or more issues to one address at the rate of 65c a year for each subscription. Pioneers working in company territory should order their copies through the company if the company has a magazine account; and thus obtain them at 2-1c per copy and at the same time save much work at headquarters. If you do not find it possible to open an account or subscribe for five or more issues at the special rate or obtain your copies through a company (if a pioneer), then the regular billing of 5c per copy will be made for all copies ordered.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Progress of “Watchtower” Campaign</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Subscriptions Pouring in by the Thousands!!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All expectations have been shattered ! Although we have had some excellent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaigns in the past several years, none of them have come anywhere near the present one. We are thrilled to announce that 46,044 new subscriptions were received in this office for the United States alone from February 1 to March 10, which is nearly one-half of the quota of the entire campaign. We are now two-thirds through the campaign and each day the mail is heavily laden with more subscriptions to be entered. The country as a whole is keeping up with its quota very well. Have you reached your quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Greatest “Watchtower” Campaign in History</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In comparison with last year’s campaign, we now have several thousand more subscriptions for the same period of time. This stupendous increase has been made despite gasoline rationing, bad weather, restrictions, travel difficulties, and many other inconveniences. The brethren this year have the advantage of the Theocratic ministry training, greater appreciation of their part in the free-education work, and a greater determination to overcome all barriers to advance the Kingdom interests. Naturally, this tremendous influx in a few weeks taxes the capacity of the office here. Therefore, if the subscribers do not receive their copies as soon as anticipated, explain the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Great has been the joy of Jehovah’s people as they have gone forth during this campaign. Keep up the good work during April, and let’s make it the top month of the campaign.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>On Reporting Memorial</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">That we may have an accurate report of the Memorial celebration from all companies throughout the country, please observe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">carefully </span><span class="font2">the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As soon as this is read, the company servant should set aside one “Company Monthly Report Card” for April. Mark on the card </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">now, </span><span class="font2">in the lower left-hand corner, the following words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Number in attendance __________”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Number partaking &nbsp;.................”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to arrange for the counting of the total attendance and the number of different ones partaking of the emblems. Get this information right after the Memorial and enter it on the report card in the proper space. Retain this card until the end of April, and fill in the regular field service report for that month thereon, no later than May 3, and forward to this office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Teach All Nations”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribute Surplus ColoredCover Booklets in May</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the words and acts of our Lord while on earth were words and acts of unselfishness, love for his neighbor. His purpose was to bear witness to his Father's supremacy, and teach and instruct the people concerning Jehovah's purposes. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">He set the</span><span class="font2"> example as to how the free-education work is to be done. His parting words addressed to his disciples just prior to ascending into heaven make up our service text theme for May: “Ho ye therefore, and teach all nations, . . . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” Thus, the direct application of oneself to the teaching work was made to stand out as of major importance. That work is now being pressed to the fore, and during May it continues. There is a very great quantity of colored-cover booklets on hand throughout the country, and these contain “tilings whatsoever I [the Lord] have commanded you”. To ‘teach all nations these things' will require the direct personal application of all devoted to the Lord's work. Preparatory details for the May activity follow. Complete details will be found in the May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Combination Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer will be three booklets on a 10c contribution. In each combination one booklet will lie </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World liegeneration.</span><span class="font2"> Stress colored-cover booklets, and if your supply of such is large make up the combination of two colored-cover booklets and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration.</span><span class="font2"> Distribute your largest surplus first. If you run short of colored-cover booklets, drop to one colored-cover, one self-covered (of which you have a surplus), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration;</span><span class="font2"> or, if completely out of colored-cover booklets, leave two surplus self-covered ones and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> on the 10c contribution. By all means leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> if no combination can be placed, and leave it on a small contribution or just on their promise to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Check with Neighboring Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some companies will probably not have sufficient booklets to use during the campaign. If such is the case, before ordering from the Society contact your neighboring company or companies and check to see if they have enough to supply your needs and their own also. If they do have sufficient for your company, arrange to obtain a supply from them for use in May. Pay cash for these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you cannot obtain a supply from a company, order from the Society. The booklets that we can supply, listed in the order of their quantity,are : </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy; Warning; Choosing; Dividing the People; His Vengeance; His Works; Supremacy; Final War; Angels;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People. </span><span class="font2">Stress </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> on all orders, as we have a large supply of these. Remember, however, the work for May is primarily a distribution of surplus colored-cover booklet stock </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">already on hand in the companies.</span><span class="font2"> Order from headquarters only after you have ascertained the status locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Individual publishers with surplus quantities of booklets on their personal book shelf should distribute these during May. If you have sufficient to supply your needs, notify the stock servant for his information. Everyone should now begin getting ready.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Course Necessary for All Able Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companies that took up the Theocratic ministry course immediately following the “Call to Action” Assembly in April, 1943, will have completed their 52 lessons in April of this year. The number of companies that actually got their course under way in April, 1943, however, is comparatively small, and when they have completed their 52 lessons they may conduct one or two reviews on some subject of their own choosing pending additional information from the Society on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is also a good time to review some of the benefits derived from the conscientious study and application of the course in Theocratic ministry during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unquestionably all companies and individuals that have sincerely applied themselves to it can observe many benefits over and above those referred to here. When the course began some of the brethren considered this arrangement was just the thing for all others, but not for themselves. The brethren who were not able to speak the English language fluently thought it was not for them ; whereas, in truth and in fact, these were the very brethren who would derive the greatest benefit from it. This was amply demonstrated by the many foreign-speaking brethren who took it up. It was only a short while until they could think more clearly and express themselves more fluently in the English language, and thus they became more able ministers of the gospel. The course in Theocratic ministry is indispensable to those brethren who do not speak the English language fluently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other brethren who were timid and backward and felt they could never get up before an audience and speak thought this course was not for them. But the facts soon demonstrated to those who availed themselves of this provision that the course was the very thing they</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Introducing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 13 and New Book Folder</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From Jehovah’s inexhaustible supply house comes two more effective tools for the Theocratic ambassador to use in his warfare against religion. and two more items on the menu of spiritual food for those of good-will: namely, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Keirs </span><span class="font2">No. 13 and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> book folder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All companies and pioneers may order a supply of these immediately (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List</span><span class="font2"> for rates). The new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font2"> No. 13, is to be distributed In advance in the manner outlined in the November, 1942, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> in the article “The Use of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News”,</span><span class="font2"> so that every home in the territory will be sure to get at least one copy of this new inspiring and instructive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">entitled “Education for Life in the New World”. The distribution of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> will afford all the new publishers and people of good-will a splendid opportunity to get started in the service. Distribute this issue freely in your own individual territories. Arrange to cover all unassigned territories by group witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One book folder also should be left in each home. Be sure to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neatly </span><span class="font2">stamp thereon the address of the local headquarters and the times of the various meetings. The next week follow through with the regular </span><span class="font3">offer of literature. </span><span class="font2">needed. And as a result some of our most capable servants in companies now are those very brethren who were afraid to get on their feet and express themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even the “speakers” who thought the course was just for beginners and not for them shortly found out that those very beginners were presenting much more instructive and Theocratic talks than the brethren long in the truth were. These younger brethren had their talks properly arranged with a good introduction, a well-thought-out and ably-presented body, and a convincing conclusion, which many of the “speakers” lacked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Applicable to Every Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The course in Theocratic ministry is for every company, large and small, and for every individual in the company, regardless of how old or how young he may be. The sisters are greatly benefited by attending the meetings and studying the instruction lessons and comparing their findings with those of the speaker and by participating in the subsequent discussion of the material. Small companies composed of all sisters or of sisters and only one brother should also assemble for Theocratic ministry study each week. Even though they may not have any speaking assignments the instruction lesson should be taken up. The course in Theocratic ministry is the Lord’s provision for all of his people so that they may be more able ministers of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">February Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Carefully considering the February report, which was the first month of the current </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">Campaign, we note a slight increase in hours over last year’s report. The pioneer activity, however, shows up splendidly in both hours and back-calls: hours, 152.7; back-calls, 44.4. Conditions in the United States give our publishers many advantages over other lands. Keep up the good work!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Account System</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren will hail with delight the provision by the Society of a detailed folder of information that will enable the companies everywhere to follow a unified system of keeping the various company accounts. Two copies of this four-page folder are being sent to all companies, one for the company servant and the other for the accounts servant, so that they may go over the situation together and put the system into operation right away. The stock servant, advertising servant, auditor, and all other servants affected by this arrangement, should have access to the company servant's copy and should copy such portions of it as apply to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Complete illustrations appear in tlie folder as to how each account will be kept, thereby eliminating all guesswork and providing for a uniform system to be used by every company. Companies that heretofore have had difficulty in keeping their accounts in proper order will be </span><span class="font3">especially benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Assistant Company Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In co-operation with the company servant, the assistant company servant has an excellent opportunity to aid and direct the company toward a condition of unity and efficient operation in Kingdom service. Essentially, then, the assistant company servant should be able to take over all duties of the company serv-■ ant, be capable and duly qualified to handle the affairs of the company in the absence of the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The co-operation between these two brethren, therefore, must he very close, resulting in mutual agreement and action. The assistant company servant will strive for neatness, accuracy and proper order in all his records, having this end in view. Efficient and up-to-date records are necessary for a progressive and diligent service unit. The converse also is true: where no attempt is made to maintain proper records, slackness and looseness are evident in the field activity. Substitution of other forms than those provided by the Society is unnecessary and only results in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In small companies where there are only two servants, the assistant company servant will co-operate with the company servant, each performing his assigned duties as shown on the Society’s appointment sheet. This includes making territory assignments, caring for supplies of literature, magazines, and sound equipment, or looking after accounts and back-calls. In large companies the assistant company servant may need some aid in properly caring for the company records. In all companies, when handling </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions he will see that the Subscription Record sheet is properly filled out and sent in with the subscription blanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Assisting Other Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By completely filling out the Publisher’s Record cards, the monthly breakdown of study conductors’ monthly reports, and the monthly record of company activity, the assistant company servant has at his finger tips an exact knowledge of the company’s condition. Where laxity appears in any particular line of activity, he is able in co-operation with all the other servants of the company to stress these points and find the remedy therefor. He will also watch for individual ability as indicated by the different publishers’ field reports, seeing to it that active and zealous publishers are considered for use in various capacities in the company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assistant company servant will be able to furnish necessary information to all other servants of the company for the proper functioning of their duties. If a publisher holds a territory without working it properly, this information is conveyed to the territory servant for action. Likewise where the records show failure to advance the back-call, book-study, or any other feature of service, the assistant company servant is able to lay the facts as they exist before the various servants for correction. All servants, therefore, by having access to the assistant company servant’s files, will be able to keep their respective line of service in the best possible condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus the assistant company servant holds a position that may be used to great good for the entire company. The Lord’s blessing is upon orderliness and cleanliness as expressed in efficient prompt recording. Prosperity will attend faithfulness in this line; carelessness will result in a corresponding laxity in company </span><span class="font3">activity.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>House-to-House Work Backbone of Field Activity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Our calendar for September directs our attention to the Course in Theocratic Ministry. “Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.”—Prov. 9:9. As called to our attention at the recent Assembly, our big job as ministers is to preach the gospel from house to house, place literature, and call back and endeavor to aid those who have received the literature in their study of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Provided?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is just for this very work that the Course in Theocratic Ministry was provided by the Lord. Many are inclined to take a much too narrow view of it, seeing only what appears at the weekly study meeting, and fail to associate with it its real purpose. Yes, to limit one’s conception of it thus is to miss the point of the course entirely, which is not merely to develop a handful of platform speakers, but to make every one of Jehovah’s servants, old and young, male and female, more able ministers in the field service. And to realize this purpose we must make conscious, diligent and consistent efforts to apply in our field service the lessons learned in the ministry course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the House-to-House Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First of ail, in our house-to-house presentation. As records wear out and new publishers join the ranks who are unable to procure phonographs it becomes more and more imperative that we start right. During the month of September we shall continue to present the offer of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make 'You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> the colored-cover booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirhcind, </span><span class="font2">and the self-covered booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 30c. In presenting the Kingdom message at the door we will be as careful as if we were on the platform addressing a company or a unit. We will endeavor to have poise, greet the householder with a smile, and in a relaxed and conversational tone state the purpose of our call, having definitely in mind what we intend to say for our opening sentence. As we note the response of our “audience” we will use Theocratic tactfulness, presenting Scriptural arguments and logic in such a manner as to help them to see the truth and make it easy for them to let go of error. Thus we demonstrate that we are “apt to teach”. Should they show a contrary spirit, we will not lose control of our spirit, our mental disposition, but will endeavor ‘in patience to teacli those that oppose themselves’. If, try as we may, we have been unable to make our point, and we depart without seeing any tangible result of our efforts, we will immediately reflect on our manner of handling the situation and try to see where, either in what we said or how we said it, we could have done better, and will make a mental note of it for the next such instance. Doing thus, our presentation will become more and more effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Easily Discouraged or Sidetracked</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because we have been repeatedly counseled not to get into heated and long-winded arguments with those whom we meet at the door, some have gone to the other extreme of following the line of least resistance by accepting every expression of indifference or opposition as final. Instead, here again we should use what we have learned in the course regarding arousing interest and tactfully overcoming opposition. The question form of Introduction is a good one to use in such cases, doing this in meekness, and in a kind and sincere tone of voice, “a soft answer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Failure to follow such a course of action has caused some to become discouraged in the house-to-house work, who, as a result, are now limiting their activity to the street magazine-work. This is a big mistake ! The house-to-house work lays the foundation for the back-call and book-study work, and is the ideal method for approaching the people. It is the real hand-to-hand grappling with the enemy, and, while the most strenuous, it is also the most stimulating and holds the most surprises for the publisher, as every house is a question mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In Back-Calls and at Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same, of course, applies to the making of back-calls and the conducting of book studies, only much more. Here again we must be relaxed and manifest a friendly, sincere and meek disposition. As able ministers we will be well equipped as to the doctrines of the Bible, be well acquainted with our Bibles, and know how to find the information needed in either Theocratic or non-Theocratlc helps. And especially should we have the subject matter well in mind and be able to show the connection between the scriptures cited or quoted and the argument being presented. We will have looked up all unfamiliar words so as to know their meaning and how they should be pronounced. Thus fully knowing whereof we speak, we shall instill confidence into those whom we are endeavoring to teach that what we present is indeed the truth; for we shall be teaching with authority and not as the religionists. Doing thus, we shall be making full proof of our ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Releases Our New Weapons</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The joyful expression on the lips of all Theocratic announcers, after attending this year's Assembly, is “What a convention!” The themes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">there developed still ring through our minds: Seek ye first the Kingdom ! This gospel of the Kingdom must be preached! The kingdom of God is nigh! While thus rejoicing and giving thanks to Jehovah for the many blessings received the sober question presents itself: “What shall I do now to faithfully fulfill my commission in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the main purposes of the convention, of course, was to imbue God’s people with an absolute and wholehearted appreciation of the importance of the Kingdom, their responsibility of discharging their commission as its announcers, and of enduring faithfully for it. The Resolution adopted on the afternoon of August 12, after the stirring presentation of our necessity to preach the gospel of the Kingdom, puts every consecrated servant of God as definitely committed to an unswerving course of faithful activity in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This Resolution also clearly shows that, in spite of any postwar attempts of the old world to hinder such activity, God’s zealous servants will maintain integrity and never slack in preaching this gospel down to the end of Satan’s visible organization. As demonstrated during the session entitled “Faithful Endurance for the Kingdom”, some of God’s faithful remnant have served more than fifty years in Kingdom activity, and still are not tired or pining to leave the scene of service. If these are eager to continue in the fight until and through Armageddon, shall their companions, who have served comparatively few years, grow lax just because it may be a few more years than they onee thought?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications for Our Aid as Announcers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lasting aids and provisions were brought forth at the Assembly to enable the Lord’s people to fulfill their preaching commission. The first was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Service Song Book.</span><span class="font2"> The opportunity to now make melody in our own hearts, and to sing the songs of Zion in unison, will greatly aid in efficient singing of the Song of Moses and the Lamb in field activity. The new songbook is Theocratic throughout, no sad melodies, no religious words, no creature worship, but entirely Kingdom service and praise to Jehovah. Who have more cause for joy and singing than Jehovah's servants? For this reason the release of the songbook was hailed with great joy, and all now rejoice in this gracious gift from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thursday was devoted to field-service features, and, appropriately at its close, our choicest instrument yet, for use in our ministry, the Watchtower edition of the American Standard Version Bible, was released. Yes, due to the Course in Theocratic Ministry, Jehovah’s ministers were becoming more and more “version”- and “translation”-minded. No longer were they content merely to quote from the popular King James version; but if another more modern translation expressed the thought better, it was used. What could be more fitting, therefore, than that one of the best, if not the best, of modern versions of the Bible should now be published by the Society? It is a version that puts the name of Jehovah where it belongs: in the foreground as the most prominent name of the Hebrew Scriptures. With its boldface type, its freedom from archaisms in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, and its comprehensive 95-page cyclopedic concordance, it certainly will prove to be the most valuable instrument Jehovah’s ministers have yet received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Campaign Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saturday afternoon was the occasion of another grand surprise when the bound book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font2"> was released, and all present who understood and were in favor of the Resolution there passed were each given a free copy. The teaching of the Kingdom being the paramount Bible theme, how valuable a work which traces that theme through the many pages of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation ! In a style that is a happy combination of beautiful and forceful Scriptural idiom and pointed modern expressions, it traces the Theocratic theme from the “first Kingdom promise” to the time when “Jehovah reigns” as undisputed ruler of the universe. What an instrument to revel in, to equip us to better preach this gospel of the Kingdom, and then to pass on to others! And so that no time might be lost in aiding each one to study this book, the Question booklet for it was released the same day, in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Diligent Field Service Will Result</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sunday afternoon saw the final release when, at the end of the forceful delivery of the masterful argument in behalf of the announcement “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”, the booklet containing the lecture was distributed free to all in attendance. Pulling no punches, it exposes to all the folly of world rulers, political and religious, who presume to do that which only God’s kingdom can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Returning home from the Assembly, the Lord’s servants find themselves faced with the necessity of pressing on in individual action against many foes, difficult conditions, and various obstacles. However, fully supplied now with ample spiritual food, possessed of a complete array of service and field equipment, and filled to overflowing with gratitude for these bounties from our heavenly Father, all will remove every obstacle, ‘sell all that they have,’ so that everything may now be devoted to the Kingdom service.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Place New Releases with </span><span class="font3">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">All proclaimers of Kingdom truth will joyfully engage in the service of the Kingdom during October by having a large share in taking to the “prodigal son” class the truths the Lord has for them. This class recognizes that the food and wages of the old world bring only starvation and deatli and that the reward for New World service is life in its abundance. Those who have been ‘feeding swine’ in old world slavery long for something better, cleaner, finer, something enduring. Their Father, Jehovah, has such, and as publishers of Jehovah’s Kingdom the obligation rests on you to aid them to fully realize their position and “wake up” and humbly come to their Father in the appointed way. How does He receive them? The Scripture text cited in the 1944 Service Calendar for October answers: “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”—Luke 15: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Use in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During October the distribution will in most companies be the same as for the preceding months: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a 30c contribution. As announced elsewhere, the Society will not be able to supply every company in the I</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The New Songbook</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">One of the many choice instruments received at the recent Assembly was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Service Song Book.</span><span class="font2"> As announced at the time of its release, the singing of Kingdom service songs will be a regular feature accompanying the weekly service meeting; one song to be sung immediately </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font2"> and one song immediately </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font2"> the service meeting hour. Note that tliis is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not included</span><span class="font2"> in the hour, or sixty minutes, of service meeting. The meeting will then be closed with prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The songbook can be had on 10c contribution. Cash with orders. We have some of these in stock and will fill orders as well as we can. We do not think, however, that we have sufficient at the present time to fill all the orders that will come through, as we are having difficulty in getting the necessary materials. Therefore orders should be conservative. Those who wish to use the songbook at home can carry it to the meeting and use it there also. In some instances it may be necessary for two brethren to use one songbook between them. Let all enter into this literal singing of praise to Jehovah with the whole heart and “with understanding”.'—Psalm 47: 6, 7.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Make Progress at Book Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Book studies should not lag. They should be lively and interesting. Studies in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> should continue until finished, before starting in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To finish a study of the book within a reasonable period of time, this procedure should be followed by all conductors of book studies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All those attending the study should, during the week, carefully study the eight to ten pages of the book to be studied at the meeting. They should consider thoroughly the questions asked in the booklet, and look up every Scripture text cited, both in the paragraph Itself and in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Study Questions</span><span class="font2"> booklet, and</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">country with sufficient of the new literature to have an extensive campaign with it in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, those companies that do receive the new book and booklet should waste no time in distributing it among the back-calls and studies and all Interest in the back-call file. That will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. Many companies took home with them a goodly supply of the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”,</span><span class="font2"> and this can be used in the evening booklet work and left with all who will read it, on a contribution if possible, but if not, then on the promise to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October, by God’s grace, will be a grand month for field activity. Expressions from publishers indicate that they realize the responsibility and seriousness of their covenant with the Lord more fully since saying “Aye” to the resolution on Saturday of the convention. They are determined to press forward as regular publishers, not just “regular” in the sense of publishing one time a month, as much as one hour, but regular each day and each week in some feature of Kingdom activity, engaging in all features during the month. Make such your determination also, if you have not already done so, and go forward never to stop in the proclamation that the Kingdom is at hand and the king-</span><span class="font3">I </span><span class="font2">dom of God is nigh.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Use the Watchtower ‘Theocratic’ Edition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">At the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly Brother Knorr announced that “one of the field blessings and privileges that Kingdom publishers will have the pleasure of enjoying henceforth is to distribute the new Watchtower edition of the American Standard Version of the Bible printed on the Watchtower presses at Brooklyn, N. Y.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This new publication is undoubtedly in the hands of all the publishers everywhere by now, and you have been able to prove for yourself that this authoritative modern translation of the Bible ranks among the best, if not the best, of modern English versions of the Bible. A copy of it should be in the hands of every consecrated servant of the Lord, not only for its superior text but also for its Theocratic cyclopedic Concordance and maps, which make it Indispensable to the Theocratic ministry student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are having difficulty in getting sufficient material to have a large supply of these on hand, but we shall fill orders for these as rapidly as we are able and shall print as many as we can. Therefore, orders for this Bible should be conservative, so that the limited supply available will go as far as possible. Good-will interest should be supplied with a copy, but we do not yet have sufficient stock to put on an extensive public campaign with this Bible. The rate to the company will be $1.20, and it will be placed with the public for $1.50.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">At the study, the conductor will propound the question and entertain comments. Following, he will have someone read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">only the first</span><span class="font2"> scripture cited after each question, to be followed by a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font2"> comment by the reader applying the scripture to the subject. In this manner eight to ten pages each week can be covered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom is at hand I The King reigns! How do you know? What is the basis for your faith? How can you prove this conclusively to persons of good-will? Never had there been so clear and plain a coverage of this controversial subject. The claimed ‘contradictions’ in the genealogy and chronology as to early typical kings, and of the reigning King, are ironed out and the truth of God's Word stands vindicated. But wait; that is not all. Woven around this is a coverage of the Kingdom from its first promise, pictures foreshadowing it, laying of the foundation, and its proclamation in the last days. Following, there is a consideration of the cumulative evidence, brielly put, yet so abundant and overwhelming as to ‘disciple all nations’ where that is possible. This has been captured and confined to but 370 pages of the latest book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> released at the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly. For your reference work, there has been provided a subject index as well as a Scripture text index. Head it, and then rejoice in the glorious treasure of taking it to others as your instrument in making clear to all the Kingdom, which is Jehovah's master instrument in vindicating his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our New Campaign Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many publishers and good-will are blessed by having a copy of this book. However, material restrictions and shipping difficulties will not make it feasible to have a thorough campaign of distribution of this book in October. It is expected that sufficient supplies will be printed, shipped, and In the hands of all companies and pioneers to have a thorough campaign beginning in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The book will not be consigned. Each company and pioneer should ascertain just how much of this literature will be required for a threemonth period of activity, keeping in mind that December is the special campaign. Send in your orders now, and they will be filled as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The campaign begins in December. However, many companies will have a supply of the books before then, perhaps some little while before. For those so situated it will be all right to begin distribution of this with the newly interested ones whose names are on the back-call file or are attending book studies. These should have opportunity to obtain the book. Also, prior to December, if you are working outlying rurals that will be inaccessible for several months to come, and have the new literature, you may place the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font2"> and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> with any desiring it. This prior distribution should not at all detract from the December campaign, but rather be a means of clearing the decks and preparing the way for many people of good-will to join with you in tliis December campaign, and thus provide for a full, all-out and combined effort beginning December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have a fairly large supply of the special “Publisher’s Edition” of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> which is available to any publisher who did not receive his copy, and for those who desire copies for their back-call and book studies. Any desiring these, company publishers or pioneers, may order a few at the straight rate of 25c each. We should like to get this edition out now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Take to the field. Obey the simple and impressive expression of the King, as he stands pointing the way to all, “Go, disciple all the nations.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Advertising Servant</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Because one of the basic operations of God’s visible organization is the advertising of His Kingdom, the advertising servant occupies the position of aiding the entire company in this respect, (1) by being himself an exemplary and zealous advertiser and (2) by arranging all affairs and matters of this nature so that everyone in the company may operate to the greatest advantage as efficient advertisers of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the sound-machine activity has been somewhat hindered by world conditions, there still remain thousands of phonographs and records that may be used. The advertising servant will diligently strive to have all in the company realize the value of this line of activity and put the phonographs to effective use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through demonstrations in the service meetings tlie advertising servant, with others in the company, can show how to properly employ the phonograph in the door-to-door work, and also how to bring the recorded lectures to people as part of the educational or back-call work so vital now. This will necessitate the careful attention of the advertising servant in seeing to it that all broken records are deleted and replaced as far as possible, and that by the company's having a good variety of records on hand those willing to hear<sup>-</sup> may be given the benefit of listening to many subjects for their instruction. The Society’s Sound Equipment Record form will be used to keep track of records or equipment borrowed and returned by the various publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A zealous advertising servant will, of course, be in the forefront of magazine activity, diligently advancing the continuous use of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> Complete organization is very necessary in this connection, so that all in the company may enthusiastically engage in street-corner work, distributing magazines from store to store, building up routes for regular ob-tainers, and using magazines in the field distribution. Every publisher will be encouraged to use the magazines to the utmost, registering as magazine publishers, and ordering a steady supply of each issue, and using these regularly so that they will not accumulate. Territories for street-corner and store-to-store activity will be issued by the advertising servant. He will also watch carefully to regulate the supply of magazines to the needs of the company, and by seeing that regular monthly remittances are made by the company servant the magazine account will be kept in proper order and not be allowed to build up a deficit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Advertising Agencies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bookmarks, book folders and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> are also of vital need in advertising, and the advertising servant will see that all publishers can obtain an ample supply that they may freely use in covering their territories. If a company is still able to use a sound-car or transcription machine, the advertising servant will direct the use thereof. Kingdom Halls and billboards offer other possibilities for advertising too. An attractive display in the windows of a Kingdom Hall may be worked out between the company servant and advertising servant, and, by changing the display once a month, much can be accomplished in directing the attention of the people to the Kingdom message. A faithful advertising servant occupies a position that may be used greatly to the benefit of the entire company in fulfilling their advertising commission.</span></p>

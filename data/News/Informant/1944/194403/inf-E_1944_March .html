<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Subscriptions Pouring In</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">March, promising to be very favorable from the weather standpoint in many sections of the country, opens up the second month of the current </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign. According to the way the subscriptions are coming in at headquarters, this will Tie the greatest campaign of “free education” by New World ambassadors yet. Everywhere the brethren are talking subscriptions. Many have well exceeded their quota. Did you reach your quota for February?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize for Daily Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The text for March, as shown on the 1944 Watchtower Service Calendar, is, “And </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">daily</span><span class="font3"> in the temple, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in every house,</span><span class="font3"> they </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ceased not </span><span class="font3">to teach and preach.” (Acts 5:42) How clearly the present work of New World ambassadors is outlined in that text! “Daily” and “in every house” the Lord Jesus and his followers, the apostles, “ceased not” to care for the interests of the people of good-will by ‘teaching’ them and ‘preaching’ to them. They did this in spite of the fact that they were not equipped with modern-day effective instruments such as we have at our disposal. Their difficulties were many. But they “ceased not”. Are you permitting the ‘winter’ to cause you to cease?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer Continues the Same</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As faithful New World ambassadors to the homes of the people, our work for March is to continue to keep to the fore the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtouer </span><span class="font3">magazine at the regular subscription rate of $1.00 a year and give as a premium the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free’’</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font3"> to all subscribers. The- importance of placing this combination in every home cannot be overstated. Of course, if they have already obtained the latest book and booklet, any book and self-covered booklet may be placed with the year’s subscription. Go prepared for such opportunities. Bear in mind also that all surplus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font3"> booklets should be placed with the people, so as to lie ready with a “clean slate” for the April work, outlined elsewhere in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Instruments Convince</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people of good-will want </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> whether they realize that fact or not. There are many that are ‘seeking after the Lord if haply they might find Him’, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will lead them to Him. Our work, then, is to convince these people, in a Theocratic manner, that they need </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> This is done, not by arguments at the doors, for that accomplishes nothing, but by using Theocratic instruments, and, furthermore, Theocratic tact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One instrument that should be stressed by all is the phonograph. If used correctly, it will ‘put across’ the full import of the message to these good-will people. Use it in your door-to-door and back-call work. The obligation rests on the servants in the company to take the lead in the use of this instrument. Advertising servants, check your company’s supply of records and phonographs and get these to work in the territory. Take inventory of records, and put to use all of them that can be used for presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another thing to remember is to put into use the help gained by your participation in the course in Theocratic ministry. Use Theocratic tact. Many people, actually of good-will toward the Lord, say “Not interested” when you call at their door. In order that you may relieve them of a wrong impression of your mission, you might state words to this effect: “I know you are not interested in peddlers, agents, and the like. However, I am not a peddler, but I am an ordained minister and I am here to interest you in the truth.” Thus you tactfully break down initial prejudice and have an opening to step inside out of the chilly air, or to play the phonograph on the step, weather and listener permitting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another Instrument provided by the Lord for the ‘teaching and preaching’ work is the Question booklet. By this time you will have placed a number of bound books during February with the people in your individual territory. Your obligation now is to call back on these with the Question booklet on the book placed and tactfully direct their attention to the importance and vital need of a study. By doing this, taking a kindly initiative with the people, many studies will be started, and soon these people will see the need of subscribing for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font3"> thus, more subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this time all companies will have had one or two demonstrations at the service meetings on various methods of presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Those brethren (brothers and sisters) who have been successful in obtaining subscriptions should be encouraged to demonstrate, as realistically as possible to the brethren in attendance, how they do it. Having two or three brethren on the program in this way will give the publishers many helpful suggestions on how to properly go forth as New World ambassadors and uphold the dignity and interests of their Government, The Theocracy. Make these demonstrations interesting and constructive, but do not try to put on a “show” or be merely entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">March, 35,000 Subscriptions? Yes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Begin now to personally organize for more New World warfare. Call on every house in your individual territory. If you don’t have a territory, check with the territory servant and get one. Let’s obtain at least 35,000 subscriptions for March. Strive for your individual quota. Why not a peak in publishers and</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A New </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cost List</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> is a new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List;</span><span class="font3"> one for each pioneer and three for each company (one for the company servant and one each for the accounts servant and stock servant). The company servant’s copy should be accessible to all other servants and any other publishers who may have occasion to refer to it from time to time. The first four pages of this booklet contain important instructions on how to order, and should be studied thoroughly by the stock servant and company servant particularly, and by any other brethren who have to do with the ordering and receiving of the stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some changes in the rates, particularly on English booklets and foreign books and booklets; therefore the stock servant and all the brethren working in the stockroom should immediately familiarize themselves with these new rates. These rates go into effect as of February 1, 1944. Companies, when figuring the value of their stock in the future, should figure it on the basis of the new rates. We believe the increase accruing to the company as a result of the change of rates on the 64-page self-covered booklet will about offset the decrease resulting from the change of rates on color-covered booklets and foreign literature, and will thus obviate the need of trying to maintain two sets of accounts covering the literature now on hand and that received in the future.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>February Pioneer Letter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Monthly, now, the Lord has been pleased to bring us encouraging messages in the form of pioneer letters, setting before us the benefits of leaving the entanglements of this present evil world, and, with full trust in Jehovah, living wholly for his new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The February letter having been read and considered, adding its weight of testimony to that of all the previous admonitions, additional reasons are set before us for action as regards full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With spring on the way, and all the advantages of warmer weather calling to us to throw off any remaining shackles, the time was never more propitious than now in which to become God’s free and unburdened servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are pleased to be able to tell you that 70 new pioneers have enrolled in Jehovah’s full-time army of freemen during the first two weeks of February. Fully counting the cost, and being assured that you can meet full-time service requirements. the time for action presents itself now as outlined in the February pioneer letter. Have you considered the move?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">book studies? Maintain your position as a New World ambassador to the homes of the people by supporting fully the interests and purpose of that righteous Government, ‘ceasing not to teach and preach.’ To do such is your commission, &quot;until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man,&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Open General Pioneer Territory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">We are listing, below, sixty counties in a total of twelve states ranging from Virginia and West Virginia to Florida and west to Texas that have not been worked since 1940, some not having been fully covered at that time. Along with those counties listed in the January and February issues of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> as open for general pioneer assignment, these listed below present an additional opportunity for general pioneers to effectively use their 150 hours or more a month in assisting the people of goodwill who know substantially little or nothing about the Kingdom, due to our inability in the past to fully attend to their needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you are planning on entering the pioneer work now, or in the near future, and are in position to go to isolated territory, make your request for first, second and third choice of these counties on your pioneer application blank, and, if open, we shall be glad to assign such to you. Many of these counties have towns of from two or three hundred to three thousand population that are in urgent need of attention, and the greater part of your effort can thus be spent in the urban or thickly settled sections.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Every servant and publisher should carefully study that portion of the 1944 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> treating “Production”, pages 48 to 51, with the following points in mind: the great goodness of Jehovah in providing the necessary material despite unprecedented difficulties, the dependence of the witness work upon production, and the dependence of production upon field distribution, and the Lord's wise direction in coordinating these two branches of the service in unity to accomplish his ultimate purpose of providing free education for men of good-will. It is well for the brethren everywhere to realize the intimate relationship that must exist between all branches of the Lord’s organization. A qualified brother should be assigned the privilege of preparing a constructive and enlightening 15-minute service talk on this subject during one of the service meetings in March.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Freedom of Worship” Testimony Period</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Final Month of</span></h4>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Right at the time when there is much talk about a postwar peace by worldly authorities and other people interested in world affairs, which peace they hope will bring about the long-hoped-for “four freedoms”, the Lord provides liis people with the “Freedom of Worship” Testimony Period. This gives a real opportunity for ail sincere Christians to worship God in spirit and in truth. Christians have been made free to worship Jehovah God, and are strongly admonished by the apostle Paul to “stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage” (Gal. 5:1); or, as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font3"> translation puts it, “In the freedom with which Christ made us free, therefore, stand you firm, and do not again be held fast in a yoke of servitude.” Having been freed by Christ in order to worship God, the servant of the Lord will diligently maintain that liberty by using it as the Lord directs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">April has promise of being the best month of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign. By that time every company publisher, pioneer, and special pioneer publisher should have two-thirds of ills entire quota. If not, then a special effort should be put forth this month to make it up. April will have several advantages over the previous two months. By April the weather will be much better and it will be possible to reach outlying towns with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> offer. The Memorial will be held April 8, and the brethren everywhere should prepare to spend at least that entire week-end in the Lord’s service as a proper manifestation of their faith in his promises. Also, the school children and many brethren having secular employment will be free during the “Easter holidays” to engage in the service. This so-called “holiday” period is being used by Satan and his religious organizations to defame the name and purposes of Jehovah God, and the true servant of the Lord will not be satisfied unless he is using this time to magnify the name and purposes of Jehovah and to ‘comfort all that mourn’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Subscribers, Take Notice!</span></h2>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>“Change of Address” Slip for Subscribers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is pleased to introduce a “Change of Address” slip which should be used by all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscribers who move or change their address. We are enclosing six of these slips with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> This slip should be filled out clearly and completely and sent in to this office at least two or three weeks in advance, so that the magazines will be sent to the new address and none of the issues go to the wrong address. This will save the Society much time, extra work, and expense. It will be all right for you to send in this “Change of Address&quot; slip several weeks in advance and mark thereon the date that you expect to move, and this will further insure your getting every copy. Be sure to mark clearly whether it is for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> or for both, and if in a foreign language: also print both the old address and the new address clearly and completely. As much care should be used in filling out this form as in making out a subscription slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All companies should have a sup-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Care of the Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has cleared the way for a great witness to be given by removing many of the obstacles that confronted the publishers in the past. Through many court victories Jehovah’s witnesses’ full right to preach the gospel without interference is admitted in this land. Many of the brethren are able to get enough gas to care for the Kingdom interests in the outlying urban territory at least. This is particularly true of the company servant and assistant company servant, and, of course, any gas received for Kingdom service should be used exclusively for that purpose. In other cases the Lord has arranged for each one to hold an individual territory near his own home, so that transportation is no difficulty. The Society is now able to supply the brethren with all the current literature they need. Prepare to cover all your outlying towns that were not covered during the first two months of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign. Be sure to go back to those who were not at home when you called previously, and offer them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Call back on all those who were busy, and those who did take either books or booklets but did not give a subscription, and give them another opportunity to subscribe after investigating the matter further. Search out every home in your territory that has not had the offer. Make a thorough gleaning job of it. Keep in mind, also, that you will have a new booklet to Include in your presentation during April. Keep a record of all the interest you find and be sure to follow it up in the weeks and months to come. Many of these people will be anxious to have studies started with them and the publisher will be practicing his “freedom of worship” faithfully by starting as many studies as possible with all these people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer in April</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The offer in April will be the year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> a bound book, and the latest booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font3"> all on a contribution of $1.00. Let us all arrange to make April a fitting climax to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign by zealously utilizing our freedom of worship.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>New Booklet Released</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Coming World Regeneration</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Always far in advance of evil men, whose ways and thoughts are shrouded in the darkness of this dying world, our great King, with full knowledge of his ultimate triumph over wickedness and death, now brings forward a glowing hope for distressed and dying men in the clear revelation of his ultimate purpose for men of good-will, as contained in a new booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This timely and comforting message will be gladly hailed by all the Lord’s people as a valuable stimulus and powerful force in equipping them for full participation in the coming “Freedom of Worship” Testimony Period. It will enable them to leave a fresh and up-to-date message even in that territory that not long ago may have been covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklet to Be Consigned</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The consignments of this booklet to the country at large will average 50 per publisher, but each company’s allotment will vary, depending on how recent placements have been in its particular territory. Pioneers will be favored with approximately 300 copies each. Thus all will have the joyful opportunity of being equipped to leave this hopeful message in every home where interest is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The front cover of the booklet depicts that gladdening scene which stirred the heart of faithful Noah more than 4,000 years ago, when, looking over the watery wmstes that covered the depopulated first world, he beheld Jehovah’s token of hope, peace, and life, the gentle dove bearing in her beak the olive leaf, as evidence that the destroying floodwaters had abated and the earth would once more support life. The old order had given way and a period of reconstruction was imminent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The booklet assures us that, contrary to the false teachings of religionists, the resurrection of Christ Jesus did not give birth to a new world order and begin a restoration and renewal of the whole world, but rather the resurrection of Jehovah’s great King sealed the doom of the present world when the regeneration becomes due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message of this booklet brings, at once, a condemnation of Jehovah’s enemies, and a bright hope to those distressed humans who are sighing and crying for the abominations done in the old world of wickedness. It is of the utmost importance to those who hope to be regenerated. Thus all publishers may readily see the need of diligent and active distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All faithful publishers will therefore be eagerly awaiting and anxious to share in the distribution of the new booklet, as it not only will stimulate action for the Freedom of Worship campaign, but will provide excellent opportunity to see that every home where interest exists has a further opportunity to know of world regeneration and boldly stand for that incoming New World. It is to be released to the public on April 1, the beginning of the “Freedom of Worship” Testimony Period, and will be included in the current presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for one year and a bound book, all three for a $1.00 contribution. Where any other portion of this combination cannot be placed, a real effort should be made to leave this booklet in every home where promise is made to read it, even though no contribution is possible. The new rates shown in the recently released </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List</span><span class="font3"> will apply to this booklet.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Company Servant</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">As a duly appointed representative of the Society to promote the Kingdom service activity in his respective area, the first concern of the company servant is the formation of a smooth-working, unified organization of all servants and publishers in the territory assigned. This is brought about by diligent discussion and application of all instructions and advice sent from headquarters, proper use of ail forms provided, and complete enlightenment of all servants of the company as to their respective duties. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and all other instructions from the Society will therefore be thoroughly studied, the company servant assigning to each of the other servants those portions of instruction dealing with his particular branch of service. Thorough and careful preparation in advance of presentation will insure proper instruction, and diligent application of the knowledge provided will result in unity and oneness of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To enable the servants of the company to be fully conversant with their duties, the Society provides a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions </span><span class="font3">for each one. The company servant will see that each servant is given his copy. Where a servant has difficulty in understanding what he has to do, the company servant is obligated to aid him in acquiring the proper knowledge. Likewise, when a servant needs assistance, the company servant will provide such by appointing one or more assistants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the internal machinery now fully set up and running smoothly, the company servant turns his attention to things in the field. A healthy company, paced by servants who take the lead, will lie found diligent in field service. The reports should come not only at the end of the month, but, by constant reminding by the company servant if necessary, as soon as possible after the service is performed in the field. Thus by the 15th of the month the company servant through his assistants can ascertain those not yet active and promptly assist these to overcome their obstacles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By the end of the month a healthy company will have put forth a good effort, and the company servant will be ready to promptly send the report of this activity in to the Society. He will also see that it is posted on the company monthly record sheet by weekly entries, and displayed before the company on the company chart as soon as the monthly report is compiled. Now the weak and the strong points of the company will appear, and the company servant will enlist the help of the whole company in building up those features that are weak and maintaining those that are strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this connection the company servant will rally the support of the other servants and all the bookstudy conductors, to bear before the company at all meetings those points that must be strengthened. Good, interesting and well-prepared meetings mean good attendance, whicli in turn means good enlightenment and favorable reaction by diligence in field service. The company servant will aim for a clean, well-kept hall, free from numerous distracting signs, but displaying the posters and charts provided by the Society. Kind consideration of all attending meetings, particularly the new good-will interest, and helpful instruction through all channels provided by headquarters, will resuit in peace, unity, and diligent action in the field.</span></p>

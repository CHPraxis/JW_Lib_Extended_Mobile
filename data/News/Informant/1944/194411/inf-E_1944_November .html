</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Be a Defender of the Gospel by Being a Publisher</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God has granted all publishers of The Theocracy freedom to worship Him. This freedom is secured to them alone and apart from all peoples. Worldly authorities attempt through mischievous laws to regulate, restrict and control their worship. The issue of God’s law or “Caesar’s” law comes to the fore, requiring the fighting witnesses of Jehovah to be “ready always for defense” of the gospel and their right to preach it, as well as the right of misinformed millions to hear the Kingdom evangel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be “ready always for defense” of this freedom to worship Jehovah requires that one be a user of that freedom for the intended purpose, namely, worship. This worship is rendered in the form of service in the field, Kingdom service in all its features. Thus, the primary requisite is to be a Kingdom publisher, an active ‘true worshiper’ of the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be at all times ready to defend this right to serve God requires, too, that the publisher be vigilant and continually prepare himself to meet, resist, cope with and push back opposition to his worship that is designed to push him off from proper performance of his commission to preach the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As will be observed, the service poster for November, headed by the words “Ready Always for Defense”, illustrates a Theocratic publisher making his defense before the court concerning the Kingdom and his right to preach its gospel. He has made himself “ready always for defense” of his hope and his Godgiven right of freedom to worship God prior to this time. He has made a thorough study and has a good working knowledge of the procedure as outlined in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of</span><span class="font4"> Worship booklet, and he is applying it rightly here. He has a comprehensive knowledge of Kingdom truths through diligent study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> and other communications from the Society, the Lord’s instrument on earth. However, it is not his knowledge of these things that brings him into court. No; it is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">application of</span><span class="font4"> this knowledge by actual worship, house-to-house preaching of the Kingdom evangel. His constant devotion to this service work in all its features is his worship, and it is this that he is defending. Through this constant devotion, study and application of knowledge gained through study, he has prepared himself, and made himself &quot;ready always for defense” of freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, it is not only in the courts of “Caesar” that the free worshiper of God must make a defense. In his daily activity, constantly, he is always ready to defend his right to preach the gospel. When in the house-to-house work he finds opportunities arise constantly to make defense of the truth. In back-calls and book studies he has the opportunity to explain the truth of the gospel and defend it against religious lies that have for years stumbled the good-will people. By constantly keeping on the watch for privileges of service, and being “ready always for defense” of these privileges of service, he maintains his position of freedom to worship God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">November’s Equipment for Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">November will complete the regular offer of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> and the two booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of 30c. This will mean that six months will have been afforded to get this vital information into the hands of the people. Most individual territories will have been covered fully with this presentation. However, the reports to the Society indicate that there is still much territory throughout the country in company assignments : isolated sections and “undesirable” territories that are accessible, and that need to be covered with the above offer. This will afford the opportunity to clear out any surplus stock of the above three publications in preparation for the December activity. All publishers not holding individual territories are urged to get into this group work and assist in getting this territory covered and the people of good-will reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Alternative Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For those publishers and companies who have fully worked their territory with the above offer, an alternative offer is provided. This will be made up of one colored-cover booklet and three self-covered booklets released prior to the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World.</span><span class="font4"> This combination will be presented on a 10c contribution. This too will afford companies and pioneers the opportunity to clear out any surplus stock they might have of these booklets and get them into the hands of the people where they will accomplish their purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By continually engaging in preaching freedom and fighting off all attacks to prevent you from doing this work, not only will you maintain your right to worship God but you will maintain the right of “strangers” to hear this message and you will have the opportunity to present the truth that will wipe away the misrepresentation of religion that has so long confused and blinded them. Also, you will defend your position of strength as a Kingdom publisher by ‘studying to show yourself approved’ and thus “be ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you.” (1 Pet. 3:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young’s)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Consider Your Privileges</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus laid down the Father’s policy for judging his people when he said that they would be judged by His word in the last days. This undoubtedly has reference to the revealed word brought forth for our guidance now. Recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font4"> on ‘The Holy Spirit’, “The King’s Marriage Feast,” and “Organized for Final Work”, clearly reveal the Lord’s requirements and bring forcibly to our attention the principles the Lord uses in judging his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He invites those who wish to engage in his service faithfully to do so. Some joyfully accept, and receive his favor and blessing; others, burdened with the cares of this life, reject his gracious invitation. This was true of the anointed as outlined in “The King’s Marriage Feast”. Some refused to accept the invitation. Others accepted the invitation but refused to put on the wedding garment, that is, to faithfully and joyfully do the Lord's work as he directs. Self-examination by each one enables him to see where he stands in this judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jonadabs are undergoing a similar test. They are to wash their robes in the “blood of the Lamb”, and to manifest their appreciation of the Lord’s goodness toward them by ‘standing before the throne</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consider the Field</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">There are almost 60 counties in the southern part of the United States that contain a population of 50 percent or more colored people. Neither the white nor the colored in this territory have been witnessed to since the dates shown. Some of this territory goes as far back as 1935. There are undoubtedly people of good-will in these counties to whom the Lord's people are obligated to carry the Kingdom message. Pioneer brethren are the ones upon whom this responsibility rests particularly. We would ask all of them, therefore, to seriously consider this matter, and, those pioneers desiring an assignment to any of these counties shown, please write the Society immediately for an assignment, stating a first, second, and third choice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All of these pictures come to a climax in our day. The King has come and is examining the guests and also the bride's companions. All are under surveillance. The principles of the Lord do not change. He extends his invitation to his people, both anointed and Jonadabs, to faithfully discharge the obligation of publishing his name and purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Count the Cost”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rather than just ‘counting the cost’ in terms of pleasures, comforts and conveniences to be sacrificed, and the hardships of pioneer life, consider above all the rich blessings, enjoyable experiences, and joy in the Lord’s service and receiving of his approval that might be lost if you don’t become a pioneer. Ask yourself, “Can I afford to pay the price?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For those brethren who are now in position to meet the pioneer requirement of 150 hours a month and other features of the pioneer service in proportion there is awaiting their request an Application for Pioneer Service in the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn 1, N. Y. Write for it.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Campaign for December</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Wisely Use Your Freedom by Preaching</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Freedom now ! What good tidings for tlie meek! Good news for men of good-will held prisoners by Satan’s organization, and who long for freedom from sin and selfishness, from superstition and religion. Yes, Jehovah, as the God of Freedom and the Free is today, now, offering this freedom to all lovers of righteousness, to all men of goodwill toward him. And by what does he make men free? By means of the truth; for ‘’the truth shall make you free”. To this end he is causing a world-wide campaign of education in freedom-giving truth to be carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To carry on this campaign he has commissioned all of his servants today, the only ones who are free in the true sense of the word, to “preach good tidings unto tlie meek”, to “bring out the prisoners from the prison&quot;, to proclaim “freedom now”. In fact, that is the very purpose for which they were set free: to preach freedom. And their continuance as free men depends upon their asserting their freedom by preaching this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To this end Jehovah has arranged the “Freedom Now!” Testimony Period for the month of December, and has furnished us with two new instruments, the bound book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand’’</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Sigh&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> which will be offered to all during this campaign on a contribution of 25c. What a hope-inspiring message they contain! With clearness and beauty they show the Kingdom to be the main theme of the Bible, tracing it from Genesis to Revelation, and giving cogent proof that the Kingdom is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">here. </span><span class="font4">That is why freedom exists and can be offered to the people </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font4"> By the time this campaign begins more than three months will have passed since we received these instruments at the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly, and by which time all should be thoroughly familiar with their contents and filled with a keen desire to bring them to others. Let us, therefore, begin this campaign with an impetus of zeal and enthusiasm that will carry us through the entire month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So that this campaign may get off to a proper start, however, it is also necessary that all preparations be made ahead of time. Sufficient stock should be on hand, so that there will be no slowing up because of lack of literature; all territories should be checked, so that those being worked may be renewed if due, and those being neglected be turned in for others to work. The back-call files should be carefully examined, and all whose names appear therein should be given an opportunity to obtain the new literature at once, and also to join in offering freedom to men of good-will. This activity could be very well worked in with the group back-call work on the company's back-call night. Arrangements should also be made for group house-to-house witnessing, particularly for the benefit of new and irregular publishers. In making plans it should be borne in mind that December brings cold weather with it, and therefore may somewhat circumscribe our activity. However, the righteous requirements of Jehovah’s organization remain the same, regardless of the time of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We still have our quotas as special pioneer publishers, general pioneers, or company publishers, and therefore all will put forth diligent efforts to overcome this winter-weather obstacle instead of permitting it to overcome them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All territories are virgin soil for this new offer. Go over the territory carefully, taking time to note the result of each call on the House to House Record form; calling back at some other time of the day or week to contact all not-at-homes. , Territory cannot be considered completely witnessed to even once, until </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font4"> home has had the opportunity to accept or reject the message of “Freedom Now”. As interest is found and literature is placed, this should be noted, and back-calls made upon all such; for it is necessary not only to plant the seed but also to water it. Therefore call back and stimulate their appreciation of the message they have received. Place the question booklet with them and show them its value and how to use it, thus working toward a book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor will we preach “freedom now” only from house to house, at the doors and in the homes of the people, but all Theocratic publishers during December will also engage in the magazine work, on the street and from store to store. And while engaged in this work they will always carry with them a copy of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> and several copies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is ' High”, so</span><span class="font4"> as to be able to make the most of every opportunity that comes their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Resolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of the release of the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> a resolution was made and adopted and all who accepted the spirit of that resolution were given a free copy of the book. That resolution clearly showed that the Kingdom has been established; that tlie nations have had the Kingdom gospel preached to them and that they have chosen to ignore it; that they are going ahead with their own scheme for world rule; that Jehovah’s servants have given their allegiance to Jehovah’s kingdom; that the command to preach </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">this </span><span class="font4">gospel of the Kingdom still holds; and that they will continue to preach it down to the final end of Satan’s organization, never slacking the hand. Therefore all who accepted a copy of the book thereby expressed their unqualified allegiance to that Kingdom and unequivocally committed themselves to zealous, consistent and continuous activity in preaching tlie gospel of the Kingdom. By announcing the Kingdom we shall be preaching “freedom now”; for only the Kingdom can give true freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is much work to be done. “Freedom now” must be preached in all the world for a testimony. Will it be accomplished within the divinely allotted time? Jehovah will see to It that it will be. The question that concerns us individually is: Will I have a part in this great and all-important work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, of proclaiming freedom now ? That will depend upon our faith and appreciation. If we have put our faith in the Kingdom of Jehovah as the government of our choice; if we appreciate it as tlie Instrument which Jehovah will use to vindicate his name and give everlasting life and true freedom to man; if we appreciate tlie glorious treasure of service that is ours in connection</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Servant to Brethren’s Visit</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While busily engaged in the proclamation of this gospel of the Kingdom for many years, God’s visible organization lias been blessed of him in developing definite instructions for the advancement and bestpossible handling of the work in hand. Brethren known as servants to the brethren are at present being I used to aid the companies in understanding and applying these organization instructions so that all companies and other publishers may operate in unity and the most effective manner possible. The prosperity and increase of all units of God’s people is measured by tlie application through God’s spirit of i Theocratic instructions; therefore the responsibility of faithful conformity to these as brought to the company’s attention is manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Instructions Clarified for Company’s Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any suggestions or instructions on improving files, stock arrangement, accounts system, advertising activity, any feature of company organization, or field activity, come from the servant to the brethren not in criticism but with the sincere desire to remedy defects and aid all willing ones to improve their capacity for service. In carefully considering the information as given on the Company Information form, the servant to the brethren is able to convey to all the servants first and then the entire company that which is needful to offset any deficiencies and render assistance in making future progress. Hence the main worth of the servant’s visit lies not merely in the benefits obtained while he is present witli the company, but in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the company's <sup>!</sup> future conformity to the information and counsel given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This means that the servant to the brethren must be thoroughly familiar with the duties of all serv</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Responsibility in Applying Theocratic Instructions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">ants in the company, and be able during his meeting with them to advise on the proper performance of their duties. The same applies to every feature of Kingdom activity and the best manner of conducting it. Therefore, in his ministry both to the servants and the entire company, lie will bring forth much counsel and admonition that all who love the Lord will be most anxious and willing to carry out so that the best possible results will be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefits of Applied Instruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before being visited by the servant to the brethren the spiritually healthy company will naturally be putting forth the best possible effort to advance the Kingdom interests, ail servants and publishers co-operating joyfully in doing so. Upon notice of his visit, the Company Information form will be accurately and neatly filled out in duplicate by the company committee, in order to present a true picture of the company’s condition. The servant to the brethren’s discussion of this form before all the servants and study conductors will present a full description of what each one may do in order to improve whatever defects appear in the company activity; and, having this information before him, and the proposed remedy, every servant of the company will be fully equipped to operate at highest efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The entire company will turn out in whole-hearted and cheerful support of the servant to the brethren’s efforts to assist them. Thankful appreciation for Theocratic instruction received will be manifested, and faithful application thereof will follow. Thus the endeavor of every company will be to the end of ever increasing in understanding and the ability to put into effect organization instructions, and to thus grow in capacity to faithfully serve the Lord.</span></p>

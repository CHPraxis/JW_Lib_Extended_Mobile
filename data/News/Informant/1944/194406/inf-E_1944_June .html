</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>All Able Ministers Will Take Part</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Again the keynote of education rings in our ears as the guiding theme for our activity during June. Like the stream of water seen by Ezekiel coining from under the east gate of the temple and which increased until it became a mighty river, the great flow of truth from God’s temple organization swells ever greater; and happy indeed are all those who now avail themselves of every opportunity to serve as educators in pointing men of goodwill to freedom and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In bearing to the people tlie message as presented in the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind, The Coming World Regeneration, </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> we readily see the necessity for all of Jehovah's freemen to equip themselves as more able ministers, in order to advance with the great educational program. All now being taught by the Great Educator must needs be ‘apt to teach, in meekness instructing', so that all turning toward Zion may be shown how to flee from religion's bondage to God's way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Outline of June Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The June campaign unfolds then, as, first, enthusiastic presentation of the offer for the month: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind, The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 30c. Where this is not possible, present </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a 25c contribution. Where the combination cannot be placed a diligent effort will be made to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span><span class="font2"> on a 5c contribution. One of the first steps toward desiring to live in the New World is to see the abominations committed in the old religious world. The new booklet will certainly open the eyes of all ‘sighing and crying because of these abomi nations’; so every educator in freedom will put forth intense effort to acquaint all possible with the truths contained in this timely provision of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second lint' of activity open in June is the calling back on all who manifested interest while taking the three-booklet offer during May. Surely many of these will have been stimulated to learn more of God’s Word, and once more the willing educator will be eager and ready to &quot;teach” by presenting the June combination, and making arrangements to call back some more and eventually be found conducting a book study in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Studies Will Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The third feature of teaching activity by the Lord’s zealous educators in this busy time is the grandest of all, as it really affords all able ministers opportunity to see the fruit of their labor and operate as educators by advancing the education of the “other sheep&quot;. This involves the development in knowledge of the many thousands of newly interested who subscribed for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> during the three-month campaign. Over 15(1,000 people of goodwill became new subscribers during the greatest magazine campaign conducted by God's people, and now the time is ripe to perform as able ministers by patiently and in meekness instructing these good-will people. Having the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> they can be called upon with the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirhiind,</span><span class="font2"> and the question booklet. Have the people open their book at the very first paragraph, ask the question from tlie question booklet, look up the scriptures presented in answer to the question, sum up the matter by having the paragraph read, and the foundation has been laid for a book study wherever sufficient interest exists. How wonderfully the first chapter of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> fits in with the “Educators in Freedom” Testimony Period! There the Great Educator, our example, shines forth in zealous action calling upon men to learn the truth so that they may be made free. Truly an inspiration for all educators to live up to their opportunities and teach those willing to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Educator Very Busy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Properly viewed, then, June appears as a time of tremendous activity in the advancement of Jehovah's great educational work. The truth will not destroy the Devil's organization (that will be done by the power of the Almighty), but certainly the truth is the only thing that will make men free. It is the only thing that will point out the way to life. Let no able minister of God avoid sharing in the mighty campaign. Let every freeman rejoice in his blessed opportunities by wholly sharing in distributing the June offer, especially trying to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span><span class="font2"> with all persons possible. As educators, go farther than merely placing the literature: follow up interest manifested by people met in both tlie recent booklet activity and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, by making back-calls and developing book studies in every home where “men of good-will” are found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The education of men looking for freedom and life expands. Rejoice and share in it. June can be the busiest and greatest month of activity yet, if all educators in freedom will respond.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The New World</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book Leaflet</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has on hand a good supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Few World</span><span class="font2"> book leaflets. This is an attractive leaflet and carries a very fine message, in picture as well as in words. Because of tlie paper restrictions, the Society has discontinued the printing of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> leaflets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies who can use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Rew World</span><span class="font2"> book leaflets should include them in their next order to the Society. The regular rate will apply. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> leaflets are available again announcement will be made in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Bethel Closed for Convention Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Bethel home, factory and office will be closed from August 7 to August 23 inclusive. Tlie Society requests that all pioneers and companies wanting literature for use during this time please send their orders to the Society no later than July 17. If you do this, it will avoid a last-minute rush. No orders will be filled or correspondence answered from August 7 to August 23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Vacation Pioneer Ranks Open</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Will You “Redeem” Vacation Time?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout the land hundreds of younger brethren are out of school for summer vacation or will be out shortly. As one of these, you want to “redeem” summer time or make it good. The Devil, the great waster, would have you waste this time in foolish pursuits of the “old world”, but you, as one of Jehovah’s servants, will apply such to the “glorious treasure of service” given you and use it in the campaign of “free education” that is moving forward every day. By doing this you will be maintaining your integrity and upholding Jehovah’s side of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last year over 300 young brothers and sisters used the summer vacation time in the full-time service. We hope that all of these will enroll again this year. A number of them will be able to enter the regular pioneer ranks, due to having finished school this season. In addition to these, many others will be in position to enter full-time ranks for the summer. The invitation to ‘honor thy Creator in the days of thy youth’ in the vacation pioneer service is open. The question is, “Can you enroll?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Y<sup>T</sup>ou may ask, “What are the requirements?” “What must I do?” “Where can I work?” Perhaps you say, “I can’t go to some far-away assignment,” and numerous other things. Well, we answer: The re</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>April Report</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The April report is very encouraging. 62,1.3!) publishers reported; which is the greatest number of pub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ushers reporting in the United States since October, 1043. The houraverage of 15.!) for company publishers is also the highest since October, 1043. The most striking part of this report, however, is tlie remarkable increase in number of back-calls for company publishers. This average of 4.2 is the highest we have had for 3i years, or since October, 1040, much of which, undoubtedly, can be attributed to the course in Theocratic ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perhaps there are some who have not yet begun evening witnessing, nor made arrangements to step up their effectiveness for summer witnessing by allowing in their budget more time for service, or have permitted other drawbacks to interfere with their service. Can we improve this? Come on, company publishers! Let's all put forth more effort in June and see if we can reach a new peak! It can be done!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">quirements are not too hard, yet you will have to work to meet them. 150 hours a month, an average of only five hours a day, should be spent in the service, in all features of it. You will do this work in line with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions, </span><span class="font2">the orderly way the Lord lias set forth for you to work. You can work in your own locality, and it won't be necessary for you to go to some far-off assignment. You can more effectively speak the truth to those you know; for they have no doubt seen your “works” of righteousness manifested in the company publisher service. You should “let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you can put in the necessary time and meet the all-round requirements, write the Society immediately asking for a “Summer Vacation Pioneer Service” application blank, and such will be sent you, as well as complete instructions. Be sure to put your complete name and address on your letter. After your application has been accepted, then you should obtain the necessary literature for witnessing from a near-by pioneer. The supplies for reporting, etc., will be sent to you by the Society. We hope to see a peak of summer vacation pioneers enrolled and working “full swing” by July. Are you going to enroll now and begin work immediately?</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let a Man Examine Himself</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>“No More Time for the Old Course”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">is the text which the Lord holds before us for July. This text is a challenge to everyone who has entered into a covenant with Jehovah. If we have no more time for the old course, then all our time should be for the new course. This transfer of time and energy from the old course to the new course does not just happen. It requires much more than just coming to tlie conclusion that such is the proper thing to do. Effort is involved. We must definitely take tlie time and the energy that is now being used to perpetuate ‘old world’ interests (regardless of whether those old world interests are noble or ignoble according to the worldly standards) and use that time and energy in the interests of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This means humbling oneself under the mighty hand of God. It means recognizing that we are subject to the specific anil detailed requirements of the New World government established by Jehovah God. It means recognizing and acknowledging the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; of the Lord as the one whom he has made ruler over all his goods and ruler over his household and joyfully submitting to that rulership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then only can we say that we have “no more time for the old course”. Then only will the Lord's directions coming through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> and other Society publications. have their proper effect upon us. Then only will the free education of men of good-will be recognized as a definite obligation resting upon every consecrated servant of the Lord. Then only will company publishers recognize that GO hours and 12 back-calls a month and one back-call Ixiok study a week are New World Government requirements to which they are obligated to conform according to their ability. Then only will pioneers appreciate that the requirement of 150 hours a month, and other branches of the pioneer work in proportion advancing the Kingdom interests, is a requirement established by the Lord through his “faithful and wise servant” and appreciate that it is not a matter of having their name on some “preferred list”, but the meeting of the New World Government requirements, that is pleasing to the Lord and merits his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore, each one, commencing immediately, should determine to devote no more time to the ‘old course’ and seriously apply the admonition in 1 Peter 4:2,3 to themselves and live the still remaining time executing the will of our God as He directs through his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Continue with the Same Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During July the campaign will continue with the presentation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, Beligion Heaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coining World liegeneration,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 3ile, presenting them in the same manner as we did throughout the month of June. With the month of July added to this campaign, each company and pioneer publisher will have approximately nine weeks to cover his entire assignment with this offer. This will include Independence Day (July 4), when practically all of the Lord's people are free to show that they have “no more time for the old course&quot;. Your entire territory should be completely covered with this presentation. The fact that some of the people may have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> is no reason why this combination could not be presented in its completeness. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth”</span><span class="font2"> book is a personal study book. Every member of the family who hopes for life in the New World should have his personal copy, should study it diligently, should make notes on It and mark it up. These points should be impressed upon the people who have the book already, as a reason for getting additional copies for the other members of the family and for having a book study in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">House-to-house witnessing, making back-calls, conducting back-call book studies, and regular participation in the magazine work are the only practical ways we can demonstrate that we really mean it when we say that we have “no more time for the old course”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Save and Return Cartons!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The shortage of new shipping cartons has again become acute. The Society would be pleased to have the empty shipping cartons returned that companies have on hand from shipments previously received from us. These should be only cartons with the cloth tapes intact, and otherwise suitable for packing and shipping new literature. When saving cartons for the Society's use, the following suggestions should be kept in mind: Do not cut or remove the cloth tape. Break down the cartons by removing the paper tape and opening up the flaps at both ends. Important! </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Do not fold at the cloth tape.</span><span class="font2"> Sort the cartons according to size and bundle them with about 20 cartons to a bundle, tied with strong rope. Please do not ship less than 100 pounds in a shipment. Your description on the bill of lading should be as follows: “Corrugated cartons K. D. Hat. (Used)” Note: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">In all cases communicate with the Brooklyn office before shipping.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Theocratic Ministry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">June 4 is the date when all companies everywhere are to start going over the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> for the second time. Each company, large or small, should arrange to have the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> as one of its regular studies during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Theocratic ministry instructor should be ever on the alert to assist and encourage each and every one in the company to have some part in the course as suggested in the correspondence already sent you on this matter and in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font2">lie should particularly be on the lookout for those brothers who show ability, and assign them to instruction talks from time to time, as well as to the regular student talks. In such cases the brethren selected should be those who are capable of treating the assigned subjects properly. One brother might be well qualified to treat subjects like “The Use of Bible Dictionaries” or “The Use of Concordances”, etc., but might not be so well qualified to take up subjects like “Parts of Speech”, “Pronunciation,” etc. Therefore in the selection care should be taken to assign to the brethren selected subjects that they are qualified'to handle properly. We look for the remarkable evidence of the Lord’s favor and blessing upon this branch of Theocratic education manifested during the past year to increase very materially during the coming year.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren everywhere are intensely interested in the results of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign. They have really put forth a wonderful effort to make this campaign fruitful, and, as always, the Lord blessed their efforts with success. We cannot give you the complete report at this time, but to date there has been a total of 156.000 new subscriptions received and put through the office. There are a great many more in the mail. That means that there are that many more families throughout the country who are receiving regenerating water of truth into their homes regularly. This incomplete report exceeds by about 8,500 last year's total for the entire campaign.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Consolation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 631</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">contains the report of the “Free Nation's Theocratic Assembly&quot; held at Minneapolis, August 20, 21, 22, 1943. We still have about 9,000 copies of this number on band. The information contained therein is intensely interesting and instructive, particularly to the newly interested, some of whom attended and some of whom did not attend the assembly last year. These should be in the hands of the people as soon as possible. In order to clear out the number we have in stock, the Society will supply them at 21c a copy to all companies and pioneers while they last. The orders, however, should be included with orders for other material, so as to keep the shipping costs down. Companies who can use any number of this issue, please send in your orders immediately. Use those to interest the good-will people in attending the coming August assembly.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Accounts Servant</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The new instruction form on “Company Accounts&quot; has done much to clarify tlie duties of accounts servants. Certainly, now that a unified system has been provided, it merely becomes a matter of careful study and application of these instructions in order for all companies to t-.se the same method in keeping account of all money transactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The proper method of handling all four basic accounts has lieen clearly shown, and the accounts servant, by following this method, need not have much difficulty in this direction. By making neat entries with typewriter or ink on the Society’s forms, and not trying to use some “better” way of tabulation, the accounts servant will keep a clear and uniform record that can easily be checked, and will avoid mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bank Account Where Possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all companies where sufficient money is handled, a bank account in the name of the local company will be kept, and all checks drawn on that account will be signed by the accounts servant and countersigned by the company servant. Once a month a remittance will be made to the Society, using either bank draft or post office money order, thus avoiding loss by sending currency through tlie mails. These remittances for literature will be sent direct to the Society; not to depots, nor handed to servants to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The accounts servant will check all transactions with the Society from the invoices and credit memos, and have all discrepancies remedied as soon as possible. As far as the local organization is concerned, tlie accounts servant will pay no bill unless approved by the company servant. In order that the Society’s instructions on remittances may be observed, the accounts servant will provide an itemized list of money being sent to the Society, so that the company servant can indicate clearly on the remittance form the various accounts to be credited. Wherever possible, the same individual will not be used as company servant and accounts servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The accounts servant will see that contribution boxes are placed at all meeting places, including appointed book-study meetings, so that those attending may be privileged to contribute toward the advancement of local Kingdom interests. He will also receive, at least once a week, all money received by the stock and advertising servants, giving them a credit memo as a receipt. Where money is received at appointed book studies for literature taken by publishers attending these meetings, it also will be handed to the accounts servant in like manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Monthly Financial Statement</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the first service meeting of each month, the accounts servant will read a statement of the company's financial standing, as outlined in the &quot;Company Accounts” form. Where the accounts servant is a sister tlie information may be given to the company servant for presentation. A true picture of the company's entire financial position may be obtained by receiving a statement of tlie value of company stock from the stock servant, and the value of magazines on hand from the advertising servant. To completely prevent discrepancies from creeping into the company’s accounts, the company servant or someone designated by him will audit these every three months.</span></p>

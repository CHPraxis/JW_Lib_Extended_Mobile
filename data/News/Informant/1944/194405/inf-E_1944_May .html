<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Clean Up</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The scope of the great command of the Lord forming our 1944 service calendar text for May is not limited to any particular section of the earth, but takes in the entire globe. His command to his disciples was, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, . . . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19,20) This command applies now to the “faithful and wise servant”, the Lord's Society of his present disciples, and which Society is devoted to carrying out this command. It also applies to their companions and all people of good-will who now have a knowledge of the Lord’s purposes. The Lord's favor and blessing is evident on his organized people in that great headway is being made toward the end of expanding the campaign of free education to all nations. This is clearly shown by the Lord’s blessing on the course in Theocratic ministry and on the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the greatest number of persons throughout all nations may be fed from the Lord’s great storehouse and taught his precepts and law, the Society has used and continues to use every legitimate means of getting the teaching work done. One means of taking the message of free education to the people is that of booklets containing the Kingdom message in concise and compact form. Throughout the country there are thousands of colored-cover booklets that have been printed since about 1930 and shipped to the Lord's people for distribution but, for one reason or another, have not been placed in the hands of the people. All of these abound in the truth that the prospective “other sheep” of the Lord must receive. These publications the Lord caused to be printed for a purpose. They should not stay in storage as they have been with many companies and pioneers for some time. No, these are to be put to their intended and proper use now. The work for May is arranged for that purpose. The Lord is no waster, and he is directing that these be not wasted by deterioration simply because there is such an abundant supply of later publications on hand. Each booklet contains its own specific Theocratic message essential to a full knowledge of the Lord's purposes. Therefore it is imperative that these be placed in the hands of the people now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Combination Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer will be three booklets on a 10c contribution. These booklet combinations will, by most companies and pioneers, be made up of two surplus colored-cover booklets and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Tiegeneration.</span><span class="font2"> The latter should be included in every combination. If you run low on colored-cover booklets, make it one coloredcover booklet and two self-covered. If you run completely out of coloredcover booklets it will be in order to offer three self-covered ones on the ten-cent contribution. If they do not wish the combination, stress the importance of their reading </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> stating that they may contribute a small amount for it. If they do not wish to contribute, but will promise to read it, leave it with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Assist New Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May will afford a splendid opportunity for the servants, regular publishers and book study conductors to assist the new publishers, particularly those reporting activity in April for the Memorial special service week-end, and also the ones attending Memorial that expressed definite interest and wish to have part in Theocratic service. No doubt you have territory that needs covering with the new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">prior to the regular current offer. Give these new publishers the opportunity of covering a section of the territory with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, News, </span><span class="font2">and point out how they have the privilege of calling back on the people in such territory a week later with the current booklet offer. Show them how to present the literature, and then suggest that they try witnessing alone in the territory. Provide them with the necessary forms for reporting: “Publisher’s Field Service Report” slips, “Back-Call” slips, “Back-Call Follow-Up” slips, “House to House Record” forms, and instruct them as to the proper use of such. Also, the blank testimony cards can be furnished the very new ones, such cards being obtainable on request at the Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn. Suggest the use of the phonograph and the doorstep setup if the phonograph is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant should see that group-witnessing arrangements are made to cover territory not assigned individually and isolated urban (thickly populated) sections. The servants, study conductors and regular publishers should take the initiative and see that definite arrangements are made so that all associated and new interest desiring a part in the work will have the opportunity to participate. By special concentration, making personal affairs conform to increasing Theocratic requirements, along with the assistance that the new publishers will give in covering the territory, each territory in the company should be covered approximately one time during May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Clean Up “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another feature of the work for May will be that of revisiting all of</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Essential to Able Ministry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The remarkable evidences of the Lord’s favor and blessing upon those who have earnestly embraced the provisions of the Theocratic ministry course during the past year are innumerable. Young and old alike have been blessed. The fluent and the halting have found it indispensable. Those whose native tongue is English and those who have been accustomed to speaking some other language alike find that they cannot get along without it. This is the Lord's provision to make one and all more able ministers, and no one can afford to do despite to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Speakers have been equipped to prepare and deliver more forceful talks. School children not only have become better Theocratic publishers, but have been enabled to excel in their school work as a result of the practical knowledge acquired and the intelligent and orderly manner of presentation. Our brethren speaking other than English have probably been blessed most of all, because this course proved an invaluable aid in acquiring knowledge of English and in arranging and presenting it in the most effective manner possible. The sisters, while not permitted to have part in the speaking assignments, because of Scriptural limitations, have, nevertheless, been greatly blessed by a diligent study of the instruction material, looking up additional scriptures and using reference works, etc., which has increased their knowledge and broadened their those who during February, March or April stated that they were desirous of obtaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">but for one reason or another could not take it at the time. Call back on all of such, and if they still wish to subscribe, give them the special offer. However, this is not an extension of the campaign, but is merely a provision that is to be used for cleaning up the ‘stragglers’ on your individual list of interest who indicated that they wished the magazine at the campaign rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s mercy and loving-kindness extend to all peoples of every nation, kindred and tongue. As indicated on the May poster, each consecrated servant should observe the rule that ‘in every nation whoever fears Jehovah God, and works righteousness, is accepted with him’. (Acts 10: 34, 35) Thus, as the great campaign of free education extends to all the nations, his people rejoice in having a part in this work. There is no such thing as racial prejudice in the Lord’s organization. “God is no respecter of persons.” This mes-' sage is extended to all alike in every ! territory. Therefore, during May, publishers in all companies throughout the country will press forward as one man to do the work as outlined, that all people of good-will may be taught His will to the accomplishment of His purposes. vision on all of these subjects and enabled them to intelligently contribute their part to the edification of their brethren in the discussion at the review. All have been helped in their door-to-door witnessing, in their back-calls, and in their studies with the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Theocratic ministry study is an integral part of the Theocratic requirements for the Lord’s people. Every company, regardless of size, should by now be conducting the course. Everyone in the company should attend these meetings, and all male brethren, young or old, educated or of only limited education, should enroll. Even the illiterate have been great!y assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the March statement the Society sent each company two letters and two schedules outlining in detail the course in Theocratic ministry for the coming year. This schedule commences June 4, 1944, giving three subjects for each week. Where only one speaker is scheduled for each week, the first subject should always he used. Whore two speakers are available, the first and either the second or the third subject may be used. If three speakers are scheduled, each one of the speaking assignments will be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Schedules</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the schedules is to be posted on the company information board of each company headquarters, and the other retained by the Theocratic ministry instructor in his book. Of the two letters, one should be retained by the company servant for his files and the other is to be given to the Theocratic ministry conductor for his book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many companies will have completed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> booklet before June 4. These will be ready to start on schedule. Others may have only one or two lessons left. In that event, and if the brethren can arrange to do so, the company may double up and put on two Theocratic ministry lessons a week to finish on schedule. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">All </span><span class="font2">companies are to start at the beginning of the booklet in the week of June 4 as scheduled, whether they have by that time completed the booklet or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Parts of the service meetings of the two weeks preceding the inauguration of the new schedule should be devoted to the following studies: The first week, study \ cry carefully pages 3, 4, and 5 of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font2"> booklet, up to the subhead “The Course”. Every sentence in these three pages is very important and deserving of very serious thought. In addition, each, one should privately study the material from the bottom of page 5 to page 9 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second week should be devoted to a very careful study of the letter covering the coming year's series of studies and 1h&lt;- arranging for the enrollment of new students.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Educators in Freedom” Testimony Period</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Another New Booklet</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah is always far ahead of the enemy. Right at this time, when Sata n’s visible organization is straining every possible resource to train and educate thousands, yes, millions, of men and women for jobs to advance the ‘affairs of this old world’ and to patrol the earth in future years, Jehovah has established the government of his new world and provides the “Educators tn Freedom” Testimony Period, designating the month of June, for the enlightenment of people of goodwill who wish to live in that new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The greatest educational work ever inaugurated on the earth is now being sponsored by the Lord. All other educational and intellectual enterprises are destined to certain, complete and everlasting destruction at Armageddon. The efforts of educating the people of good-will in freedom will not be defeated by the enemy, but will continue on and bear fruit throughout eternity. You who are privileged to be educators in freedom are not laboring in vain, as are the so-called “educators” and “teachers” of the old world, whose efforts will soon pass away and be for ever forgotten. Those who love the Lord delight to do his will as educators in freedom and will say, “I will walk at liberty : for I seek thy precepts. I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.&quot; (Psalm 119:45,40) Thus, the freedom-lover will walk at liberty through the cities, towns, villages, streets, from door to door, and every other place where he can “speak of thy testimonies” unashamed before the people of the land, as well as before the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Religion Reaps the Whirlwind” </span><span class="font2">is the title of a new attractively designed colored-cover 64-page booklet that will be released for distribution far and wide during June. This is the first colored-cover booklet published for over three years. The booklet is perhaps the most striking that has yet been printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is little doubt that the message contained in this booklet will be joyously received by thousands of good-will persons. This has already been demonstrated by the enthusiastic reception given to its message at a number of assemblies addressed by the president of the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brother N. H. Knorr, on his recent extended tour. Now that the Lord has provided us with such a marvelous weapon and comforting message for all of good-will, the proper thing is to make definite plans for utilizing it in the most efficient and effective manner possible to advance the Kingdom interests. Therefore, every company and pioneer should plan to get the entire consignment out into the hands of the people before the end of June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The days are longer now and it will be possible to spend two or three hours in the evening distributing this booklet. The company servant, assistant company servant and stock servant should arrange for special service campaigns with the booklet Stress this feature at the service meetings during this month. Emphasize the need that every publisher and good-will person have part in this all-important work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All book-study conductors should have a supply on hand for new publishers and to supply the newly interested to distribute among their friends and relatives. This will afford a splendid opportunity for them</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">to get started In the house-to-house work with the booklet. Be sure to contact every party on your back-call list with this special booklet, and give particular attention to those people who subscribed for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> during the recent campaign. Call back on these people and discuss its wonderful message with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer for the “Educators in Freedom” Testimony Period (June) will be the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> the self-covered booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> all on a contribution of 30c. If they do not take this offer, then you may drop down to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and the self-covered booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> on a 25c contribution. From there you may drop to the new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> on a 5c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consignments of this new booklet are now being sent out and all should have their supply in time to begin the June campaign. Consignments for pioneers who are associated with a company will be shipped together with the company consignment. Every pioneer is being sent 130 of these booklets. Each company’s past records have been considered, and they will be sent as many booklets as it is believed they can dispose of during this campaign, on the average of about 20 to 25 booklets per publisher. These should be divided up among the publishers so that each may have a portion to I distribute in his territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">June will be a very busy month for all “educators in freedom”. Let I us all put our shoulder to the wheel; and push harder than ever before during June, caring for our goodwill interest, and unmasking religion and proclaiming Jehovah’s coming whirlwind by distributing our latest provision, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Letter of Appreciation to Pioneers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">With the crumbling and passing away of the present old world affairs, the service of the incoming New World of righteousness takes on ever-increasing importance and delight to those who love Jehovah. In review of six months of the pioneer activity, the Society has sent a letter of appreciation to those fulltime servants who have given themselves freely to the service of God, rejoicing with them in the many evidences of Jehovah’s favor upon their activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hours, back-calls, and book studies have all been increased by the pioneers, in keeping with the advancement of the mighty campaign of free education now being carried forward under the supervision of our great King, and it is apparent that many more brethren are desirous of sharing in these blessings by devoting themselves to full-time service. These realize that this is not an easy way out of present world difficulties; in fact, times may be harder while engaging in pioneer action; but where else can the joy, peace, and evidence of God’s favor that comes from full-time service be equaled? May Jehovah bless and guide all who contemplate devoting their entire time to His service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Report on “Watchtower”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Campaign</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>AU Previous Records Shattered!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Since the inception of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">Campaigns, several years ago, many thousands of subscriptions have been obtained and thousands of people of good-will have come into semimonthly contact with the Lord’s visible organization through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> and thousands have also seen their privilege of direct and constant association with the organization. The 1944 campaign extends to thousands more this much-needed and vital contact</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In spite of the magnitude of past campaigns, none have approached the immensity that this 1944 campaign promises. Already, with only the February and March subscriptions entered, a total of approximately 100,000 subscriptions (English and foreign) have been put through. The two-month report in round figures reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">20</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Total subscriptions 100,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though this is the highest twomonth figure yet, this does not mean that the quota set for the campaign has been reached. No, that quota is for 100,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions alone. All expectations are, however, that the quota will be more than reached when the complete campaign returns are received at headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers have co-operated well in following Instructions on sending in subscriptions, which has greatly facilitated the necessary office work of handling these thousands of new subscriptions. However, a number of the brethren working in cities that have the new postal zone arrangement either fail to list the zone number or put down the wrong number on the subscription slip. Please watch this.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>March Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">March has seen the largest number of publishers in the field service in this country since October, 1943, with 61,502 reporting. This report shows an excellent Improvement over the previous winter months in hours spent in the service and publishers reporting. The pioneers are doing very well and have reached a new peak in back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now that summer is near, with its good weather, longer days, and with two new booklets, vacation coming, and a few holidays to give us more time for the Lord’s service, all should make definite plans for improving their activity during the coming month. Assist newly interested ones to get into the service, so that a new peak in publishers may be reached.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Back-Call Servant</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The continuous expansion of the educational activity of God’s able ministers causes the duties of the back-call servant to occupy a position of much responsibility in the company organization. The gathering together or assembling of the “other sheep” with those of Zion depends to a large extent upon the faithfulness of each company in carrying forward the back-call service to acquaint those of good-will with the way to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For these reasons the back-call servant must have a clear vision of the timeliness of diligent back-call activity, take the lead in this feature of service, and keep it continually before the company for its advancement. He will check the publishers’ record cards with the intent of aiding all not doing back-call work to see Its urgent necessity and have a share in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All Essential Forms Provided</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many forms have been provided and a complete system developed by the Society for keeping the record of all interest located in the different territories. The back-call servant must see to it that these forms are utilized by all in the company. Always alert to discern good-will interest, the publisher will record the names of all definitely interested. After making the first back-call, a follow-up slip is promptly made out and given to the back-call servant. After it has been established by three back-calls that genuine interest exists, the back-call servant will then make out a permanent record slip and keep it in his permanent file. In order to see that all names are being properly cared for he will then check all the follow-up slips received each month with the permanent back-call slips on hand. If some names are not being followed up, he should ascertain the reason. If the person is still interested, the back-call servant will make all effort possible to see that the good-will person is regularly called on. The permanant slip should be destroyed only if interest no longer exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Proper System of Filing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advancement of the back-call activity will result from continual checking by the back-call servant with all study conductors and publishers in the company, and keeping all back-call information neatly and accurately filed. The first essential, then, is to get all publishers back-call-minded and engaging freely in this work, and to exercise much care in keeping the records thereof. A working back-call file will be kept with all the names located in unassigned territory, which names will be handed to publishers whenever the territory is taken out. In this connection there must be close co-operation between the back-call and territory servants. Permanent back-call slips will be filed according to territory, arranging such in alphabetical order within each territory. This will be the permanent or duplicate file for the company's records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The whole company can be thoroughly instructed in back-call activity by frequent appearance of the back-call servant on the service meeting programs. Demonstrations can be made to illustrate the development of good-will interest from its first location until definitely associated with the organization. To assure that new interest is being properly tied In with the local organization the back-call servant should co-operate closely with all study </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">groups.</span></p>

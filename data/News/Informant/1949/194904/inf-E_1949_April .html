<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Our Goal: 87,000 Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Darker and darker becomes the outlook for the citizens of this old world as they see one effort after another on the part of the only hope they know of, the United Nations, end in failure. But what else can they expect? for “many failures added together do not sum up success”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How foolish to put one’s hope in that which is certain to fail! Only an exceedingly small number are wise. They place their trust, not in the doomed creation of dying men, but in the “Nations’ Hope” provided by the Almighty God himself. That hope is Christ the King, of whom Romans 15:12 (A.S.U., margin) declares: “On him shall the nations hope.” That hope will never disappoint those who put their trust in him, but will bring them peace, prosperity and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Goal of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But how can men ‘set their hope on him of whom they have not heard’? The obligation rests upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">everyone</span><span class="font3"> already Informed regarding that hope to make him known to others. If that were done it would mean that the 87,000 publishers who have had some part In the field service during the past year would all be active during the month of April. This in itself would realize our goal. And that quota would be far surpassed as hundreds, yes, thousands of informed “Bible students” join the ranks of the “Nations’ Hope” proclaimers. Clearly we can reach a new peak in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why such an emphasis on new peaks? some may ask. Not for pecuniary gain, neither to boast in numbers. No, but because the Scriptures foretold that Zion would have to lengthen her ropes and strengthen her stakes; that one would become a thousand, and a little one a strong nation. God, having promised, will do his part in fulfilling those promises, and we delight to see progress toward their complete fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Climaxing</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the &quot;Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> fitting offer to present during the “Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">“Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom,” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> high-lighting the significant signs of the times, a bound book filled with hope-building Bible instruction, and the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind,</span><span class="font3"> all on a contribution of two dollars! Where they do not respond to that remarkable offer, or the reduced offer of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription or of the bound book, make a special effort to leave at least a copy of the new booklet. Another way to spread the good news contained in this new booklet is to furnish those with whom we have home Bible studies with a supply to place with friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To make April an outstanding month we must get started at the very beginning. This is the last month of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign ; so let us put forth every effort to make it the best. Have you met your quota? Then see by how much you can exceed it Are you still short? Then, beseeching Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts, strive diligently to attain it. Accompanying successful publishers into the field will afford practical assistance in obtaining subscriptions. Be subscription-conscious in your back-call and street activity. Doing your best you can confidently expect to attain your quota by the end of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Back-Calls and Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only should April see an alltime peak in publishers, but by putting forth diligent efforts we should also be able to reach all-time peaks in back-calls and home Bible studies. So, make back-calls on subscribers, on obtalners of bound books, wherever interest has been found, as well as on those whose expiration slips have been sent to you. Assist these to become informed regarding the nations’ hope so that they in turn can aid others to put their trust in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the start of the new series of public talks, April should also see increased public meeting activity. It is suggested that each company set as its goal at least one public meeting every week during April. If your company is too small to do this by itself, perhaps speakers can be obtained from some near-by company. In all events, endeavor to arrange for a public meeting for Sunday April 17. Yes, also publicly proclaim the nations’ hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By getting off to a good start in all these various avenues of service Memorial week should see the greatest field service activity to date; also the largest attendance at Memorial. Last year the attendance was 117,113. What will it be this year? In both January and February this year we had over 12,000 more publishers than in the corresponding months last year. By how many more than 12,000 can we exceed last year’s Memorial attendance? That will largely depend upon how thoroughly we advertise it, at our public meetings, in our house-to-house activity and in our back-call work. (For further details regarding Memorial week activity see March </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a night of ever-increasing darkness settles over the world, let us with ‘yet more and more’ diligence point lovers of righteousness to the nations’ hope. Let each one of us make April a month full of zealous, joyful activity to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I . . . will yet praise thee </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more”</span><span class="font3"> will be the joyful acclamation of all youthful ministers of God who enroll as vacation pioneers in 1949. The call for vacation pioneers again goes forth, and it is believed that 1949 can be the biggest year yet in this feature of service as we endeavor to exceed our 1948 peak of 797 vacation pioneers. The requirement of 100 hours a month, an average of less than 3J hours a day, can surely be attained with ease by consecrated Christians who have the summer months free for full-time Kingdom service. For many, vacation pioneering will be a new, refreshing experience; for those who have served in previous years </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it will be a</span><span class="font3"> joyous renewing of the grand privilege of daily praise to God. There could be no more profitable way of using your vacation period than in the service to which your life is primarily devoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Summer pioneers are encouraged to set for themselves a quota of at least two months’ vacation pioneer service. Perhaps you can arrange to</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Memorial Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">A Memorial report card is being sent to each company with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> This card should be filled out and returned to the Society immediately after the public meeting following the Memorial. Each company will please fill in and return this card even though it may not have had a public meeting. Isolated pioneers who are unable to meet with a near-by company should hold their own Memorial service and then report on a postal card the following: Total attendance at Memorial ; Total partakers of emblems; Total attendance at public meeting on Sunday following Memorial. work with some fellow vacation pioneer or a general pioneer, and, as partners, encourage and help each other in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By diligently and zealously applying yourself to ‘remembering your Creator in the days of your youth’ in vacation pioneer service, you will experience many blessings. Moreover, you will grow in spiritual maturity and understanding, realize more fully the responsibility that is yours as God’s minister and become equipped for a further expanding of your ministry in the future. As God’s minister you will be anxious to deport yourself properly at all times, take your service seriously and “stick to your work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carefully consider this important matter. Discuss It with your parents and those who are pioneers. If you feel you can meet the requirements during the&quot; summer months, write for your application. The Society will count it a blessed privilege to enroll </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3"> as a vacation pioneer in 1949.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Field Service at Assemblies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Henceforth it will not be necessary for publishers to report their field service time at circuit and district assemblies. A complete report of activity at these assemblies should be kept by each publisher and turned in when you return to your home company. Field service will, of course, continue to be an important feature at all assemblies, for thereby many persons of goodwill learn of the way to life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Study Record File</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In establishing the Study Record file, the Bible study servant should make out a Study Record for each person with whom a Bible study is being conducted. The necessary data for these studies can be transferred to Study Record slips from the Permanent Back-Call Record slips. Then the old back-call forms can be discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Slips in the file for persons with whom no study is being conducted will not be placed in the Study Record file. An effort may be put forth to call upon these, particularly the more recent ones, by publishers holding the territory, in group witnessing, etc. Where there is sufficient interest to make regular back-calls, the publisher should retain the name and follow up. If a study is started, the publisher will then turn in a Study Report and from this a Study Record will be made out. Where there is no interest, the slip should be discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If there are many old slips in the file, it can be decided locally whether to spend much time trying to locate all of these people or whether to discard the slips and use the time to diligently follow up current new interest with an earnest effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Publishers to Take Increased Interest in Local Expansion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's kingdom under Christ Jesus is ever expanding. Established in heaven immovably, it is destined to shortly extend its rule to the ends of the earth. The prophetic words ring true, “Of the increase ... there shall be no end.” Jehovah’s servants are keenly interested in this expansion ; and rightly so, since they are directly connected with the expansion of true worship in this famished earth. Since first the glorious light from God’s Word began to penetrate our hearts, the desire has been to praise Jehovah “more and more” by increasing our privileges of serving him. The admonition of the apostle Paul becomes expedient, “Attend to these duties, let them absorb you, so that all men may note your progress.”—1 Tim. 4:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Expansion by Regular Praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In May, therefore, we will continue to expand our ministry of praise by now turning to the placement of three bound books with the 32-page booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind,</span><span class="font3"> on the contribution of $1.00. A review of the high points of each book used, both individually and in service meetings, will be helpful in placing the offer with the public. Not only will we place these publications with all who show interest in Jehovah’s kingdom, but we will be prompt in calling back, that we may quicken their Interest and begin home Bible studies. Here in the quiet of their home, as the Bible and textbooks thereon are diligently studied, education for life begins. It is here also- that the potential exists for expanding Jehovah’s</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Literature Credit Request Form</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The Literature Credit Request form has been revised. Order the new form with your next company order. After your supply is received the old form should no longer be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “original” and “duplicate” are now attached by a perforation so that they can be folded with a carbon paper between them for filling out. When literature is obtained by pioneers, the totals will be entered at the end of the month on both the original and duplicate as in the past and the names of the pioneers will be listed on the back of the original. The original will be separated at the perforation and sent to the Society, and the duplicate will be retained by the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society will not issue a credit memo to cover the adjustment requested with the new form. The credit will be acknowledged on the monthly statement the same as your remittances are acknowledged. This credit will be identified on the statement by the date and the symbol “PC” as well as by the number which you fill in at the upper righthand corner of the form. Start numbering with 1 and continue to number consecutively each time another one is sent in, for the entire year. Then start with 1 again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When you receive your statement, the amount credited should be checked against the duplicate. This amount will then be entered and circled in the debit column of the literature account. praise in the earth. Understanding brings with it the comprehension of one’s obligation before the Lord, and as this is perceived by those of goodwill it will be the privilege of mature ministers to aid them in taking this forward step into the service of praise. Those newly interested ones who began to publish in April should be encouraged and aided to continue in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expansion into rural areas may be undertaken during this season, affording right-hearted persons in all sections of your territory an opportunity to obtain the book offer and receive education in truth. Consider the suggestions in paragraph 18 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font3"> Plans for the public meetings to reach into the rurals should also be underway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Each Publisher to Take Personal Interest in Local Expansion </span><span class="font3">The expansion of godly praise in our communities makes the heart glad. We know that this is made possible by effective planning on the part of each publisher in co-operation with company arrangements. Attending meetings to receive instruction and spiritual food equips the minister to give a better testimony for the Kingdom. Participation in various features of the work adds variety to Kingdom service and means that our local ministry is being expanded on every front, to Jehovah’s praise. Taking advantage during May of opportunities to expand into the pioneer field will enrich the dally life of many ministers, and contribute toward local expansion, as the company nears Its goal of 10 percent. The key to increased expansion of praise is to become completely absorbed in Kingdom activity while working unitedly with fellow ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May, then, presents the opportunity for all interested in Kingdom expansion to engage in field service. Let your light so shine that men may “note your progress” in true worship and may join with you in singing Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Prepare for Public Meetings Now</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Now, before summer is upon us, is the best time to prepare for outdoor public meetings. By planning what parks you would like to use and when, application can be made in ample time to obtain the desired dates. Many park officials may not know yet of our legal right to use the parks. To wait until midsummer before making the necessary arrangements may mean that your company will not have opportunity to use this excellent means of spreading the Kingdom message, due to delay in reaching an understanding with these officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Applications should be properly made and should include request for the use of stands, chairs, etc., where these are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where parks are not available, as in some city neighborhoods or rural areas, careful plans should be made to carry on the public witness using school auditoriums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren who desire aid in properly applying for the use of parks or schools may obtain a letter of instruction and pertinent legal decisions by writing a request to the Society’s legal department.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Plan Now to Attend</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Enthusiasm throughout the land ran high when the Society’s president announced that there would be two assemblies in each district in the United States in 1949. With pleasant memories of the 1948 assemblies still fresh in mind, each of us resolved, Jehovah willing, to be present at one of the spiritual feasts promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two assemblies are being arranged for each district. The cities and dates for those definitely established are listed below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 1 Springfield, Mass., July 1-4, Coliseum, Eastern States Exposition Grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Baltimore, Md., August 26-28,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fifth Regiment Armory (Replacing the assembly previously purposed for Pittsburgh, Pa.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Birmingham, Ala., June 10-12, Alabama State Fairgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Raleigh, N.C., June 24-26,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Raleigh Memorial Auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Detroit, Mich., July 1-4,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Coliseum, Michigan State Fairgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indianapolis, Ind., July 8-10, Manufacturers Building, Indiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">State Fairgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Forth Worth, Texas, May 27-30, La Grave Field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Little Rock, Ark., June 3-5,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Robinson Memorial Auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sioux Falls, S. Dak., July 22-24, Coliseum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Another assembly is being arranged for this district for July 15-17.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sacramento, Calif., June 10-12, State Fairgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Portland, Oreg., July 1-4, Public Auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District No. 7 (Colored) Jacksonville, Fla., May 27-30, Wilder Community Center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">New Orleans, La., June 3-5, San Jacinto Club.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About two months in advance of the assembly in your portion of the district the Society will notify the companies of the rooming committee’s address and furnish other instructions. You are encouraged to attend this assembly, but if this is</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Selective Service Regulations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Those subject to the Selective Service Act of 1948 who want a copy of the Selective Service Regulations (instructions for draft boards) for their own personal use may obtain them by ordering the set from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. The subscription rate is $3 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A company or unit that desires to order the regulations for reference use by all the brethren may do so and keep them on file in the Theocratic ministry library.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Order Study Forms Sparingly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In ordering the new Study Record and Study Report forms, companies are asked to base the number ordered on actual needs, keeping in mind that for each study conducted only two Study Record forms will be required, one for file and one for the publisher; and the Study Report will be used only once each month for each study. The Society is cutting orders for these forms when the orders appear too large. not possible you may go to the one that is most convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At five of the assemblies Monday will be a holiday; so a four-day program has been arranged. The other assemblies are for three days. In all cases the scheduled days will be packed with instruction and activity. Everyone should endeavor to be present for the opening meeting of the first day, Friday at 9:30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Servants can do much to assist the brethren and persons of good-will to attend by helping to arrange car groups, special transportation where the number attending warrants it, and by keeping the assemblies before the brethren in service meetings. They should also carefully instruct the brethren to properly fill out Room Request Forms and assist in sending them in promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Assistance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All pioneers should attend a district assembly if at all possible. To assist those who are on the list as of April 1, 1949, the Society will furnish a meal ticket which will be good at any one convention city. The Society is glad to be able to thus assist pioneers to attend a district assembly, but replacement tickets cannot be issued for any that might be lost. If your ticket does not come with your May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Inform ant</span><span class="font3"> and you were a pioneer on or before April 1, notify the Society </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">immediately.</span><span class="font3"> Pioneers should not go to the assembly city ahead of time unless they are called for pre-convention work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly Counsel</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the dates for the first of the district assemblies are now quite close, a few points of counsel are appropriate. One of these concerns rooming accommodations. If you want the rooming committee to obtain rooms for you, send in your request ; and if you make a request, accept the rooms and stay where you are assigned. An opportunity is afforded to do much good at these homes by proper conduct and by witnessing to these kind people. But to fail to go to assigned accommodations can and does do much harm. Much trouble and expense is often undergone to ready rooms for us. Failure to come, or to notify them in case of emergency, understandably arouses their ill will. This should not happen, although, we regret to say, it has happened in the past. Remember: If you write for rooms, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCEPT AND OCCUPY THEM. If yOU </span><span class="font3">wish to obtain your own accommodations at the convention city, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">do not send in a Room Request Form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another point concerns travel. When going to and from the assembly use care and courtesy. Reckless driving or thoughtless pushing in train or bus stations should not be associated with Christians assembling to worship God. Be thoughtful and patient at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the assembly itself show respect to others as well as the speaker by paying close heed to everything said and refraining from conversing or walking about during sessions. As many as can will want to volunteer for service so that this essential burden will not be carried by only a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The district assemblies will play a large part in praising Jehovah more and more in 1949. Let each of us, then, make the most of the district assembly arrangement. Come prepared to attend each session, bring literature and other equipment for witnessing, and if at all possible bring someone of good-will with you.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>All</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Witnesses Urged to Show Belief Publicly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">“Are you saved?” Properly Jehovah’s witnesses answer, “Thus far, yes.” Finding themselves in a saved condition through belief in God and Christ, however, does not guarantee final salvation in the New World. There must be a steady </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">showing of </span><span class="font3">belief, a proving of faith, for final salvation. Showing belief means service, active, zealous service that brings Into play all the available faculties—the mind to study and absorb God’s truths, the feet to carry one out into the streets and up to the doors, the mouth and tongue to make public confession, the hands to hold truth-bearing publications and the “sword of the spirit”. Showing belief means living up In all ways to the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”, graciously bestowed upon us by the “Saviour of all men”. —1 Timothy 4:10, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Life-saving Work with &quot;The Watchtower'’ and &quot;Awakel” </span><span class="font3">To the ends of the earth Jehovah's witnesses will make a public show of their belief during the next four months, concentrating their energies and faculties upon the presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">Wonderfully blessed are we in receiving these Theocratic Bible magazines weekly. ‘Whatsoever things are honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report’ fill our minds. But the blessings of peace and hope of life are not for us alone. An unnumbered multitude of “all nations” must yet cry out: “Salvation to our God . . . and unto the Lamb.” For salvation of our “neighbors”, then, as well as ourselves, Jehovah’s witnesses will show belief by placing with the people the only Theocratic, hopebuilding magazines on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To perform their life-saving work with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses must go from house to house, in obedience to the divine commission. In no other way can we reach the full number of “other sheep” who sigh and cry and sorely need the truths of salvation obtainable through weekly Biblemagazine service. We urge, therefore, that at the very outset of our 1949 life-saving ministry every witness of Jehovah who can do so plan his dally affairs to permit a regular share In house-to-house preaching with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">Individual effort In the door-to-door field of praise will be blessed of the Lord, and, with more ministers serving today than ever before, the 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign can and should witness a greater number of subscriptions than any previous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But what of the aged and infirm, unable to go from house to house? Are they exempt from the need of showing belief? Indeed not. Nor do they want it so. Their hearts swell with desire to proclaim glad tidings, and they can do so, speaking truth and offering </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> to all who call at their homes. The telephone may be used, letters written, and other means employed to preaeh salvation to men of good-will. Aged and youthful, men and women, whatever their station In life, language or natural ability, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> of Jehovah's witnesses will delight to make a public show of belief in their life-saving work with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Quotas</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each company should establish as its quota of subscriptions for the campaign twice its peak number of publishers. Hence, if your company has a peak of 10 publishers, it should strive to obtain at least 20 new subscriptions during the four-month campaign. What a tremendous spreading of the truth will result If all are able to do this! Our quota for the United States will be 165,000 subscriptions; for the world, one half million I Pioneers will have a quota of one subscription a week, or sixteen for the campaign. Shoulder your share of the quota now and try to personally obtain at least two subscriptions during the campaign, or one a week if you are a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting the Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To awaken Interest and make the listener aware of the blessings which await him through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> the bearer of God’s message will strive for kindness, sincerity, patience, and clear, appealing speech in his presentation. Usage of the two-magazine offer will naturally require more careful preparation for the initial witness at the door, for the minister must be familiar with the changing contents of current magazines. In various sections obstacles to overcome and objections to refute differ. Each company, on the basis of local conditions, can illustrate in service meetings the most effective method of presentation through demonstrations, experiences and talks. In this campaign, stress is to be given to the two-magazine offer, with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> or another book and a booklet free, for $2.00. Where the complete offer is not desired, place emphasis on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for one year, with a booklet, for $1.00. The householder unable to accept a subscription may be glad to receive </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and a booklet, on contribution of 35e. No special testimony card is being provided. Those who wish may use the permanent testimony card, suitable for any offer, as an introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Door-to-door ministry will be accompanied by the customary street, public-meeting, back-call and book-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Pioneer Hour Checkup</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is keenly interested in helping the pioneers to meet full-time responsibilities and thus continue to share the blessings of pioneering. Hence a checkup letter was sent at the end of the first six months of the new quota arrangement to remind those who had fallen short. The response to these letters was very gratifying. The expressions of appreciation and determination from the pioneers reflect their thankfulness for the blessings they are receiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the future, the checkup will coincide with the service year. Hence the 1400-hour quota will now be counted from September 1, 1948. Those who come short during the six months ending with February, 1949, will be advised by the Society, so that they can improve their activity during the remainder of the service year, If possible, and thus meet the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Suspensions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society would like to remind the pioneers that the suspension arrangement is no longer in operation. Those who want to take some time off for one reason or another may do so without asking for a suspension. If the taking of such time off from full-time service results in the pioneer’s making less than 120 hours for that month, the pioneer should briefly give the reason in the space for kemabks at the bottom of the monthly report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This report card should be sent at the end of each mouth’s service no matter how few hours may have been put in and even if none at all; and in each instance that the hours are less than 120 for the month a brief explanation should be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers who take time off or who for any reason fall below 120 hours will, of course, endeavor to make up the time lost and strive to meet their quota for each six-month period and the entire service year.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Handle Subscriptions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">A new instruction sheet, “How to Properly Handle Subscriptions,” is being mailed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font3">It replaces the former one, which may be discarded. Consider its contents carefully in service meetings, post on bulletin board during campaigns, and preserve it in the company file for future use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">study services. In all of these an endeavor will be made to encourage interested ones to subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The millions who pray in sincerity &quot;Thy kingdom come” need to know that the Kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font3"> come. They need the life-giving message of the Kingdom contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> By God’s grace, Jehovah’s witnesses will satisfy that need, and guarantee their own salvation, by a public show of belief. Showing belief by service is the primary requirement for success of this eleventh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Company and Pioneer Orders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">From time to time weak points relative to ordering by both companies and pioneers come to our attention, points that, if remedied, will result in more efficient service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is advisable to always have company orders sent to the same address, unless there is some good reason for doing it otherwise. If circumstances make it necessary to ship orders to the stock servant, or some address other than that at which the company regularly gets its mail, the name and address used should not vary each time, nor should orders be sent to various members of the same family. It is necessary for the Society to keep an extra stencil on file for each variation in the name and address the company uses when ordering, even though the change is slight. Since we have no means of knowing which is correct, we must use the address last sent in. Of course, the Society is glad to keep these stencils if such is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font3"> and an aid to the brethren in the field. Pioneer groups in isolated territory can assist in this same matter by having all orders come to the same one of their group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies should not request literature to be charged to them at pioneer rates, even though it is being ordered for pioneers. All company orders are charged at company rates. The pioneer obtains his literature from the company at pioneer rates, whether campaign literature or something ordered specially for him, and the company will in turn be credited through the Literature Credit Bequest Form (SC-53). If it places a burden on the company to order cash items for pioneers, the pioneer can order these himself and send his order with the company’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When company and pioneer orders are sent together, however, it should be kept in mind that there should be a remittance form for each order even though only one check or money order is sent for the entire amount. The remittance forms will show what part of the remittance to apply to each order. Bemember, too, that the new remittance form (S-52) should accompany </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all cash item orders,</span><span class="font3"> regardless of size, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">including those for handbills. If</span><span class="font3"> you are not sure whether the Item you are ordering is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> cash Item, please consult the Cost List, where you will find cash items defined and a list given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Occasionally pioneer orders have been delayed when the Society was not notified that the one to whom the order was to be shipped had moved, or when a pioneer sister got married and neglected to advise us of her change of name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Careful attention to the matter of ordering, making sure to fill out the order blank carefully and completely and to include remittances when necessary, will assure better service and will eliminate much unnecessary correspondence between the Society and the companies and pioneers.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Stress </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">This world of Godlessness Is in an irreparable plight. It has become the miserable slave of its god Satan, and is totally void of faith and devotion to righteousness and the principles of God’s Word. Whoever may be responsible for tills condition, one thing is absolutely certain: The accusing finger of guilt cannot be pointed at the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses and the Society. As remarkably demonstrated by the thrilling year’s report in the 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses, </span><span class="font3">the ministry of God’s servants stands blameless, “giving no offence in any thing.” Yes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">blameless</span><span class="font3"> because the Society has consistently endeavored to fulfill its charge as “faithful and wise servant” in providing “meat in due season”; and because you, the publisher, have faithfully accepted your responsibility as minister of God and have carried the vital Kingdom truths to men of good-will throughout the world. Now comes February 1949 and the “Blameless Ministry” Testimony Period; another opportunity to minister, “giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God.”—2 Corinthians 6:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this second big month of the 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, God’s blameless ministers will continue to hold forth the message of life and deliverance from a destruction-destined world. How? By offering a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> for two dollars, and giving as a premium with the dual-subscription offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> or some other bound book, and a booklet. When placing the offer, it is suggested that the publisher inform the obtainer that he will count it a privilege to call back in order to make certain that the magazines are being received, and answer any questions that might arise. Good-will persons truly appreciate this display of sincere interest in directing them to a knowledge of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember &quot;Watchtower” Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to fully prove ourselves as the ministers of God and show a blameless ministry in “all things”, we must not fail to call back on subscribers and extend that helping hand so much desired and needed by those who say, in effect: “How can I understand except some man should guide me?” How can they, indeed? The admonition, therefore, is: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Make Watchtower back-calls. </span><span class="font3">They are essential. Wherever possible the publisher obtaining the subscription should make these back-calls. Call with a purpose, namely, to establish a home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or book study. Show genuine Interest in the subscription obtainer. Such propel<sup>-</sup> procedure on the part of the minister tends to dispel any doubts relative to Jehovah’s witnesses, and hence further establishes our blameless ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> expiration slips and good-will back-call slips are being sent by the Society to the companies. The back-call servant should see that these receive prompt attention by the local publishers. In this regard, it is suggested that as home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or book studies progress the publishers assist the students to recognize and appreciate the importance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the advantages in subscribing. This will also help them to see the desirability of renewing their subscriptions before these expire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Can Your Company Increase?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With a month of rousing activity “showing belief unto final salvation” in January, many subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will undoubtedly be obtained. Therefore, February will be a good time to reflect on January’s activity, analyzing what has been accomplished locally and how improvement can be effected during the remaining months of the campaign. Refreshing and instructive </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign field experiences will also be of real value. Publishers who have been successful in obtaining subscriptions may be used to relate their experiences, particularly those which will assist other ministers in their presentation of the offer. Keep the importance of the eleventh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign in full view throughout the entire four months. Remain subscription-conscious I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s proven ministers possess and preach the singular message of hope and salvation. Theirs is the only ministry that can stand blameless before God and the world. Let us maintain our proven ministry during the “Blameless Ministry” Testimony Period, in February, “in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1949 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Calendar to Aid in Meeting Quota </span><span class="font3">In the interests of expanded world praise, the 1948 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> declared: “There Is much singing yet to be done. As each one keeps his place within the Lord’s organization and sings, certainly the praises of God will be heard among all nations.” And heard they were! Uniting under the yeartext, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations,” thousands of singers spread the song of praise, in 96 different lands. And with what result? The amazing number of 260,756 ministers of God engaged in Theocratic ministry in 1948! A new world publisher peak!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this calendar year of expansion ended, the question arises, What now? Slack the hand? Rest on past increases and peaks? Expansion-minded ministers answer an emphatic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">No!</span><span class="font3"> Rather, each individual, each company will plan, organize and diligently work toward even greater peaks and thus swell the ever-increasing throng of praisegiving “nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Can Wa Meet the Quota of 10-Percent Increase?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is it possible for Jehovah's ministers to give more praise than they have in the past? Our new 1949 yeartext gives stirring answer: “I . . . will yet praise thee more and more.” (Ps. 71:14) Yes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font3"> praise, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more </span><span class="font3">gospel-preaching by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font3"> ministers in 19491 In fact, a 10-pereent increase in number of ministers is our quota for this service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By God’s grace, that quota has already been exceeded in the United States, during October. But exceeding the quota one month will not assure the average for the year. With keen appreciation for our new quota of 10-percent increase, let each individual minister resolve: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I . . . </span><span class="font3">will yet praise thee </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more,” </span><span class="font3">and then </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font3"> just that. Take an active interest In the quota locally and do it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now!</span><span class="font3"> Do not wait till the last few summer months. Compare your own activity with that of the company, and frequently ask yourself: “Am I contributing to the fullest extent that I can to aid the company in its endeavor to meet the new quota?” If not, praise “more and more”. Become thoroughly familiar with your company’s chart on which the quotas are posted. Study it; learn to know the company quotas. Realize that the chart is not just a maze of figures, but a precise measuring rod of Theocratic expansion in your company. During the 1949 service year it will visibly mark your progress toward meeting the 10-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the combined efforts of individual praisers with a personal interest in local quotas, coupled with Jehovah’s spirit, that will make for a 10-percent increase in number of publishers in the United States for the entire service year. Ministers of God the wide world over have consistently proved this to be true in 1948. Thrilling beyond words are the reports of increase from our brethren in the far-flung corners of the earth. Consider: In Germany, 15,856 ministers of Jehovah set an individual quota of assisting one goodwill person to enter the ministry of praise during the 1948 service year. By Jehovah’s grace and through perseverance, the witnesses in that land enjoyed an 83-percent Increase, reaching an average of 29,172 publishers and a peak of 36,526 publish-l ers! In 1948 a 20-percent advance was made by our British brethren, with 14,676 ministers sharing each month in the song of praise, while Italy, that little country long deprived of the gospel song, had a 116-percent Increase. In Russia, a land where singing Jehovah’s praises brings banishment to Siberia or the firing squad, ministers of God Increased from 3,498 in 1947 to 8,000 in 1948, according to the best reports available; a 128-percent increase I Think of it! Also, the entire international Theocratic organization can rejoice, for the increase in average number of publishers was 27 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, what about the United States? Here a 7.7-percent advance was effected. This is good; but it shows we are far behind our brethren in other parts of the world. Can we not do better? Let us meet this challenge by making our 1949 quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1949 &quot;Yearbook&quot; and Calendar</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above reports and many others equally encouraging will make each one of us more diligent in our efforts to attain to the 10-percent increase as we read the thrilling world-ministry report by the Society's president in the 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font3"> With its highly informative and stirring contents, the 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> can be made the subject of discussion at service meetings, back-calls and book studies. Its outstanding record of increase after increase is a mighty testimony to the blameless ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses and can be readily incorporated in public talks. Read, study, analyze and review its contents; use it in your ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Closely allied with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font3">is the attractive 1949 service calendar. Its four-color aerial panoramic view of the world-renowned missionary school of Gilead reminds one of the great work that school is doing. Moreover, its theme of expanded praise will alert the minister to his own ministerial obligations and will serve to dally remind him of the 1949 10-percent increase in quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All indications point to the joyful fact that 1949 will be a record year of praise abundantly blessed by Jehovah. Let each minister of the Most High begin the year aright. How? Start now, in January, working for the quota of 10-percent increase and striving for a steady Increase in number of publishers thereafter. Let us each and every one declare before Jehovah in word and action will yet praise thee </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">more” </span><span class="font3">in 1949.</span></p>

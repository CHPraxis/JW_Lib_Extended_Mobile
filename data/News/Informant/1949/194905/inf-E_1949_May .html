<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Expanding Your Ministry </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3-Bound-Book Offer to Be Presented</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Increase Your Praise as a Pioneer</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Outdoor and Rural Public Meetings Increase </span><span class="font2">With a deep appreciation for the glorious light of the gospel and for the inestimable privilege that is ours in being Jehovah’s witnesses at this world’s end, each and every minister should seek to expand his ministry by now ‘praising more and more’. The Lord through his organization assists </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font2"> to increasingly serve him as his minister through ample provision for this individual expansion. Just consider:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Spiritual food so necessary for strong Theocratic growth is made available in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. Awake!</span><span class="font2"> keeps ministers abreast of the times, provides material useful in Kingdom service. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">gives practical counsel on ways and means of advancing praise and expanding your ministry. Weekly company meetings and other assemblies are arranged for enlarging your Theocratic education. Circuit servants visit all companies and assist in increasing local field activity. Now, to further expansion through orderly and unified action, efficient, comprehensive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization for Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font2"> is provided. And the Lord through his Word establishes the various features of public praising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As God’s minister, you have these varied provisions available for your use. Therefore, “attend to these duties, let them absorb you, so that all men may note your progress.” (1 Tim. 4:15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font2"> By all means </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">expand</span><span class="font2"> your ministry!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kingdom publishers will ‘let men note their progress’ in May through an extensive bound-book campaign. The offer will be the three latest bound books and the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind, </span><span class="font2">on a $1.00 contribution. Instructive demonstrations should be arranged to “put you always in remembrance” of the various ways to present the offer. When offering the literature, be alert to any situation. And remember: An engaging smile and a pleasant introduction oftentimes gain a hearing ear. Reflect genuine interest in the one to whom you are ministering. Display patience when confronted with an “I’m busy” or “I’m not interested”. Tactfully refute such objections and proceed to “put your message attractively, yet pointedly” with an enthusiastic and convincing delivery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you talking about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;?</span><span class="font2"> Then highlight such features as the explanation of the Biblical account of creation ; where we are in the stream of time or how the Bible was produced. Truly the Bible truths contained in this volume break the fetters of worldly ignorance and open wide the only way to real freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Or are you discussing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”?</span><span class="font2"> Reference can be made to the current conflict for survival between man-made systems, showing that the only lasting government is God’s kingdom, which offers the remedy for all human ills. This book gives a detailed account of that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Ood Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> call attention to the truths regarding man. What is a soul? Who made the Devil, and why does God not destroy him? Why are so many prayers unanswered? And what is the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses? This Bible textbook brushes aside the plague of worldly propaganda in favor of Godly truth and the path to life-giving knowledge is made bright. All publishers are encouraged to try these and similar suggestions in field activity and realize their practical value in gospel presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, with the placement of literature the minister assumes the obligation and privilege of keeping a personal record of placements and then cultivating the interest by making back-calls. Home Bible studies continue to be sought after by each minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The possibilities of expanding your ministry through the public meeting activity are great when viewed in the light of public meeting attendance at recent circuit assemblies throughout the country. Just study these figures showing Saturday evening attendance compared with public meeting attendance: 1,101-2,551; 840-1,914; 633-1,638; 593 -1,004; 191 - 418. Does not the public’s attendance at these meetings reveal the prospects for expansion in the United States? Every company and publisher should lend support to developing this interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to arranging for public meetings at Kingdom Halls, at the company book studies, public halls and schools, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">outdoor</span><span class="font2"> meetings can now be planned. Private yards, vacant lots, ball fields and public parks are a few of the locations that can be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rural</span><span class="font2"> public meeting work will afford many companies the opportunity to expand their ministry into their rural territory. Many persons living in these rural communities cannot take time to travel to the towns or cities to attend public meetings, because of chores and other responsibilities, but can attend a near-by meeting in a schoolhouse, community hall or a neighbor’s yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely, then, progress in May will be noted by all men if you as a Kingdom publisher “attend to these duties, let them absorb you”, thus expanding your ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Upon surveying the works of men, wise King Solomon was inspired to conclude that all things done by men are but vanity, the single exception being the service one renders to Jehovah. Having the riches of a king, a dominion, the conveniences of life and all that the world of that day could offer served only to convince him further that proper service to Jehovah was the only work of lasting benefit to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we approach the time when Jehovah will completely destroy the works of vanity and wickedness, consecrated servants understand with greater appreciation the import of King Solomon’s conclusion. Following the example set by the Greater than Solomon, Christ Jesus, they shun the temptations to further entangle themselves with the things of this world, which serve to weight them down and hinder them in giving proper service to the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Desiring to sing Jehovah’s praises “more and more” and to take advantage of every opportunity to expand their ministry, many publishers are joining the ranks of the full-time ministers. But the call still goes out for more, for truly the harvest is great. The need for pioneers is great the world over and daily requests are made by companies for pioneer assistance. In fact, all companies could very effectively use the services of more pioneers in caring for the Kingdom interests assigned them. In addition to this, much isolated territory is in need of pioneer attention. At present there are in the United States more than 1,400 cities with a population of 4,000 or more without a local company organization to properly take care of the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Start Now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the need is so great and so</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Cost List</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> the Society is sending the new Cost List; one for each pioneer and two for each company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is important that the company servant and stock servant carefully study the instructions on how to order which appear in the first few pages of the booklet. If pioneers order direct from the Society they should also follow these instructions. many good-will persons desire to know the truth, the possibility of becoming a pioneer is again presented before all servants with the hope that at least 10 percent of the publishers will become pioneers. By exercising strong determination and putting complete trust in Jehovah, would it not be possible for you to begin pioneering now? or, if not immediately, within a short time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Approach with confidence all the problems that the Devil puts forth to discourage you, knowing that Jehovah will bless your efforts as you keep working toward the pioneer goal. Thousands who are pioneering testify in “questionnaires” recently sent them that, though confronted at the start and still faced with problems of one sort or another, the power of Jehovah has been marvelously manifested in their behalf day after day. And the Lord will continue to shower down his blessings upon these and new pioneers as they keep singing his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has promised you that the necessities to continue in Kingdom service will be provided. By making wise use of these provisions and by planning your affairs to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">stay </span><span class="font2">in pioneer service, undue concern need not be given to your means of livelihood. At times you may be tested in this regard; but treat it as another test of your integrity and exercise greater faith in Jehovah. Do not fear that he will forsake you in time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those desiring to enter vacation pioneer service are encouraged to send early and request </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vacation pioneer application</span><span class="font2"> blanks in order that they may begin serving their Creator full-time promptly after school closes. Ministers, young and old, join now in singing Jehovah’s praises in the full-time pioneer service!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bound Volumes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Many companies have inquired whether they could obtain bound volumes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> For the benefit of companies that would like to have such volumes for their libraries, copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> for 1947 and 1948 have been bound, each magazine in a separate volume for each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies desiring copies should order Immediately, specifying the magazine and year wanted. Remittance of $2.00 per volume should accompany the order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Only a limited number of these volumes have been bound. When the supply of 1947 and 1948 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> volumes is exhausted, the remaining orders will be put down for 1949 issues. It will be appreciated if any company or publisher desiring 1949 issues will likewise order immediately, remitting $2.00 per volume, so that the Society can better determine the number of copies to save for binding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Contending for the Faith” Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">June to Be a Back-Call Month</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Three-Bound-Book Offer Continued</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In view of the evil times now prevailing, how imperative It is that everyone who has the faith of God’s kingdom be found earnestly, courageously and unceasingly ‘contending for that faith’! How can this be done? By taking the offensive and pushing the advance of true worship! During June, the “Contending fob the Faith” Testimony Period, we will use as aggressive instruments the three latest bound books together with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of one dollar.—Jude 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Contending at the Doors</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first place for using these weapons is at the doors of the people. With some this may mean first contending with themselves and overcoming a tendency to fear man or to love ease. Arriving at the doors of the people we must use the instruments effectively. That requires tactfulness, that sensitive mental discernment that will enable us to present the message attractively. Call attention to the truths that you think will especially appeal to the one to whom you are speaking. Point out the value of the scripture and subject indexes and tell them of your willingness to aid them to understand these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As you go from door to door seek to apply the lessons recently studied in the Theocratic ministry school on “Oral Emphasis”, “Modulation,” “Confidence and Poise,” and, above all, put your heart into your presentation. Remember, that is the most effective manner of speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">June a Back-Call Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Contending for the faith is not limited to the door. God’s ministers must also contend for the faith inside the homes of the people by means of back-calls and Bible stud</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Actual-Count Inventory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In harmony with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization</span><span class="font2"> all companies take an actual-count inventory on March 1 and on September 1. Only the September 1 inventory, at the beginning of the service year, is reported to the Society, however. Forms will be sent for this purpose at that time.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Gifts and Wills</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">From time to time brethren who own property and who have much or little of this world's goods have inquired of the Society as to how they can see to it that their property is disposed of according to their wishes when they die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society’s legal counsel has prepared a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum on Oifts and Wills</span><span class="font2"> which will be of great aid to any individual who wants to see to it that someone else will not dictate what shall be done with his possessions after his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This notice is not a solicitation of funds on the part of the Society, but rather a notice to the brethren that the Society will be glad to have its legal counsel advise you as to how to make proper provision so that your wishes will be carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you write the Society concerning gifts and wills, state your problem fully and the Society’s legal counsel will give whatever additional advice is necessary along with a copy of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum. </span><span class="font2">ies. Hence the Society is designating June as a “back-call month”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Make back-calls on recent magazine subscribers, on former subscribers for whom you have received expiration slips from the Society, and on obtalners of books and booklets. Call back promptly and keep the initial interest created warm and alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In calling back we should be as well prepared and as resourceful as we are in our house-to-house activity. Instead of merely asking if they have read the literature or have any questions, engage in friendly conversation, suggest questions and endeavor to ascertain just where their interest lies, if you do not know this from previous contact. Then stimulate that interest by showing how the literature answers these questions. If the one with whom the literature was placed is not at home and someone else is, then witness to him. By being alert to make use of all opportunities to make back-calls, surely each company publisher can reach the company quota of back-calls and many will exceed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our goal in making back-calls is, of course, the conducting of a home Bible study. One pioneer recently wrote that she had started a number of home Bible studies without placing a single book. It happened that the interested ones had previously obtained literature from others and gladly consented to a Bible study when the pioneer called. Take full advantage of your opportunities ! Home Bible studies can be started if we will put forth diligent efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During June let each one who has the faith of God’s kingdom contend earnestly for that faith at the doors, in the homes and on the streets. Fight shoulder to shoulder with your brethren and aid others to join the ranks of courageous contenders for the faith.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1949 District Assemblies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The first of the 1949 district assemblies will be held in May, with others following in quick succession. All assembly cities appear by district in the April </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> except for one in District 5, which will be in Lincoln, Nebraska, July 15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Be There?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Make plans now to attend your assembly, and share in its blessings. The public talk will be “It Is Later than You Think!” This timely discourse will prove a blessing to you and to all those of good-will who hear it. Take full advantage of the opportunity to minister to the people of the convention city by going supplied with literature and witnessing equipment. And before you go it will be well to read again the article on district assemblies in the April </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Assembly time is here! Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States will be joyfully gathering together. Will you be among them?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Student Talks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">School servants and circuit servants should note that student talks are from the current issue, not from the magazines of a year ago. If the issue is not yet available at the time assignments are made, the talks can be designated on the circuit assembly program as “Selection from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower&quot;</span><span class="font2"> or “Selection from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake !”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Expand </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">“In one day the company placed more magazines than in the entire previous month!” So declares a circuit servant report, commenting on the results of the company’s first “Magazine Day”. Undoubtedly as “Magazine Day” becomes an established feature of every company, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> will be read by more and more persons. The expanded distribution will bring Jehovah’s kingdom more prominently into public view, and help Increased numbers of the reading public to find hope and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Setting aside one day for magazine work does not cancel out distribution of magazines at other times when convenient. On the company’s magazine day, however, a concerted effort will be put forth by the entire company, including pioneers, to get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> into the hands of the people, from house to house, store to store, and on the streets. Public meeting advertising will be carried on in conjunction with magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting the Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brief magazine witness to a householder or storekeeper will usually be best. For example, after introducing himself, the publisher might say: “Today the Bible is being pushed more and more into the background. Actually, however, it is more important to know its contents than ever before. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">turns its readers to the Bible, where they can find comfort and hope. The leading article in this latest Issue is ..................... I will be very happy to leave this copy with you; it is five cents.” Or, if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> is featured: “This magazine is devoted to the spreading of truth. It will help you to be informed about what is taking place in the world. Its articles are factual, and varied, as you will notice by glancing at the titles. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">is not political, commercial, or religious. You may have this latest issue for five cents.” A number of short, arousing presentations can be developed. Coverage of more territory and placement of more magazines will assuredly result. Try to build a magazine route, with the same householders or storekeepers obtaining magazines regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the streets, ministers ought to be alert to witness and distribute magazines at every opportunity. Call out slogans in an enthusiastic, yet conversational and Theocratic way. Many have increased placements by approaching people standing about. In a quiet, poised manner inquire, “Have you read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?&quot;</span><span class="font2"> Whether “yes” or “no” is the reply, a brief magazine testimony can follow, and a favorable response will often result. Cleanliness, a dignified, pleasant appearance, and confidence, on the part of each publisher will add to the effectiveness of magazine day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is suggested that each company establish a quota of at least five magazines per publisher per week. This does not mean that each one will be expected to take five copies of each issue. The company will order according to its needs, so that magazines will not accumulate. But publishers can be encouraged and helped to improve their magazine service, so as to reach or exceed this quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Favorable reports from companies nation-wide point to the Lord’s</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Handbill Order Blank</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">A new handbill order blank has been provided, supplies of which are now being included with each order of handbills. When your supply is received you should discard the old blanks and use the new ones henceforth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As many as five talks can be ordered on one of the new blanks, provided there is no change in hall address or quantity. If you do not want the same number of handbills for all of the talks, or if the hall address is different in some cases, it will be necessary to use a separate order blank for each change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Handbills for f o r e i g n-language talks, like those in English, should always be ordered by the company and the order be checked and signed by both the company servant and the assistant company servant. It should be kept in mind that a complete translation of the entire front of the handbill must be furnished for foreign-language handbills. Since there is no space for this on the order blank itself, please fill the order blank out in English and attach to it a separate sheet with the proper translation. It will be helpful if you will note the language in the upper right-hand corner of the order blank if the handbills are for a language other than English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society appreciates the cooperation of the brethren in ordering handbills sufficiently in advance to avoid the necessity of rush handling of their orders. This is best assured if the orders•are received by the Society a month before you require them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">All companies or units that are not incorporated and that own their own halls should inspect the deeds to their property to ascertain whether or not the hall was deeded to the company or unit or to trustees for the company or unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the name of an unincorporated company or unit was used in the deed without specifying the name or names of individuals as trustees, the title is defective and correction deeds should be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Any unincorporated company that owns a Kingdom Hall the title to which is not held by trustees should communicate with the legal department about the matter. Enclose with the letter a copy of the deed to the property on which the Kingdom Hall is located.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">blessing upon magazine-day service. If your company has not yet set aside a magazine day, it is suggested that you do so immediately. Service meeting dis'cussions, with suitable demonstrations, will be helpful. The circuit servant will assist you, also. Make magazine day work to Jehovah’s praise and the benefit of good-will in your territory by wholehearted publisher support.</span></p>

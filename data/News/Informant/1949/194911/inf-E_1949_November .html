<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Featured</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you want God’s favor and life everlasting? Then you must advance to perfection of maturity. The ability to advance is inherent in every one of us. Fed first with milk and then solid food, a newborn babe will grow to maturity. Fed first with easily-grasped fundamental truths and then weightier Bible doctrines, the Christian will as a natural consequence advance. He becomes a mature minister, able to &quot;preach the word”, to refute arguments, to stand firm against assaults, to nourish others. This will help him to win God’s approval and find life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Feeding upon God’s Word must be a regular practice in our advance to perfection of maturity. To become slothful in study habits, satisfied with past knowledge, is dangerous. The unfed infant will neither advance nor remain a child. It will die. The consecrated person, if spiritually unfed, will neither advance nor remain infantile in knowledge. He will waste away to certain death. For our eternal good, we ought to meditate upon and give continual heed to Paul’s admonition at Hebrews 6:1: “Therefore leaving the [first] principles of the doctrine of Christ, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">let us go on unto perfection;</span><span class="font3"> not laying again the foundation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Thousands Advance to Maturity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All Kingdom publishers will aid others to advance to maturity during November by presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let </span><span class="font3">God </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind</span><span class="font3"> on a 35c contribution. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> has already aided thousands to advance to maturity. In August, 1946, when it was released, only 60,420 publishers were engaged in Kingdom proclamation ; but after three years of widespread distribution of this useful textbook, in August, 1949, we saw the all-time high of 91,463 Kingdom publishers! Surely </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> played an important role in this splendid progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Alert ministers will approach each door as a prospective sheep-location, having something definite in mind to say. A few well-chosen sentences to fit each situation will be much more effective than an oft-repeated, cut-and-dried recitation. Lessons 48 and 50 in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font3"> furnish splendid information refuting those common objections and excuses that arise. Tactfully endeavor to overcome such and really </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">present</span><span class="font3"> the message. Illustrate the value of the book in answering questions, and point out the significance and importance of the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls to Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each book placement is a potential Bible study. The person of goodwill possesses the book; now the publisher’s privilege is to transfer the life-giving truths printed there</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">in to the recesses of mind and heart, thus effecting the first step in the advance to perfection of maturity. To do this back-calls are necessary. On return visits prove to the goodwill person your sincere concern for his spiritual growth. Urge him to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and list any questions for consideration on your subsequent call. Such back-calls will continue regularly as the publisher works toward establishing a home Bible study. When people already possessing the book are met, endeavor to arouse interest anew in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> for the purpose of starting a Bible study. Be Biblestudy conscious! It is the tried and proven way to aid the immature to maturity. (For helpful information on home Bible studies see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font3"> lessons 46 and 47.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Often it is heard, “The person with whom I have my Bible study just doesn’t seem to advance toward maturity. Not only does the study drag, but I have difficulty broaching the matter of service and meeting attendance.” Perhaps self-examination will reveal the cause. Ask yourself : Do I thoroughly prepare each lesson? Do I arrive at the appointed time and conduct my study regularly? Do I conduct an enthusiastic and interesting study? Do I stick to the subject under consideration? Do I draw out comment of the student to help him make the material his own? Do I tactfully point out God’s requirement of service and meeting attendance when they are mentioned in the subject matter? Do I avoid overstaying my visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, do not overlook examining the one with whom you are studying to make certain the “seed” is planted in “good soil” and that there is a desire to advance to maturity. If a person desires further study after finishing one book, continue the study. By the publisher’s being alert and properly conducting the study, the Bible student will make continued advancement on the road to maturity and ultimately will begin to serve Jehovah in the field; or he will relapse to the point where the study should obviously be discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another requirement in our spiritual growth is meeting attendance. Just as in approaching the doors of the people, so in attending meetings, we must have the right mental attitude. Why does one attend meetings? The logical answer is, to advance to maturity. Hence, in order to realize a full measure of benefit from the meetings, one must participate by commenting and carrying out his other assignments, such as parts on the service meeting program and instruction talks. Conductors of meetings will encourage more of the brethren to comment where audience participation is called for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this counsel clearly in mind,'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The pioneer checkup has been made and the results tabulated. This information, given below, will be of the greatest personal interest to each pioneer as he notes in which group he finds himself. Additionally, each company publisher will be keenly interested, well knowing the vital part that the pioneers have in the expansion of true worship, both by deed and by example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To us, the results present a very encouraging picture. When we consider the obligations of the pioneer, the quota of 100 hours, personal study, and perhaps family and company-service obligations, as well as the many unforeseen circumstances that may arise, we rejoice to learn that more than 72 percent of the pioneers met or exceeded the minimum requirement. Nine percent averaged from 94 to 99 hours a month. These were encouraged to try to fully meet the requirements during the coming year by working just a little harder or planning a little more carefully. The remaining 19 percent will be given another six months to improve their time, with the exception of a small number whose circumstances and reports were such that they are being notified of their transfer to the company publisher ranks. Of the special pioneers, all but 19 met the minimum requirements.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Testimony Cards</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Testimony cards have been employed by the witnesses in their work during past years to a varying degree depending upon circumstances encountered in the field, and, to some extent, the ability of the individual to verbally present the Kingdom message. In addition, the back of the card has served as a means of identifying consecrated brethren as being ministers of the gospel and representatives of the Watchtower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As so effectively pointed out in the January, 1948, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> however, any identification that we might present in the form of a printed card or other document is far less effective and valuable than the identification that actually marks a Christian as being different from those of the world. Like the apostle Paul, we do not need letters of recommendation written by men to prove we are ministers. Men of good-will who have heard the truth from our lips are living epistles or letters; letters “written not in ink, but in the spirit of the living God, and not on tablets of stone, but on the human heart”. (2 Cor. 3:1-3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) </span><span class="font3">Christian works and the fruits they bear are the most eloquent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">form of </span><span class="font3">identification Jehovah’s witnesses could have. Each witness should let each minister unite with his fellow servants in co-operating in all company service matters and participate in every feature of Kingdom activity. So doing he will continue his “advance to perfection of maturity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the foregoing it is seen that the Society is dealing with pioneers with full consideration to individual circumstances and is giving them the greatest possible opportunity to measure up to the requirements consistent with its policy regarding the requirements of the full-time ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fully aware that the Lord has so arranged that the greater the publisher’s part in the expansion work, the greater will be his safety and joy, the Society will continue to encourage more and more company publishers to enter the full-time ministry, and will continue to aid them in every way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are you a pioneer? Then press forward with diligence and zeal, looking ever to the wisdom which comes from above to guide you, always setting your goal beyond the minimum requirements. Are you a companv publisher? Then be ever on the lookout for the door to full-time service to open for you, in the meantime doing your best to use all your gifts and every opportunity to the praise of Jehovah God. (Pioneers: Be sure that you always fill in your name on your report card and for legibility </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">print</span><span class="font3"> it. A report without a name cannot be entered on your service record.) also be able to show from the Scriptures that he is an ordained minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For these reasons, the Society will no longer print identification backs on the testimony cards. Any cards with backs that may now be on hand with the Society or in companies may be used as though they were blank. Testimony cards with blank backs may be printed from time to time by the Society to care for the needs of those who want to use this means of introducing the literature, or to assist in overcoming peculiar circumstances that sometimes arise in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is believed, however, that since the inauguration of the Theocratic ministry school most of the witnesses are now capable of presenting the Kingdom message without the aid of the testimony card. They are encouraged to do this because, in the majority of cases, a verbal testimony is most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In some countries identification cards must be furnished to persons going from door to door. However, this is not necessary in the majority of countries.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Do Not Use Mailboxes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Postal regulations require that only mail upon which proper postage has been paid and delivered by employees of the postal service can be placed in mailboxes. Under no circumstances should handbills, magazines or other publications be placed in mailboxes by the brethren. Difficulty can be avoided by calling this to the attention of the publishers from time to time so that all are properly instructed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Yet More Praise”</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Our Goal: A New Peak o</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>All Servants United in Praise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Men, in their lack of faith, look to the leaders of this world for guidance and laud them for keeping this world’s systems of greed together. But praising men and trusting in their schemes has brought no hope to humankind. In contrast with this, praise to Jehovah by his witnesses echoes around the earth and is bringing real hope to men of all nations. The Kingdom message, showing forth Jehovah’s promise of life in the New World, is comforting thousands daily; and these men of good-will are joining with the already great throng of true worshipers to proclaim as did David, “I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more.”—Ps. 71:34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.</span><span class="font3">F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes. the hope of God-fearing men is in Jehovah and they desire to increase their praise of his mighty works and liis salvation. That is why Jehovah's witnesses have eagerly sought to ‘yet praise him more and more’ in harmony with the text chosen for the year 1949. Time after time they responded to the appeal of the text, and repeatedly Jehovah gave visible manifestation of his approval upon their concerted efforts. New peaks of publishers, proof that Jehovah is now gathering his people through the work done by his witnesses, have been reached four times during 1949, five times during the service year. As Jehovah's praise is taken up by these new enthusiastic publishers what joy it must bring to the Creator I They are sharing in the vindication of his name. For the same reason their activity brings joy to us and we look ever forward to the reaching of new publisher peaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Yet More Praise”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fittingly, the service text chosen for the December testimony period, bringing to a close the 1949 calendar year, calls for &quot;Yet More Praise”. How better can we bring more praise to Jehovah than by striving for another new peak of publishers? An easy task? No, not at all. We all well remember the effort that was required to reach peaks in the past; but does anyone begrudge that effort? Far from it! So, to the work again, getting busy to see that all who appreciate Jehovah’s provisions for men of good-will have opportunity to join in singing his praises during the month. Diligent planning and zeal for Jehovah's service by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font3"> servant of God will make possible a new peak which</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">will be a grand climax for the y ear.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Our schedules will call for engaging in every feature of service activity. The offer will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kinydom Hope of All Mankind</span><span class="font3"> (or another book and booklet), on a contribution of 35c. Presenting the magazines on the street and from house to house, making back-calls on those who show interest, and conducting home Bible studies will keep the Theocratic minister busy throughout the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">New peaks can be reached in many companies simply by getting all of the publishers out into the service during the month. A check of the publisher record file will reveal who have not been in the service before the 15th of the month, and these can be assisted to have a part in giving ‘yet more praise’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">New publishers still requiring</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">counsel and encouragement should States or the</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Publishers in December</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">also be aided. Although they have been out in the service now, it should not be assumed that they can stand without a word of encouragement, an invitation or a helping hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And what about that good-will person with whom you are holding a home Bible study? Why not invite him to attend the local company meetings where you can acquaint him further with the preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses? Point out to him his privilege of sharing the knowledge he has gained with others by joining you in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. Do not overlook anyone who is a potential publisher. Peaks, after all, are made up of a combined total of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Youthful servants should also be encouraged to praise their Creator. Participation in the Theocratic ministry school serves to encourage the young as well as the old and aids them to develop proper appreciation for Kingdom service. Exercising proper guidance, parents can instruct their children in rendering effective praise and maintaining proper decorum in the Lord's service. December will be a good month for them to render “yet more praise” because of the holidays, and parents can do much to encourage their children to use this time profitably by furnishing them a proper example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Joyful and effective praise comes from united praisers. Hence, cooperation on the part of all is essential. Servants, looking well to the positions of service given them, will maintain a consistent course of aiding their brethren and setting the proper example. Earnestness and enthusiasm, inspired by the desire to see Jehovah’s praise increase, will serve to motivate others to join with them in God’s service. Publishers, thankful for such assistance given them in their service to Jehovah, will co-operate to the best of their ability by participating in the arrangements made for service. Each publisher should keep in mind the company quota of hours and endeavor to reach or exceed this during the month. And remember, the little things count, too, such as turning in your reports promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unitedly, then, we will work toward attaining a new peak of publishers in December, for we know that more praisers means “yet more praise” to Jehovah and this leads to “more and more” people of goodwill learning of Jehovah's righteous provision of everlasting life.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Release Dates</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">In order for the brethren to have' their magazines in ample time for | distribution on magazine day the Society mails them out well in advance of the date of issue. Usually it is best to have all of these dated magazines distributed before the date of issue. In other words. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-, tower</span><span class="font3"> dated the 1st of the month should all lie distributed before the 1st; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> dated the 22nd should all be distributed before the 22nd.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Of course, if this is not possible, then you should distribute them as near to the date of issue as you can. For the most part, then, we will be working with one magazine every week of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems good to establish starting dates for distributing magazines so that no company in the United</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">world will</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Distributors Magazines</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Magazine distribution is now an integral part of our witnessing activity. The provision for obtaining distributors’ copies of the magazines helps to assure the company of a regular supply with which to carry on its work, and it is gratifying to see more companies taking advantage of this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only is the regular receipt of the distributors’ copies of the magazines essential for the publishers who have planned their activity to include magazine work, but delay results in disappointment for the people who are depending upon obtaining the magazines on the streets or through personal delivery. Too frequently magazines sent to the companies are delayed because the one to whom they are addressed neglects to notify both the Society and the post office when his address is changed. Often the magazines are sent back to the Society by the post office, which also means additional and needless expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Simply writing that the address of the advertising servant is changed is not sufficient, for in many instances the advertising servant is not the one to whom the magazines are sent. For this same reason the Society does not automatically change the address of the company's magazines when a new advertising servant is appointed. Those responsible for the magazines should </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font3"> use the Magazine Distributors’ Order Blank (S-66) when the address to which the company magazines are to be sent is changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to notifying the Society of such changes, when a servant leaves the company or moves he should go to the post office and make arrangements for the proper handling of the magazines, so tnat those already in the mail will not be returned to the Society while the change is going through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a company fails to receive distributors magazines the Society usually credits the magazine account for those magazines. When writing about magazines you failed to receive, always state whether you want the magazines sent or you simply desire the adjustment to be made in your magazine account.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When a subscriber fails to renew his subscription his address stencil is imprinted on a slip which the Society sends to the company. This enables a witness to call personally and assist the former subscriber to realize the value of having </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> coming regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every reasonable effort should be made to call upon each of these persons. It should not be assumed that there is no interest. Many subscriptions are obtained from people who simply neglected to renew although they still enjoy the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the individual cannot be found after a reasonable amount of effort, or if he shows no further interest in obtaining the magazines, the slip may be destroyed. The stencil, which is the last record the Society has of the subscriber, is discarded when the slip is made; so no report on the uninterested is required to make the Society’s records complete. Slips for people living outside your territory may be returned; but if a card is enclosed asking you to contact them, please endeavor to do so before sending the slips back.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Checking Accounts Statements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">When statements of your literature and magazine accounts are received from the Society, the accounts servant should check them carefully as soon as possible. It appears that a few’ have not been doing this, causing difficulty later on if a discrepancy occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bear in mind, when checking your magazine account statement, that the charges are always one month ahead of the credits. The magazines charged on any magazine statement are the issues for the month stamped in the upper right-hand corner, unless otherwise indicated. For example, the statement with the date “June, 1949” stamped in the upper right-hand corner lists charges for the June 1 and 15 issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the June 8 and 22 issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> But your remittance for those June issues of the magazines is sent in during the first ten days of the next month, and is entered on your statement for July. Thus, if you have always sent in the exact amount due for magazines received, your June statement will show a balance due equal to the cost of magazines charged on the June statement, which is proper. Of course, on the company's records the remittance for magazines received during June would be entered along with the charges for the June issues of the magazines. The company’s records should therefore show a balance of &quot;none” while the statement from the Society shows a balance</span></p>

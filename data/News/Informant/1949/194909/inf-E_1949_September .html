<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Booklet Offer to Be Presented</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">“Cultivate these [gifts], devote yourself to them, so that everyone will see your progress.” Develop your natural abilities for the ministry ! Peter recognized the desirability of this and, after being called from the fishing profession, he willingly developed his unused aptitudes in his assigned work. Jehovah rewarded him with the gift of improved or adequate ability for his new duties as a minister. Progress showed itself. Following Paul's remarkable conversion, he, too, cultivated his gifts aright, no longer misusing them to bring persecution upon the Lord's servants. Progress again was clearly seen. Today Jehovah’s witnesses will likewise devote themselves to cultivating gifts for the ministry. They so doing, everyone will see their progress; expanded praise will be in evidence. And what better time to become more conscious of “cultivating gifts for the ministry” than now, in September, the first month of the thrilling 1950 service year!—1 Tim. 4:14, 15, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivating Gifts from the Beginning</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Developing gifts for Theocratic service begins when the initial knowledge of life-giving Kingdom truth is obtained by the man of good-will. His willingness to improve brings increased knowledge and with it a desire to tell others the good things learned; and so he extends the gospel message to friends and neighbors. Questions arise. More study is required in order to locate proper answers. Aided by the holy spirit and the promptings of a willing heart, the man of good-will Is “cultivating gifts for the ministry”. Already progress is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Continued improvement will be seen as the man of good-will is assisted by alert ministers to associate with the local company. Systematic presentation of the gospel to a greater number of “neighbors” in door-to-door service will be encouraged, and personal instruction given. During September door-to-door activity for all publishers, new and old, will be the presentation of any seven booklets on a 25c contribution, or three on a contribution of 10c where seven are not available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each booklet placed during September affords an opportunity to engage in back-call and Bible-study activity for all publishers who have placed these booklets. Do not hesitate to enjoy such refreshing and instructive work because of limited knowledge. Use the opportunity to cultivate your ability in these fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In making neighborly return visits, endeavor to clear away the barriers to knowledge of Kingdom truth by answering perplexing questions first. Bible studies are thus started and eventually a study of the publications is undertaken. Also, with the distribution of thousands of booklets, many booklet studies can undoubtedly be arranged. These will prove very beneficial in dispensing truth, as paragraphs in the selected booklet are discussed, questions entertained and scriptures read. Concluding the booklet study, a study in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> can be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new publisher will unite with experienced ministers in doing other new things, including full support of public meeting activity, an enthusiastic share in all features of magazine day and other company service arrangements. The schedule of Kingdom proclaimers should necessarily include regular attendance at all company meetings. Full participation in the Theocratic ministry school should be outstanding, as ministers seek to improve natural abilities. Brothers not yet enrolled in the school will make every effort to take full advantage of the provision by enrolling. Students who have shown suflicient progress but who have not as yet had the opportunity of giving public talks might be used for the first time this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Continual Development Desired</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are no bounds for cultivating gifts for use in praising Jehovah. Pioneer service, a rounded-out ministry, offers splendid avenues for increasing praise: Gilead training, foreign missionary work and many other blessings. Doubtless many brethren can arrange their affairs to enter this branch of the ministry as the new service year begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For some the future may bring servant responsibilities. Develop your abilities for this service now and be in position to aid your brethren when the opportunity arises. Consecration symbolized by water baptism is the initial requirement, and then willingness to fulfill that vow and render greater service. Accept added privileges and opportunities to gain experience, however small they may be, and you will learn and advance to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Appointed servants in companies will seek to improve and perfect the gifts they possess as overseers. They will make a determined effort to do better by diligently performing their assigned duties more effectively. Finally, they will work in unity for advancement of Kingdom interests locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No matter what position we occupy in the Theocratic organization at present, be it man of good-will, company publisher, pioneer or servant, each of us possesses abilities that can be further developed for the ministry. September is a month for “cultivating gifts for the ministry”. Let us ‘devote ourselves to them’ and share in the month’s activity to the fullest extent.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Let Us Apply Valuable Instruction Received</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Returning from the district assemblies refreshed by joyful associations and strengthened by ‘meat in season’, Jehovah’s servants truly feel that once again they have proved Jehovah and that, true to His promise, he has indeed opened the windows of heaven and poured out upon them rich blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These blessings, however, were not poured out upon Jehovah’s servants solely for their own enjoyment, but also that in the coming days they might individually better carry out the resolve of the year-text “I . . . will yet praise thee more and more”. Most appropriate, therefore, was the opening discourse, “Praising More and More.” To do this effectively, we next learned, means “L<sup>T</sup>sing Your Education”, the best in the world, in every feature of the service, and, if at all possible, in the pioneer work, where one can make the most use of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘Praising more’ also means “Overcoming Barriers to Company Expansion”, be such barriers a negative attitude toward expansion or more real ones such as persecution, territory and transportation problems. These barriers can be overcome “by my spirit”, by faith, by zeal and by mutual co-operation. Also, company expansion will result if “Servants Feed the Flock” by conscientiously discharging their respective duties and by setting an example, both in brotherly kindness and in field witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Particularly pertinent to the as-semblj' theme of ‘praising more’ was the discourse “Living Up to the Name”. That means ‘studying to show ourselves approved', being alert to preach ‘in season and out of season’, ‘keeping unspotted from the world’ and ‘loving one another’. And. to aid us in praising still more effectively, instruction was given on “Making the Most of Theocratic Counsel” : “During the Circuit Servant Visit,” “At the Circuit Assembly” and “By Daily Application of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organisation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Be a Pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What better way of ‘praising more’ than by having more and more pioneers? More such full-time prais-ers are urgently needed; but just</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Company and Pioneer Supplies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Supplies for companies and pioneers for the coming service year are enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font1">They include: for companies, report cards for each month of the service year and Company Progressive Report Sheet; for pioneers, report cards for each month and Daily Record Sheets; for special pioneers, monthly Report and Allowance Request forms and Daily Record Sheets, and, for those who use them, report cards for the president’s office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no yearly report letter what is required to take the step? No, not a car and trailer, not a goodsized bank account, not youth and good health, but faith, zeal for the Lord’s work, and appreciation of the privilege. And it will continue to take faith, yes, and patient endurance, efficient personal organization and self-denial to continue in the pioneer service. But what grand blessings go with it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We received further edifying admonition in the talk “Exercising Love Toward One Another”, the gist of which was: ‘Though I be found “praising more and more”, unless I exercise love toward my brethren it profits me nothing.’ “With All Thy Getting, Get Understanding” showed the need of our having a proper understanding of our relationship to Jehovah and his visible organization if our increased praise is to meet with his approval, while “The Path of the Just” revealed how marvelously Jehovah has used that visible organization to lead us into ever-increasing light and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Praising More and More” means being “Fearless at the World’s End” in spite of persecution, because of abiding faith, perfect love and the fear of Jehovah; it means being “Prepared to Defend the Gospel” by having a good knowledge of the Scriptures and the law of the land as it applies to our work; and it means a strong determination to “Stick to Your Work”, letting neither pressure nor this world’s allurements turn us aside from Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Paralleling the warning message to the public “It Is Later than You Think I”—so well received—was the discourse to all consecrated servants of Jehovah on “Profitable Use of the Remaining Time”, wherein we were encouraged to make good use of God's patience by praising Him more and more right up to Armageddon. And while doing so let us ever keep uppermost in mind the responsibility, the dignity and the honor that go with our commission to be “Ambassadors of the Heavenly Government”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much additional instruction was received, all to the same helpful purpose, namely, to aid us in “Praising More and More”. Now let each one of us be diligent to apply this valuable instruction, all to Jehovah’s glory and our eternal welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">this year. It is suggested, however, that paragraphs 32 to 42 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organisation,</span><span class="font1"> which deal with the matter of reporting, be carefully considered at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since some companies and pioneers use remittance forms (S-52) less frequently than others, this form will no longer be sent with the year’s supplies. Please order the Remittance Form according to local needs. Keep a supply on hand and always use the newest form.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Preparation Essential</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">What international magazine stepped into public service in August, 1946? What magazine answers the rousing call for vital information to a fast-asleep world facing Armageddon? What magazine is free from the shackles of religion, politics and commerce—free to print the truth that sets men free? What magazine publishes varied articles showing the need of God’s kingdom? offers comfort to mourners by revealing the light of a new and better world just ahead? points men of good-will to their only hope, the Signal, Christ Jesus? It is none other than the unparalleled magazine of general Information, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake !’s</span><span class="font1"> service of presenting truth and rejecting error aids the reader to step through the gate to freedom and to view God’s provision for world relief, His Signal, as brought to our attention in Isaiah 62:10 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(An Amer. Trans.):</span><span class="font1"> “Pass through, pass through the gates, prepare the way of the people; grade up. grade up the highway, clear it of stones; raise a signal over the peoples.” By God’s grace Jehovah’s witnesses will be raising that Signal in October by presenting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">With enthusiasm we will present the offer of one year’s subscription for $1. No premium will be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> is published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">semimonthly </span><span class="font1">in Afrikaans, English and German ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">monthly</span><span class="font1"> in Danish, French, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian. All are $1 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As this campaign will last only one month, the company organization and each publisher therein must be prepared for action the very first day of the campaign. Are sufficient distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> on hand? Subscription slips and record sheets? Is territory lined up for proper coverage? and is the accounts servant ready to handle the subscriptions accurately and immediately? Are service meetings planned to keep the offer before the brethren throughout the month so that they will be subscription-conscious?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to get off to a good start, here is a suggestion for the last service meeting in September:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. Welcome and text. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 min.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">A servant and publisher discuss the publisher’s part in preparation; attending meetings, taking notes, study of current issues of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> magazine, lining up back-calls, planning time and co-operating with servants in company activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">6. Closing announcements. 4 ”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">These and other points on the</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">” Testimony Period </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One-Month Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">campaign can be elaborated on throughout the month. Each one on the service meeting program should prepare well so that all will benefit. It would be well to reconsider form S-90, How to Properly Handle Subscriptions. as well as the New Magazine Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Individual publisher preparation is also essential. The main preparation of the publisher is to have a heartfelt appreciation of his privilege as a minister. The mind directs the body, and if we are convinced of the importance of the message our heart will move us into the field. The quota of one subscription per publisher can easily be met if each one does his part. Raisers of the Signal, will you be ready to present </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> October first?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Magazine day activity will keep </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> before the minds of the people. Be prepared and alert to take subscriptions in street work, door-to-door and store-to-store work, and on magazine routes. Each person who takes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font1"> on routes can be encouraged to get it through the mail on a subscription basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seize every opportunity to present </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> in October; to your friend, neighbor, grocer and baker. Your back-calls should also be subscribers. Into all features of service we will go presenting the offer. If you as a publisher need aid in more effectively presenting the offer, seek assistance from the company servants. Are you convinced that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> is a magazine vital to the people? Then present it with conviction and enthusiasm ! Be awake yourself and help others to get awake by reading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Daily the Society receives many notices from the post office department requesting that subscriptions be canceled because the subscriber has moved without notifying either the Society or the post office of the new address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Henceforth, when such notices are received for subscriptions that have four or more months to run, the Society will notify the company in whose territory the subscriber formerly lived. It will be greatly appreciated if one of the local publishers will immediately check at the address given to see if the new address is available. This should be done even though the local company may not have originally sent in the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If it is found that the subscriber in question is still living at the same address, the card should be returned to the Society with a notation to that effect in the space provided on the card. In such cases it is also well to have the subscriber contact the postman to assure future delivery of the magazines. If a new address is obtained, it should be similarly forwarded to the Society.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Past Year Shows Great Expansion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">With confidence we can look forward to many blessings and privileges during the 1950 service year. But before we enter the new year, let us pause and examine the past year in retrospect, noting wherein we have progressed and also wherein we need to improve. This, in order that we may plan now to make 1950 even better than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reports received for the first ten months of the past service year indicate that we have not only maintained but even exceeded the quota of a 10-percent increase in number of publishers for that period of time. All will eagerly await the report in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> to see by just how much we exceeded the quota for the year. But how does progress in your local company compare? To what extent did it contribute toward this gratifying increase of praise throughout the nation? A check of the following points will help you to determine where you have done well and also where improvement is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Did the company increase 10 percent to meet the quota of publishers for the year? And how do other averages for the year, as shown on the chart, compare with the quotas?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Field Service Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">So that the brethren may have the use of the September </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">during the month of September it has been printed before the Bethel vacation period. Hence, the field service report for July could not be included. The reports for both July and August will appear in the October </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Expired Subscription Slips</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Every month the Society sends expired subscription slips to companies holding the proper territory. In event the subscribers are in isolated territory, their slips are sent to the nearest company. Therefore, when receiving these names, each company is urged to call on all it can reach, even though some may be out of your assignment. Return the slips to the Society only if it is impossible for any publisher or pioneer in the company to reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">for whatever help is required to get this done promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is always advisable for the individual subscriber to notify the Society of his change of address. Do not leave this matter to the local post office if you want to be sure of receiving your magazines without interruption. When filling in the Change of Address form be sure to list your name exactly as it appears on your latest address label ; designate whether the change is for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> or for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> or both; and give the key number which appears on the label or, if this is not available, the approximate expiration date, for each magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is always wise to call on new subscribers with the current issues of the magazines. However, if the first issue is not received through the mail within six weeks, please notify the Society to that effect, giving all information necessary to properly enter the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The co-operation of all the brethren will greatly facilitate this service rendered by the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Year Begins</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">If these were not met, no doubt an examination of the company’s arrangements for field service will reveal places for improvement. To what extent was the company’s territory covered and the interest therein followed up? What can be done to cover it more systematically, not only with the regular offers of literature and magazines but with public meetings? What percentage of the publishers made back-calls and conducted Bible studies? Have arrangements been made to assist those not participating in these most important features of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Showing love and consideration, can further plans be made to assist irregular and new publishers to be more regular in the service and in attending company meetings? How did meeting attendance compare with the total number of publishers? Has encouragement and assistance been extended to newly interested ones and those attending meetings irregularly to be present at each meeting to receive food from the Lord’s table?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have all the suggestions for improving your praise to Jehovah as contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Oryanivation</span><span class="font1"> been employed, both by the company and by individuals? Magazine day should now be operating smoothly, public meetings should have been scheduled at local company book-study locations, and the many other suggestions given in the booklet used to improve your company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Summing up, does an examination of past activity reveal progress in all features of the service and hence “more and more” praise rendered to Jehovah? Thoughtful checking will undoubtedly show how your company can improve, as well as reveal many encouraging prospects for the year ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The assistant company servant should compute the company’s averages, as well as the new quotas, and post these on the chart. The new quota of publishers will be 10 percent above the average number of publishers for the 1949 service year. Similarly, the new quota for total hours and total back-calls will be 10 percent over what these totals were for the previous year. The quotas of average number of hours and average number of back-calls per publisher are obtained by dividing the new quota of total hours and total back-calls by the new quota of publishers. The quota of Bible studies remains the same, 1 per publisher. It is suggested that only whole numbers be used when posting average number of publishers. Fractions of less than one-half should be dropped, but 1 whole number added if the fraction is one-half or over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Truly the service year ahead holds rich prospects: individual praise in our home territories, two visits from the circuit servant, two circuit assemblies, and the coming 1950 international convention for a fitting climax! Innumerable blessings are a certainty and surely the joy you receive as you assemble with your brethren from all nations will be enhanced by knowing that you had a full share in the expansion of true worship. Hence, if your company did not reach its 10-percent increase in number of publishers during the past service year, then seek to do so in 1950 by striving for it the very first month of the new service year and likewise each month thereafter.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Reflections on Circuit Activity to Date</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Field Offer Is One Book and Four Booklets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Imagine having as your friend the richest and most powerful person in the universe! A friend able to remove all your enemies, including disease and death, and deliver you into a future world of perfection as your eternal dwelling place. This is no imaginary friendship. As Jehovah’s witness you do have the allwise and powerful Sovereign of the whole world as your friend, and with Him the reigning King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You have no reason to fear a failure of God's promise, for Jehovah and Christ are trustworthy friends. Did not the Lord preserve his eight friends when all his enemies were drowned in the flood? Did not God by a miracle save the Israelites from demon-worshiping Egypt? Did not he deliver Into an eternal dwelling place his faithful Son, raising him from the grave? All this is an assurance that Jehovah through his living Son will sustain and preserve you, his servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To keep the friendship of God and Christ, something is required of you. Jesus said: “And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that, when it shall fall, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.” (Luke 16:9, A.S.L.) The “mammon of unrighteousness&quot;—use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font3"> to make friends of Jehovah and Christ Jesus. No, you cannot pay over money and buy their friendship and the surety of future life. But you can wisely use your substance in the work that God has ordained for his servants, the ministry of the Kingdom. Faithfulness in that service brings permanent rewards from your ‘trustworthy friends’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will You Be Doing in July?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What, then, will you be found doing during July? Squandering your finances, time and strength on things of no lasting value? Giving your “all” to unprofitable pursuits? Not if you are wise. As the servant of God, properly you will be found at the company meetings and in the field service, calling from house to house, making back-calls and having Bible studies and preaching in public places. All this will require some of your material substance. It will take energy and determination, tax your patience and test your integrity. But if you want to ‘make trustworthy friends’ for the future, if you truly love your Life-giver and his Son, you will be found actively sharing in the ministry to the fullest extent your circumstances will permit. In fact, you will make opportunities to serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You will find much joy and pleasure as you tell your neighbors about the bright future ahead, and encourage them to read of the promised New World in the Bible literature you will offer, a bound book and four booklets on the contribution of 50c. Trustworthy publishers will happily and promptly report their activity, so that the organization may know what work has been done by those seeking to “make friends” in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Others to ‘Make Trustworthy Friends'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely it is your wish that many more of the expected “great multitude” may yet come out of darkness, “make friends” of the Higher Powers, and find eternal life. You may be studying with some of these “sheep” now. Perhaps your Bible study has been in progress for six months or so, since the beginning of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> Campaign. Have you discussed the joys of active service, told of your experiences, explained what a privilege it is to give the life-message to others? It is possible that just a friendly invitation ‘Come with me' will prompt persons of good-will to join you in God's service and begin walking upon the one road to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you invited and offered to aid those with whom you study to come to the public and company meetings? Often meetings in themselves instill within truth-seekers a keen desire to become witnesses for Jehovah and Christ. Why not, then, during July, make a very special effort to help all interested persons to attend the meetings? Perhaps one of the service meetings can fittingly demonstrate “steps to making trustworthy friends”, illustrating how a student of God’s Word develops into a qualified minister. At the meetings, assist new ones to “make friends” with other publishers, and explain the meaning of various items in the Kingdom Hall, such as the company chart and yeartext. Then climax your help by going right into the field with these lovers of righteousness, giving practical training at the homes and on the streets. Do so with confidence and joy and full trust in God, for the new ones w’lll copy your example. Thus you help others to ‘make trustworthy friends’ for the future. And these become your close friends also; they will with gratitude remember your love, kindness, and help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no “future” in anything the old world has to offer. An endless future, however, awaits those who put trust in and serve God and Christ and the Kingdom. Make certain of living when the set time comes for God to destroy the wicked. Do this by ‘making trustworthy friends’ for the future, now. And in doing that you will be helping others to pursue the same wise course, with its eternal benefits.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Nation-wide Advances Made Since Start of Circuit Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">By this date each circuit has been served at least five times, both through circuit servant visits and the semiannual circuit assemblies. It will be of Interest, therefore, to reflect on the various features of our circuit activity to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some very remarkable and encouraging trends in evidence, which will make glad your heart. When the circuit arrangement started, in 1946, the average number of publishers per month was about 62,000. For 1949 we have thus far averaged over 80,0001 Undoubtedly the circuit activity played an important part in this good increase. In many sections public meeting attendance at circuit assemblies has eclipsed the Saturday attendance more than 100 percent. This is particularly true in the east, midwest and west. The public meeting activity of the various companies in the circuits has also increased approximately 60 percent. Home Bible studies have advanced 50 percent, and in some districts, particularly in the east, the expansion is well over 70 percent. The south, southwest and north have not been so effective in this branch of the service. Both servants and publishers in those areas, conscious of this condition, will undoubtedly take steps to meet it effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Quota and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting Attendance Merit Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 10 percent of the publishers in the pioneer service has not yet been realized. However, now, with the opening of the summer season, we expect this branch of the service to greatly increase. Many new pioneers are being enrolled and hundreds of vacation pioneers are raising their young voices in praise to Jehovah. These new pioneers will mark a great stride in meeting our goal of 10 percent. Every year many of these young pioneers who have completed school continue in their life’s vocation, the pioneer service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Held 6,270 </span><span class="font3">study, service meeting and Theocratic ministry school is running considerably behind what it should be. Only 67 percent, 54 percent and 47 percent of the total number of publishers respectively attend these meetings. The spiritual welfare and continual Theocratic growth of the Lord’s organization is dependent upon all publishers’ assembling together and collectively partaking of the food the Lord provides. This low percentage is a challenge to the brethren charged by the Lord with the oversight of the local Kingdom service, namely, district servants, circuit servants, servants in companies and study conductors, and it should be met and surmounted In the power and spirit of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday’s Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Saturday attendance at the circuit assembly does not reveal the same healthy progress that other features do. Many of the brethren may not appreciate the advantages accruing from the present Saturday program, providing for three 15-minute talks Saturday afternoon in addition to the instructive evening circuit activity meeting. Also the demonstrations and experiences Saturday morning and evening add materially to making Saturday a most profitable and instructive day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren with automobiles and available space are urged to take along publishers and good-will persons who desire to attend the assemblies but might otherwise miss out for lack of transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new circuit servant and district servant public talks are indeed vital and timely for our day. Support them in all ways. Attend district and circuit assemblies regularly. Consolidate the gains you have already made and improve the weak points, making our past experience a springboard for future advances in all features of our ministry of praise.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Vacation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Notice is now being given that the Bethel home, factory and office will be closed for vacation during the two-week period of August 6-21, inclusive, in order that all those concerned may plan accordingly and order needed literature and supplies in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All pioneers and companies desiring literature for use during this time will please send their orders at the latest by August 1, so as to avoid a last-minute rush. With the exception of report cards and subscriptions, as little correspondence as possible should be sent to the Society during this period, in that no orders will be filled or correspondence answered from August 6 to August 21. Circuit and district servants will have their vacation during the same two weeks.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Show Godly Patience in Aiding Others</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Patience is a quality of Jehovah that has worked for the everlasting benefit of man. Had he not exercised longsuffering in the case of sinful Adam we would not be alive today and have the grand privilege of serving the Lord. The patience of Jehovah during the days of Noah provided for the saving of eight persons, to our benefit. God’s patience in 1914-18 gave the unclean-lipped remnant the opportunity to be saved, and the “other sheep” opportunity to hear of the way of life, through their preaching. Great opposition has come upon the remnant and their good-will companions because of their firm stand for Jehovah's side of the issue. But tins is endured patiently for God's name’s sake, appreciating that if God had not so patiently endured the reproach of demons and men for almost six thousand years we would not be living today to serve the Lord. We will not count him a slow God if he exercises a little more patience in the days ahead so that others may hear of the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is not slow, but is exercising patience: and that patience works for our benefit as the apostle states: “Look upon our Lord's patience as salvation, just as our dear brother Paul . . . wrote you to do.” (2 Pet. 3:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font3"> The time of God’s final vindication is near and will not be delayed. In the remaining time we will take advantage of his patience and push the message of life into the four corners of the earth so that others may hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Expressing Gratitude for His Patience</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">August climaxes this service year in which we have enjoyed so many rich blessings of the Lord. All publishers and those people of good-will who have not already taken advantage of the ‘yet remaining time’ to express their gratitude will he out in the field offering one of the Society's bound books together with four booklets on a contribution of 50c and patiently following up all placements by back-calls. We shall want to make it the best month yet. All features of the service should be engaged in: public meetings in parks, halls and homes: house-to-house work: back-call and Biblestudy service ; and magazine-day activity. The vacation season will give many additional time for service. Most of us will have been stimulated by the district assemblies and will want to express our gratitude for them in God’s service. By a united service expression of appreciation for the blessings of the past year, we can surely reach a grand climax with another all-time high in number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Patient Aid to Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As God has been patient with us so we will want to exercise that same patience with others. Patience with those attending our studies will encourage them to publish. Patience with our brethren, especially those requiring help, will aid them into the service. A watchful check by the company servant and his assistants will reveal those needing help, and they or other capable pub</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">lishers can endeavor to patiently aid them. Pioneers may be used in this manner as they have opportunity. This is a feature of service that cannot be overstressed. Surely it would not be pleasing to God to find, patiently feed, and finally get new ones into the service, then neglect these persons. Sickness, opposition, irregular time of secular work, etc., may present obstacles to them. Our patient aid will help and encourage them to overcome these. A friendly call, a word of encouragement and an offer to Slid such one in the service means a great deal to them, and they will appreciate it. Such service is an obligation and a privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If a new peak is to climax our service year it means, too, that we must all work in unity. Patience with our brethren will work for unity, and unity works for Jehovah’s blessing and progress of the company and the organization as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So let us be diligent in August to express our gratitude for God's pa- 5 tience toward us, knowing that his ‘patience is meant for our salvation’. Let others know of God's patience. Let us lie in the service of the Lord in August and aid others into the service with us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting the Pioneer Hour Quota</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Among the favored of Jehovah's ministers in this time of the world's end are the pioneers. Theirs is the privilege of devoting more time to the advancement of the Kingdom interests and less time to the interests of the old world. Since it is “more blessed to give than to receive”, how blessed is their lot I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With pioneer privileges and blessings, however, go certain obligations in order to remain on the pioneer list, outstanding among which is the quota of 100 hours a month. For the first three months that this quota has been in effect the pioneers have averaged about 91 hours a month. An analysis of the report for May-shows that approximately- 35 percent of the pioneers came short of meeting the minimum quota. How can this condition be improved?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Organization Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To meet the pioneer quota requires faith in Jehovah, a burning zeal for his service, based on a keen appreciation of the pioneer privilege, and careful personal organization. It seems that particularly as regards the last-mentioned requirement many are coming short. To properly organize one must view everything in its relationship to his pioneer activity. He must plan the most efficient use of his time as w<sup>T</sup>ell as his energy- and means. He should not be content with merely striving</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine has announced that there will be an International Convention of Jehovah's witnesses in New York city from July 30 to August 6, 1950. The invitation has been extended to Jehovah’s witnesses and good-will persons throughout the world to attend this convention. It is hoped that many from outside of the United States will be able to attend: the more, the better. Some brethren have expressed their interest in arranging at their own expense for relatives and friends from other countries to visit New York during the summer of 1950 for the purpose of attending the convention. The Society will be pleased to lend such assistance as may be possible in connection with the obtaining of tem-' porary visas for those who wish to attend the convention. Of course, the Society cannot guarantee the financial status of persons coming from other lands. The brethren who apply for visas in other countries must be able to slate how much money- they have available for the trip and give Hie name and address of any- person who may be sponsoring them, if that information is requested by- a United States consul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Passage from Europe to the Unit-ed States for the summer of 1950 is now being heavily booked by tourists, and it lias been reported that most of the space is already- reserved. Therefore we wisii to emphasize the importance of beginning NOW to make travel arrangements, especially for those traveling from Europe. It may- be more enjoyable for the conventioners to make up groups for traveling, and those who wish to do that should write the local office of the Society and request space for passage soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society maintains Branch offices in the principal countries of tlie world now. The addresses of for the minimum of 100 hours, but should plan to reach it as soon as he can and then endeavor to exceed it as much as possible. And having planned to exceed his quota he will </span><span class="font0">still </span><span class="font3">be able to meet it should some unforeseen, unavoidable interruption occur. Just as the best defense is to advance, so the best way to make sure of reaching the quota is to seek to exceed the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To reach and to exceed the hour-quota, however, will require more than just careful planning. It will take self-discipline, ‘training in godliness.’ to stick to your planned schedule. Practice regularity in the matter of rising, studying, and other necessary matters. When circumstances arise that would interfere, ask yourself: Which is tlie more important? the more urgent? My pioneer ministry or this or that thing which would interrupt it? Do not let personal inclination, friend or foe relegate that ministry to a secondary- position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To serve as a pioneer is a blessed privilege, as the pioneers themselves will testify. It is our hope that “more and more&quot; will take hold of the privilege. And as all these aim not only to meet but to exceed the hour quota, “more and more” will be the number of “sheep” reached, and greater will be the witness, all to God’s glory. these offices appear on the last page of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font3"> If there is an office of the Society in the country, then persons traveling from that country should communicate with that office as soon as they have definitely decided that they- are going to arrange to attend the International Convention. The Society would like to know as soon as possible who will attend and whether passage is definitely booked or if there is any assistance needed in the arranging of visas. Should you desire to have information or help with regard to persons in countries not listed on the last page of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> you may write to Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very large crowd is expected in New York during the convention, and the rooming problem will be the greatest yet. If the Society’s Brooklyn office or Branch offices are informed of your plans they will be able to send the proper room request forms to the interested persons as soon as those forms are printed. Then the forms can be filled in and sent to the convention committee. through the Society's office, for special attention and handling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Feel free to write to the Society about any of your problems in connection with international travel to the 1950 International Convention.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>This Is</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>District Assembly Time</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Half of the district assemblies for 19-19 are over. But the beneficial effects and pleasant memories linger on in the minds and hearts of many thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses and good-will persons who gathered during May and June at Fort Worth, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Little Rock, Birmingham, Sacramento, and Raleigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, and once again expressions of joy and appreciation come from the lips of true worshipers. What is it that Christians crave in these “last days”? Strengthening spiritual food? Practical counsel for the ministry? Blessed fellowship one with another? Exhortation and encouragement from mature, steadfast ministers? All this and much more they received at the district assemblies, coming from the “giver of every good and perfect gift&quot;, the Arranger of Theocratic assemblies, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Six of the seven yet to lie held are scheduled for July. Springfield, Detroit, Portland, Indianapolis, I.iri-coin and Sioux Falls will play host to God's ministers. Will you be at the one in your locality? Will you too taste the joys and blessings certain to be experienced? Be there, if at all possible, prepared for a feast of good things. Remember, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">this is district assembly time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Czechoslovakia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to conditions in Czechoslovakia it would be wise for the brethren not to send any of the Society’s publications to Czechoslovakia. The Communistic regime in Czechoslovakia has seen fit to bring many trials and difficulties upon brethren who are in possession of literature published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. You may get your friends and relatives into trouble by mailing printed literature into that country.</span></p>

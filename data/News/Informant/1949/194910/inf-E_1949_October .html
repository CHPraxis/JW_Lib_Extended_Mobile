<p><span class="font2">“Raise a signal.” That was the positive command issued by Jehovah to the anointed remnant in 1919. (Isaiah 62:10, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) </span><span class="font2">It meant that by the widest publicity they must tell the world of the Signal's being immovably fixed on Mount Zion, since 1914. No slumbering now, as when in captivity to Babylon. But awake1 and exalt the Signal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> the nations, Jehovah’s glorious King Christ Jesus. And that they have done, lifting up the Signal to a position of great prominence to this year of 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">True, nations politically have rejected the Signal, favoring an abominable substitute of their own building, such as the U.N. Not all inhabitants of the nations, however, have followed that unwise course. Many have listened and rallied with gladness to the Signal, proving their allegiance to Christ and his kingdom now by actively joining in further “raising the Signal” before Armageddon. It is of utmost importance that all of us keep on uplifting that Signal, for it means salvation to those who hear and believe, and death at God’s hand to the stubborn and foolish who turn him down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">As subscriptions are obtained, be sure to note complete and accurate data on the slip. The accounts servant will check this carefully, also. Be sure to call back on each subscriber, with the two-fold purpose of making certain the magazine is received and of aiding the subscriber in getting further knowledge of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Each letter should be written legibly and each point stated briefly but clearly. The writer should always sign his name at the bottom of the letter. The company servant should sign all orders and letters for the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When publishers associated with a company wish to order literature, renew subscriptions or notify the Society of a change of address, it is best if the matter is handled through the company servant (using the forms provided by the Society) instead of individually, if this is possible.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Forms and Their Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The various forms have been signed for efficient handling in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">de-the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">office as well as to best meet your needs in the field. The latest remittance forms, subscription record sheets, handbill order blanks, etc., should always be used. The Change of Address form (L-201) should lie used whenever you move if you are a subscriber. Companies and pioneers should endeavor to keep a</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">reasonable supply of necessary forms on hand. If supplies </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">checked frequently forms can be ordered along with literature instead of separately when each one runs out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant should sign all forms, and his signature should certify that all entries are correct. I The total listed on the remittance form should correspond with the total remittance sent, and the addition on the form should be checked. When an error is found by the Society, not only must the correction be made but the company must also be notified to correct its records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Checks should preferably be made payable to the Society. If not, the check must be endorsed on the back by the one to whom it was made payable. Figures and written amounts on checks should always agree. Postal notes should be filled in both on the face and on the back. If this is not done the postal note is no safer than cash, because if lost anyone could write his name on the face of the postal note and cash it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since stencils are made from the subscription slip, the slips should be neat and easy to read. The subscription record sheet should correspond with the slips before they are sent in. Seldom should it be necessary in the office here to transfer information from the record sheet to the subscription slips because of incompleteness or illegibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Envelopes should show the complete return address of the sender, and pioneers should use the pink envelopes provided for them. If all of the correspondence is going to one particular department this may be noted on the outside of the envelope, as, Legal Desk, Convention Desk, etc. Subscriptions, orders, remittances and correspondence may be enclosed in the same envelope. The contents of all envelopes should be checked before mailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be well at this time to also consider Lesson 44, page 173, of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font2"> for further instruction relative to letter-writing. Attention to the above suggestions will be of valuable assistance to the Society in serving you.</span></p>

Demonstrations and a recital of experiences in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> work will also be profitable during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Truly, the people of earth who would live beyond this generation must be awakened to the most significant happening of our age, the appearance of Jehovah’s Signal.

<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies Stressed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advance! Go forward! That has been the watchword of God-fearing persons over centuries past. It is so in this day, on the threshold of a New World. As the light shines brighter and brighter and Jehovah’s work progresses, God’s teachable servants receive additional instructions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font2"> the work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to be done.</span><span class="font2"> Clear in our minds now is the necessity of obeying God’s command to proclaim his kingdom to the ends of the earth, in harmony with the lead taken by God's visible organization. Each servant of God should advance with the organization in knowledge and service. We must not stand still; and, by God's grace, we will not stand still but will advance from childhood and become men of maturity. That is what Paul meant when he stated: “Therefore leaving the [first] principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation.”—Heb. 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We should advance to maturity in the deeper things of God’s Word, which makes ever clearer the Kingdom hope. To do this we should set aside definite times for private study of the Bible, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">and other Scriptural publications. If we are to be efficient teachers of good-will persons we must be equipped. Attendance at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies, service meetings and the Theocratic ministry school is indispensable for advancement. Comment at meetings as opportunity affords and discuss the deeper things of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> with those more mature. By talking of the things you learn you will come to understand them better. So doing you will be advancing to maturity in knowledge, going beyond the foundation laid when learning the first principles of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advance In Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only should we advance in knowledge of the deeper things of God's Word, but we should also advance in our service to God. We | will do this in November with the ! offer of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font2"> i </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hope of All Mankind</span><span class="font2"> (or ! any other book and booklet) on a contribution of 35c. To the homes we will go, placing the book and then calling back and arranging home Bible studies so Kingdom seekers may learn the fundamental doctrines upon which to build their hope of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advancing in service may require securing greater freedom from other activities, such as secular work, if these are interfering with study and your field ministry. Hake time for Jehovah’s service in your lives. Look forward to the possibility of pioneer service. Worldly advancements tend to enslave and disappoint. Advancement in knowledge and service to God's kingdom, however, brings hope and contentment now and life everlasting in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Aid Others to Advance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the offer for November is not new, demonstrations on new ways of presenting the offer and developing good-will interest into home Bible studies can be profitably given at the service meeting. Each publisher placing a book should remember his responsibility to call</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">ever conscious of his views, and help him to advance. A study each week is what he needs. Aid him to attend the meetings at the company book study and Kingdom Hall and ultimately assist him into the active service. Aid children if they show interest. Sometimes parents become interested because of a study with the younger ones of the family. And give proper attention to elderly persons who desire to learn. God is no respecter of persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us not forget our weaker brethren and those new among us. The company should have arrangements for training these in the most important work of the ministry, home Bible studies. This can be done by individual attention by the more mature brethren. Taking them on back-calls with you, arranging studies and letting them conduct them, is an excellent way. Go back with them from time to time and see how they are advancing. This arrangement may be worked through the company book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just as parents should set the proper example for their children, so the more mature publishers should be examples to “babes” in the truth in study and service. Advancement will be in evidence as all publishers become more conscious of the seriousness of study and service to Jehovah with the great day of his vindication drawing nearer. If you do not have a schedule for study and service, we suggest you make one. We should utilize all features of the service to aid us in our ministry, and during November we will particularly strive to increase our home Bible studies, because through them our good-will neighbors advance more rapidly. Will you be conducting at least one home Bible study by the end of November?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Semiannual Pioneer Hour Checkup</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Jehovah's arrangement for the expansion of true worship in the earth the pioneers occupy a specially favored position. With that favored position go certain obligations, among which is the quota of 1,200 hours a year, counted from September 1 to August 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid pioneers in attaining their quota as well as to keep the pioneer list in truth and in fact a list of full-time publishers, a checkup is made on each pioneer's activity twice a year. This is now being done and each pioneer who has come short will receive a letter from the Society. Depending upon the extent that they have come short, pioneers are being encouraged to do a little better, in that the average number of hours per month has been around 95 instead of 100; admonished that they must improve their time if they would continue to enjoy the pioneer privilege, or advised of their removal from the pioneer list.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Attend Faithfully and Improve Your Ministry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">“It Is Nearer than They Think I” We, Jehovah's ministers, well know that to be a fact! And, since this world’s end is so near, how imperative that we not only devote all the time and energy we possibly can to the witness work, but that we also be ever alert to improve our ministry. One of the most valuable aids in making such progress is the Theocratic ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is being sent a new schedule for the school, listing Lessons 45 through 90 (the last) in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font2"> and student talks for the coming year. These coming lessons in this textbook will prove to be especially interesting and valuable. The careful study of the lessons on ■ &quot;Theocratic Activities&quot;, “Argumentation,” &quot;Bible Helps,” “Bible Translations&quot; and “Religion&quot; will enable each one of us to make good progress in knowledge that is invaluable in every feature of Kingdom activity. Resolve now to avoid missing a single meeting and also to always study the lessons in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Attendance at the School</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From attendance figures at hand it appears that some brethren do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of the school, or that other reasons exist to make the attendance low. We suggest that each company finding the attendance weak ascertain the cause and take steps to Increase it at this time. In some instances, changing the day for the school and service meeting, as from Thursday to Friday, has accomplished this, especially where children are in attendance. In other cases, the intermission between meetings has been eliminated, except for the singing of a song, with । good results. Or the ministry school ! might be scheduled first. Whether 3 or not such changes will be beneficial can he determined by each company locally. But whatever the time and arrangement of the meetings. effort and appreciation on the part of each publisher will largely determine the attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">School servants can add much to the value of the school by thoroughly preparing themselves so that they can constructively counsel on coverage of material as well as the delivery, to the edification of both pioneer service and express their desire to remain on the list. Appreciation, however, is not the only requirement. If those who fall far short are unable to demonstrate their appreciation by meeting the pioneer hour requirements, it will be necessary for them to be content to serve as company publishers, unless long years of service and physical infirmities make them eligible for the &quot;infirm'’ list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who hope to make pioneering their life work are. wherever possible, wise to keep a little ahead on their hours rather than let them drop behind. This will provide something upon which to draw ! should unforeseen circumstances, <sup>:</sup> such as illness, arise. Now is the time to begin making or exceeding your quota for the new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special pioneers will no longer be required to make the semiannual report on their territory. The report by the circuit servant is all that is required unless a change in assignment is thought advisable before he next visits the company. the student and the audience. Adhering to the two-minute limit for counsel will further help to make the school interesting. The school servant must learn to condense his remarks, pointing out just one or two points for commendation and one or two for Improvement. The regular use of the counsel sheet will make for consistent and constructive counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some sections of the country there seems to be a tendency to use slang when speaking from the platform. As pointed out in the lesson on “Vocabulary Building”, slang weakens one's language. The truth is beautiful and powerful; slang is rarely the proper medium for communicating it to others. School servants, especially, should be careful to set a good example in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The school is Jehovah’s provision to aid us in ‘advancing to maturity’. But unless the individual publisher does his part he will not make progress. You student speakers, accept your assignments. Is it an instruction talk? Make sure that you are fully acquainted with your subject and then give it extemporaneously, within the time allotted. Is it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font2">student talk? Prepare thoroughly, and then </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font2"> it, putting your all into it. And to all the company we say: Attend the school regularly, and prepare for and participate in the oral and written reviews.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Two Consecutive Peaks Conclude Service Year!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">As shown by the reports below, July witnessed a new all-time peak of 89.669 publishers, exceeding the previous peak in April by 2,047 publishers. Even more thrilling, however, is the report for August. With a total of 91,463 publishers in the field during the final month of the service year an interesting possibility strikes the mind. With diligent effort on the part of all, is it possible that there will be 100,000 publishers in the United States eagerly welcoming witnesses from other lands who come to attend the 1950 International Convention? Can it be done? Remember, August’s report already exceeds the quota set for the coming year. We will look for Jehovah’s continued blessing upon our expansion during the coming service year.</span></p>

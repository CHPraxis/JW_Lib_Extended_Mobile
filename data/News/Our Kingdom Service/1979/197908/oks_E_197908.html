</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Do we look for ways to work together with those whose opportunities to speak of Jehovah and his goodness are greatly limited due to some handicap or disability? There is hardly a congregation that does not have one or more individuals who are limited in what they can do because of some disability. There are many who are incapacitated physically because they are crippled, blind, deaf, or aged. While Jehovah is certainly pleased with their limited service, should we conclude that their desire to share fully is any less than ours?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> It is true with some that physical infirmities produce a greater awareness of Jehovah’s love and goodness, prompting the individual to want to do more. Such a person may look for greater opportunities to serve Jehovah, and with some assistance from others, this may be possible, with greater joy resulting to all. Would it not be a fine expression of loving interest to include such ones in our plans for service, being alert to opportunities to take them with us or assist them to participate? This is</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Service Overseer-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How He Can Help Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> As a result of recent adjustments in the arrangement for elders a service overseer will be coordinating all </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> field activity in the congregation. What does this tell us? For one thing it emphasizes the importance of preaching the good news and making disciples. Additionally, we see the need for improved leadership and participation in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> During recent visits of the circuit overseer, one elder was selected to serve as the service overseer. Thought was given to having a brother who is zealous for field service, who loves the preaching work and who is capable of assisting others in making disciples. By the end of August, all congrega-in line with our set goal to HELP ONE ANOTHER!</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PEAK IN </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">MEMORIXl</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ATTENDANCE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We are happy fo report that on April 11, 1979, the Memorial attendance was 1,335,268 in the United States. This is a 5.6% increase over last year—a genuine' cause for rejoicing! We pray that these hundreds of thousands of interested persons who ’ attended the Memorial this year will make further progress in their association with Jehovah's people. To that end, let us continue in our efforts to help them derive the greatest benefits from the spiritual provisions of the congregation.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> This thoughtfulness certainly harmonizes with the operation of Jehovah’s spirit, which permeates the Christian congregation. Paul explained that there are “many members, yet one body” and observed that there are “members of the body which seem to be weaker” due to limitations that could be of a physical nature. The result? “If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it.” The effort to assist such ones with “helpful services” draws the congregation together in love and amplifies the proclamation of the Kingdom message.—1 Cor. 12:19-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Can you think of some ways to do that? In one congregation there was a blind brother who was not entirely satisfied with what he was doing in Jehovah’s service. He wanted to do more. Sensing a need, another brother asked if there was some way he could assist. As things worked out, the blind brother was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font0">tions will have an assigned service overseer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> The service overseer is not given a lot of records to keep, so he is free to take the lead out in the field. He will need and should have the cooperation of all the elders and ministerial servants, who will share in the field service leadership just as shepherds go ahead of the flocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> He will care for the basic responsibilities assigned to the field overseer as outlined on pages 73-76 of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font0"> book. (However, field reports will be handled by the secretary.) He will give consideration to the field service arrangements throughout the week and see what improvements might be recommended to the body of elders. If some arrangements are not well supported, why is this the case? Should any adjustments be made? Is there a need for better leadership in some group (s) ? Is the maximum being done to provide assistance to those who want help in the service? How is the territory being covered? What can be done to help more conduct Bible studies? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>

Asks her if she would be willing to work with her for a day or two. depending on the need, when they are able to do so. She is agreeable; willingly offers to help. Scene </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font13"> Later, she approaches the other sister. Inquires how she is getting along and suggests the possibility of working together. Explains that she feels that preparing for service together with someone else and working with them would be mutually encouraging.

Both optimistic about the outcome. Scene </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">3:</span><span class="font13"> These two sisters are conversing with study conductor after the book study, relating experience they had in service.

<p><span class="font13">All of us can benefit from such a mutual Interchange of encouragement and the congregation is strengthened by the building up of its members.—Rom. 1:11, 12; Eph. 4:12, 13, 16.</span></p>

Can you imagine how it would be if people would follow the principles that are mentioned In the Bible citations that are listed here, like . . . [Read one or two on page 3.] There are many persons living today who are finding true enjoyment in life because of upholding the Bible’s definition of love. Also, this brochure explains how such a way of life is possible.

How did he do it? The helping brother took time each week to read the entire lesson out loud for him. He would accompany the blind one on the Bible study and read the questions. Being familiar with all the material, the blind brother was able to conduct a fine study, much to his joy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> In another congregation, several deaf ones became associated. There was no one to assist them as an interpreter, so a few of the young brothers and sisters were alert to this need and learned the sign language. They made a fine expression of their brotherly love by helping to convey the benefits of the meetings to such ones. They also arranged to take them along with them in the service, setting up opportunities on various calls where these deaf ones could express their hope to others. Needless to say, there was a mutual interchange of encouragement among all involved.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> A severely crippled sister found it almost impossible to get to the meetings or share in group arrangements for service. Several thoughtful publishers arranged to take turns recording congregation meetings so that she could get the benefits even though confined at home. Besides regular visits to give encouragement, they also helped her arrange things so as to share in the service. They provided her with names and addresses of interested persons to whom she could write and some of them she was even able to develop into Bible studies. There have been similar cases where the interested person has been brought to the bedside of the infirm one and the study was conducted there regularly. Other experiences tell of kindly publishers taking infirm ones along in a wheelchair when they do street work or when they work in apartment buildings where such ones can move about more easily from door to door. It takes a little more time and effort, but think of the far-reaching benefits of thus working together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> You likely can discover a wide variety of similar needs existing right in your own congregation. Do you have a foreign-speaking publisher with a language barrier? Is there some older brother or sister who needs a helping hand? What about those who might have a chronic ailment that permits service activity only under specialized conditions? If you give this matter some thought, you may be able to contribute toward helping your brother in a manner that can bring</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">® Much of his work of strengthening field service will be within the book study groups. Many, if not all, of the elders will be book study conductors, and having discussed and understood what is needed as a body of elders, they will be able to cooperate more readily and effectively with the service overseer in implementing and building support for field service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> The service overseer usually will conduct a book study, but once a month he will visit one of the other book study groups, showing particular interest in how the group is doing in the preaching work. (While he is away, his assistant will conduct the study.) With the study being reduced to 45 minutes during his visit, the service overseer will use the closing 15 minutes to encourage all in the group to appreciate their privilege of sharing the good news with others. In addition to working with publishers from house to house as he is able during the week, perhaps he can go with one or more on a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> The service overseer will serve continuously unless circumstances make it necessary for a replacement. If a change must be made, the body of elders will assign that responsibility to another elder and inform the congregation. At his next visit, the circuit overseer will show on his report to the Society which elder is currently serving in that position. The service overseer can take his regular turn as presiding overseer according to the local rotation schedule.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Planning our activity with a view to working together assures the incapacitated ones that “if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up.” It also gives real meaning to the proverb: “Friends always show their love. What are brothers for if not to share trouble?”—Eccl. 4:10; Prov. 17:17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Today’s English Version.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> While all of us equally share the responsibility to preach, we are not all equal in experience or abilities. (1 Cor. 12:29, 30) There are those who are new or lack experience. Some are limited due to education or language barriers. Others are particularly experienced in one feature of field service, but not in another. Naturally, we all desire to be capable and effective preachers of the good news. By sharing the benefits of our experience and capabilities with others, much happiness can result.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> The book study group arrangement is a fine provision for providing mutual help. Many publishers have experience and abilities that they can use to assist others in their group. In many cases, it is simply a matter of making known the need and asking them to assist. We suggest that each book study conductor give thought to some who may need a helping hand in the service, and those who might be willing and in the best position to give effective help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> When he has this in mind, perhaps the conductor can first approach the experienced publisher about working with one less experienced. For example, he might say to a sister: “Would you mind working with Sister---- for a day</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> If the experienced sister is agreeable, the conductor can suggest that she talk to the other sister about it, working out arrangements that would be suitable for them. In some cases, they might want to discuss such with the study conductor, as he may have suggestions on how to proceed. They can plan what would be most convenient in the way of preparing together, sharing in the service and following up interest.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> The conductor should take a real interest in the brothers by inquiring from time to time as to how they are getting along.

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “Simple, yet very instructive!” That is what many are saying about </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories. </span><span class="font0">Undoubtedly, this fine Bible study aid can help us reach many more sincere ones, both young and old, who have yet to understand the Bible’s message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Since many have been affected by the death of a loved one, you may wish to speak of the condition of the dead and the hope of the resurrection, tying in Psalm 146:4, 5 and Story 92 of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories </span><span class="font0">book.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> We might start our presentation like this: “Good day. As a neighbor of yours it is a pleasure to bring you some good news. All of us have experienced the loss of a close friend or relative in death. Perhaps you have wondered what has happened to such ones. [Allow time for comment.] God’s Word gives us hope in Psalm 146:4, 5. [Read.] How kind God is in giving hope both for those who have passed away in death and for those of us who are living. This picture [turn to Story 92] shows a resurrection that Christ Jesus performed not only for the young girl’s sake, but also for the joy of her parents. You can just imagine how happy those parents must have been. But this was not the only person Jesus resurrected. The last paragraph of this story shows that he resurrected the son of a widow and his good friend Lazarus. And note the good news mentioned in the last two sentences. [Read.] This publication is designed for young and old alike, to help us all better appreciate the love and concern that God has for us. We are offering it on a contribution of $2.00.” You may adapt this presentation to fit the circumstances.</span></p></li>

To provide good reading material for young people, I have found this publication to be of great assistance to parents and children alike. It helps them to learn about what God has promised for the future. [Turn to Story 115; read last sentence in paragraph one.] The publishers have made this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font0"> book with over 125 Bible-based illustrations [quickly thumb through the book] available at a very reasonable cost of $2.00.

<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Many have enjoyed fine experiences offering the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories </span><span class="font0">book informally. One sister reported placing copies by offering it to pediatricians, mentioning that it would be good reading for youngsters in the waiting room. A sister who offered the book at a nursery school was able to start a study with the children. Additionally, she placed 70 books with the children, their parents and their neighbors. The lady in charge of the nursery took 24 books for herself, her relatives and friends. Be alert to your opportunities to offer this easy-to-place book.</span></p></li>

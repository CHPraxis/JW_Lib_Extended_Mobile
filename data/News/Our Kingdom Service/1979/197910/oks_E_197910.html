<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1979</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 22, No. 10 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>tyeM.</span><span class="font9"> ‘EKingcfom </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">tyiM&amp;littS:</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font1"> was a busy summer for all of us, but a delightful one! The high point was the “Living Hope” conventions. There were 93 of them in the continental United States. Ten of these were in the Spanish language, two in French, one in Chinese, and at some assemblies, sessions were held in Korean, Japanese, Portuguese and Italian. The total peak attendance for all assemblies was 982,585 and there were 8,630 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Friday morning field service activity resulted in a good witness to local residents, businessmen, and, in some cases, city and government officials. And how timely the reminders on the program that we conduct ourselves properly in all affairs of life, keep separate from the world, draw close to God, hold fast our hope without wavering, help one another, and keep busy in the witness work. Indeed, during the whole program we were repeatedly encouraged to keep busy in the field, using well all opportunities to spread our living hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then there were those three outstanding releases, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on the Letter of James, Choosing the Best Way of Life,</span><span class="font1"> based on First and Second Peter, and the recording of the Bible book of Acts. Have you read the new publications yet? By all means do so before we begin our use of them in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the further training and strengthening of Jehovah’s people, arrangements have been made for all circuit and district overseers to meet together in two groups, each for a special two-week period of schooling provided by the Society from September 17 through October 13, 1979. These brothers will be going, through the Pioneer Service School course, a Kingdom Ministry School course, and discussing other matters having to do with their regular activities. Rep-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Zealously Preaching and Making Disciples</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Preaching the Kingdom message and making disciples constitute a fine work. So much so, that it is worthy of our whole-souled effort. Have you been giving it zealous support?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> What is zeal? For a Christian, it is an eagerness to pursue what is right, based on love of Jehovah and his requirements. A zealous person is active and ardent, alive with the truth. His zeal is like a fire within him, motivating him. His heart is in the preaching and disciple-making work. He looks for opportunities to preach.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ZEALOUS ONES IN BIBLE TIMES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Some Jews in the first century had “zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge.” (Rom. 10:2) Their zeal was misdirected. We must have zeal based on accurate knowledge to build faith and love for God. If our zeal is diminishing or we are lacking zeal, there are definite things we can do. Jehovah will fire us with zeal if we heighten our appreciation for him, if</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing We Care About Our Young People</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> A large percentage of the publishers in the Christian congregation are under 20 years of age. Public indifference, worldly pressures, materialism and sexual immorality are pressures being faced by these young people. What can we do to show that we care about them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Many youths who are now in Jehovah’s organization have ex-Eressed great appreciation for the elp that was given to them by different ones in the Christian congregation. An elder displayed interest in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> young brother by picking him up to go with him to work on the Kingdom Hall. This young brother remarked years later that “it was the interest and concern of this brother that helped me to have a deep appreciation for Jehovah and his organization.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The prime responsibility for training children, of course, rests with the parents. They are responsible for providing and arranging for recreation ana other activities of their children. However, all of us can show that we, too, care about our young people. How can we demonstrate our concern? we regularly attend the meetings, study, pray for his blessing, and make the effort to engage in the preaching and disciple-making work. Doing these things will put us in a position to be like Jeremiah who was zealous in carrying out his commission.—Jer. 20:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Concerning Jesus, it was said: “The zeal for your house will eat me up.” (Ps. 69:9; John 2:17) Jesus’ example of zeal had a powerful effect on his first-century apostles and disciples, as a reading of the book of Acts will reveal. Observing that the zeal of the Corinthian Christians had a good effect on those of Achaia, Paul declared: “Your zeal has stirred up the majority of them.”—2 Cor. 9:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Like the brothers in the Corinthian congregation, many of our brothers today are filled with zeal .and this sets a fine example for others. Consider this fine report we received from a congregation of 83 publishers. A total of 51 spent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN OTHERS DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> At our “Living Hope” District Conventions this summer there was a drama: “The Need of the Fatherless Boy—Can You Help Him?” That drama gave us some good suggestions of what elders and others can do even in small ways to show their concern for young ones in the Christian congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Since young people, too, are a part of the Christian congregation, how fine it would be for the elders to include one or two of them among those whom they converse with when at the meetings. Sometimes just saying “hello” or sharing a brief word of encouragement will suffice. But often there is a need for more extended comments, showing genuine interest and understanding. For example, elders might ask about activities at school, problems they may be facing, and then offer constructive suggestions to help them, if this is possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Concern for young people is shown by working with them in the field service on a regular basis. Their help can be enlisted in doing</span></p></li></ul>

Modern-day elders are much like Paul, who had many activities and matters occupying his time. (2 Cor. 11:28, 29) Yet, how did he feel about his weighty load in behalf of his brothers? (1 Tim. 1:12) Elders today feel the same and are grateful for the privilege of helping all spiritually. While accomplishments, at times, may not be as much as desired, there is the same determination that Paul expressed In spite of pressures. —2 Cor. 4:7, 8, 16.</span></p>

(Rom. 15:13) Enables Christians to endure with rejoicing^ no matter what conditions may be. (Rom. 12:12) Hope closely allied with love. (1 Cor. 3:10-15) We never want to lose tight grip on hope. Right foundation needed. Some, however, have become weak, lacking fire-resistant qualities. Some have allowed their worship, Including field service, to become routine, not motivated by deep love of neighbor and Jehovah. (Matt. 22:39) Weakened ones have allowed Ideas and qualities to be built into them that are like burnable materials. Some do not have a strong relationship with Jehovah. Endurance results in divine approval. (1 Cor. 15:58) There is a need for our faith to be tested. (Jas. 1:2-4) Urgent need for all of us to go on bearing fruit, Increasing in accurate knowledge, being made Sowerful in order to endure.—-Col. 1:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Teaching others about Jehovah and his purposes is an expression of our love for him and for those whom we teach. Whether we are young or old, new disciples or experienced ones, we should be joyfully teaching others what we learn. Yet, at times some are heard to say: “I wish I could start a study,” or “I don’t know what my problem is. I can find interested persons but I can’t seem to develop a study.” Have you talked with someone either in service or informally that you feel would respond to further discussion of the Bible so as to know Jehovah? If you do not feel able to follow through on the interest, how can you receive help? On the other hand, you may not have any calls to make. If you desire to have a study, how can you receive help?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> First, in your congregation book study group there may be someone who can help you to start studies. Your initial step may be to speak to the study conductor, who, with other conductors, now oversees the Bible study work. He may be able to help you personally. But to provide assistance for a period of time, he will likely ask someone with experience to assist you. The two of you will want to prepare together for making the return visit with the goal of starting a study. You can decide on the approach. Will you go right into the book, demonstrating the home Bible study arrangement? Or, do you see the further need to discuss points right from the Bible?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Zealously Preaching . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font1">a monthly average of 12 hours in the service; another 28 served as auxiliary pioneers, spending almost 56 hours on the average in the service, and four are serving as regular pioneers. The congregation as a whole made 845 return visits, conducted 68 Bible studies and placed over 1,600 pieces of literature. A ;month of zealous activity like that is encouraging to all of us, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WAYS ZEAL CAN BE SHOWN</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Zeal will motivate us to look for and to take every opportunity to preach the good news. In addition to sharing regularly with the congregation in group witnessing, we will be alert to witness informally, showing that we are alive with the truth. You may want to tion directly or just use the Bible, you and your partner can review how to assist the interested person, to locate scriptures in his own copy of the Bible. It may be that you will decide that your service companion will handle the call and that you will do the assisting. On the other hand, after you have prepared together, you may want to handle the call and ask your partner to give you his observations on how things were handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> While your goal is to start a study, use your judgment on how long to stay or how much material to cover. Observe the person’s interest. Generally it is best to allow him to absorb what is discussed and return later to discuss other scriptures or further paragraphs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> For following visits, prepare together which scriptures or paragraphs you will discuss with the person. If you decide to have your companion conduct the study for several times, plan together on ways that you can share. You might read and help the householder understand selected key scriptures. When you conduct the study with the householder, your partner can give helpful suggestions, such as when it is appro-Sriate to ask auxiliary questions, ow to keep the study lively, whet the appetite for the next study, and direct interest to the organization, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> By helping one another through the congregation book study arrangement, it may be that you, too, can enjoy the pleasure of conducting a regular Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">take literature with you to work, when you go shopping, or when you visit the doctor. Many fine experiences are enjoyed by zealous publishers who do so. And your zeal will motivate you to keep a record of the interest shown and regularly call back on interested ones in an effort to start Bible studies. Another way we can demonstrate our zeal is by encouraging irregular and inactive ones to join us in the field service. Having a schedule of service can also be an indication of zeal. Zeal is contagious.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> This month we will have many occasions to demonstrate our zeal for Jehovah by our preaching and disciple-making work. May we continue to be a “people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works.” —Titus 2:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using Magazines Wisely</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Many are the Scriptural truths we have learned or had clarified for us by information published in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">Do you find that you both anticipate and treasure each issue of the magazines? They contain information that helps us to be better Christians. We can heartily recommend them to others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, . V<sup>SE</sup> JHEM WELL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Many brothers and sisters set aside a day each week specifically to offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> from house to house and in public places. When doing house-to-house magazine witnessing, more can be accomplished if we arrange to call when the majority of people are at home. Street witnessing is another avenue that we can use. This can be done by approaching persons who are on the streets near shopping areas, waiting for public transportation, sitting in parks, and so forth. When doing so, show them an appealing article as you offer them the magazines. Some publishers have been observed simply standing or walking on the streets displaying the magazines but seldom speaking to those who pass. While there are some good results at times from doing street work this way, this may give the impression that we are just being impassive magazine vendors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The offer can be made simply by greeting a person and asking if he or she would like to read a particular article featured in the magazine. If there is interest, it may be that the conversation can be carried further. Many of our brothers and sisters are getting good results from such an approach and are encouraged by the fact that they are successfully talking to so many people. If you have an opportunity to use the Bible, do so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR ORDER</span></p>

Please review your weekly order and determine how many magazines you can distribute. We hope you can place all your magazines each week, or perhaps more, as you look for opportunities to place them. But be realistic. Adjust your order with the congregation so that you will not have too many or too few. If large amounts of magazines are accumulating at the Kingdom Hall, the body of elders should decide how to encourage more magazine work and if it is best to adjust the order of the congregation with the Society. Paper and postage are expensive, and much labor goes into getting magazines to the congregations. All of us want to use the magazines wisely.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Many of us have been leaving older issues at not-at-homes. This can continue to be done. However, if the congregation is experiencing problems because older issues frequently are left when people are not at home, we suggest that the local body of elders review the matter and make suggestions to the congregation that they feel will be most appropriate for the territory and in the best interest of the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> What can you do so that you will use your magazines effectively? (1) Endeavor to work with the magazines when more people are at home. (2) When working on the street, approach individuals, endeavoring to engage them in conversations when presenting the magazines. (3) If necessary, adjust your order so you will receive the number you can use effectively. May Jehovah bless your endeavors to make wise use of these two valuable publications.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">♦ Nicaragua: The brothers are in good spirits and are resuming their meetings and their preaching and teaching work. Throughout the period of violence, only three of our brothers lost their lives. Many were rendered homeless, but since they were for the most part tenants, the major loss was in the looting and destruction of their possessions. As to transportation, there is very little. Most buses are destroyed, roads are only now being repaired, and gasoline is very scarce. However, things are quickly being restored to order under the new government. Missionaries are returning to their assignments in the country after being away for a short time. And, happily, adequate arrangements are now being made to supply the urgent needs of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;£&gt; New peaks of publishers in June: Italy had 77,774 sharing in the preaching work. Spain reached 40,485 publishers; Zaire, 20,365 and Japan, 49,879. Japan thus had an average of six regular and seven auxiliary pioneers for each congregation.</span></p>

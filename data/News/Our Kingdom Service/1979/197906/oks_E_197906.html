<p><span class="font8">How Do You Support the Kingdom?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> How do subjects of God’s kingdom show that they truly support it? Aren’t they willing to do all that they can in behalf of that government?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> The Bible is replete with accounts telling how early Christians demonstrated their full support for the Kingdom. If it is the big thing in our lives, how do we show it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The Kingdom was so real to early Christians that some gave their lives in support of it. Many were flogged, others imprisoned, still others suffered near-deaths often. (Acts 5:40; 7:60; 8:1-4; 2 Cor. 11:22-27) Some sold their possessions and properties and donated the proceeds to advance the Kingdom interests. (Acts 2:45, 46) However, the “kingdom” at that time was ruling over only the anointed ones. (Col. 1:13) Since 1914 we have been living under “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,” which will shortly destroy the entire worldly system of things. Should we not be willing to do as much, if not more than those early Christians to support God’s kingdom? (Rev. 11:15; Ps. 110:3) How do </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">YOU</span><span class="font1"> support the Kingdom?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DAILY CONDUCT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> You may not be called upon to die for it, or suffer physical abuse. But all Kingdom subjects are required to demonstrate their</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Do Not Give Up in Doing What Is Fine</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Where God’s people were endeavoring to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem in Nehemiah’s day, a coalition of enemy forces conspired to cause a disturbance. They said: “We shall certainly kill them and put a stop to the work.” (Neh. 4:7-11) Surely the pressure was on! Did the Israelites stop the building work Jehovah wanted done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Not at all! God’s servants kept working with one hand, while warding off attack from the enemy with a sword in the other. (Neh. 4:17, 18) What courage they showed in not giving up the fine work Jehovah had assigned them to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PRESSURE IS ON!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> As in Nehemiah’s day, Satan is trying to “put a stop to the work” Jehovah is having done. He is bringing pressures on the entire world of mankind, but the particular target of his attack is God’s people. Surely the pressure is on!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Are not some of our brothers struggling under heavy financial burdens as the cost of living continually rises? Others are physically ill or have family members who support by the way they live. As a Kingdom supporter, each day should find you conforming your life more fully to the righteous laws and principles found in the Kingdom’s Lawbook, the Bible. Are you doing so? Are you hating what is bad and resisting pressures to act selfishly or to indulge in immorality?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Supporting God’s kingdom also includes being motivated by love, since our King emphasized that his followers would live by this new commandment of his. (John 13:34) Are you living by it? Are you doing positive things for your brothers—yes, for all persons as you are able?—1 Thess. 3:12; Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Another way we give our support to the Kingdom is by regularly attending and participating in the meetings provided for its subjects. We thus demonstrate our desire to take advantage of the educational provisions made by our Grand Instructor and the Master Teacher. (Isa. 30:20b; 54:13; Matt. 7:28, 29) Of course, full participation in this educational program of the Kingdom involves more than making a comment at meetings now and then. It also includes regularly doing our “homework” in preparation for meetings and field service. Has appreciation for the Kingdom </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 2) </span><span class="font1">are seriously ill. Dealing with children who may not respond readily to Biblical counsel can create very real pressures; even our own weaknesses sometimes plague us. And the pressures on some of our elders, who are caring for many responsibilities and problems in congregations, remind us of what confronted stalwart men back in Nehemiah’s day who were ‘guards by night and workers by day.’ (Neh. 4:22) So the question is: Will we give up in doing what is fine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> As an organization we can answer with a resounding NO! Our spiritual paradise has been fortified as with a wall built around it and the enemy will never be able to destroy it. But what about us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">individually?</span><span class="font1"> The records indicate that apparently some have need for greater balance, even as those Israelites of Nehemiah’s day worked with one hand and held a sword in the other. During the 1978 service year there were 37,487 who laid down the implements, so to speak, in the United States. They </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font1"> 7)</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 2 and general announcements. Have children bring their copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> to meeting next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Discussion on &quot;Young Men, Can You Accept This Special Privilege of Service?” to subtitle &quot;What Can You Do to Qualify?” Elder reviews this material with 3 or 4 young brothers on the platform. Read the scriptures quoted and contrast principle in Malachi 3:10 with privilege of Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">&quot;How Do You Support the Kingdom?” Base introductory comments on paragraphs 1-3, emphasizing the need for real commitment to Kingdom, even willingness to die for it. Highlight faithful example of apostles and other early Christians, raising the question as to whether our commitment is comparable. Cover remaining paragraphs thoroughly, having publishers explain how daily conduct, meetings and field service relate to support of Kingdom. Finally, stress how, in connection with “Living Hope” District Conventions, we can show whose kingdom we support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Service announcements. Song 90 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 73 and general announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">28 min: </span><span class="font11">Make Disciples out of Your Children. Interviews and demonstration with comments from audience on demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1 min.) Introductory talk. Ask question: &quot;How many children have a personal copy of this book—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories?”</span><span class="font11"> Have them raise their hands and show the book if they remembered to bring it. It is a wonderful provision to help young ones learn about Jehovah and his Word. Jesus said in Matthew 28:19, 20 to make disciples of people and to teach them. We do not want to overlook those of our own household, our children. They likewise should become disciples and speak openly of their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(16 min.) Invite couple to the platform who regularly study this publication with their children. If you would like to use two or three couples in this interview, you may do so. Ask them about the good results achieved, and how the book aids them in really teaching their children and not merely entertaining them. (Examples: Story 2 develops heartfelt love and appreciation for God and his provisions. Story 4 teaches the wrongness of stealing. Story 6 shows the terrible results of hate and anger, and how we should not be jealous of others.) How do they use the 'pictures in the book? What method is used to study it with children? Couple demonstrates study with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Get comments from audience about study, how it was conducted and what they liked about it. Have them comment about benefits of studying this publication with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Invite all young children to the platform and interview some of them. Have them bring their books. Ask them to show what they like about the book and what they have learned. Do they ever take the book to school? Do they talk to others about what they are learning? Do they speak to unbelieving family members? Has anyone started a study with someone else in this book? How do you conduct it since there are no questions at the bottom of the page ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1 min.) Help all to appreciate how this book is not only delightful to look at, having appealing pictures that make it easy to place, but also how it is a fine aid in teaching and making disciples. The praising of Jehovah by &quot;every breathing thing” includes our children. —Ps. 150:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Talk on &quot;Young Men, Can You Accept This Special Privilege of Service?” from “What Can You Do to Qualify?” to end of Insert. Please read section “What Can You Do to Qualify?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Service announcements. Song 110 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 29, general announcements and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Presenting the Good News— Wherever We Are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Cover paragraphs 1, 2 in brief introductory comments (3 min.). Arrange in advance for publishers to relate experiences in the article. Also, have audience tell their own experiences in informal witnessing. (Be sure to include young publishers.) Plan for certain publishers to bring up problems, stating why or under what circumstances they find informal witnessing difficult. Invite audience to offer suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Emphasize this: Be observant, alert to appropriate opportunities to share the good news with others. Do not expect to give a full witness to everyone, but .share Scriptural thoughts in a conversational way, and follow through with more information if interest is shown. Make it a practice to do this every day, wherever you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Rejoicing in Your Service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) We should be committed to Jehovah’s service. We cannot be in the world and try to be in the truth also and expect Jehovah’s approval. We must have the attitude of David when he prayed for Jehovah to unify his heart. (Ps. 86:11) Joy is sure to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(18 min.) Have congregation relate experiences about things that have made them joyful since they have begun serving Jehovah. Include as many as time allows, but have specifically prepared comments from an elder, ministerial servant, parent and a youth. Comments may be gotten on the joys of overseeing the “sheep,” observing the growth of the congregation, assisting with congregational duties, seeing children grow in knowledge of Jehovah and being given service privileges, giving presentations at the doors for the first time, seeing a new one progress to the point of baptism, seeing relatives take up the truth or similar causes for rejoicing in their life of service to Jehovah. Everyone should speak from the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min; </span><span class="font11">Discuss plans for field service. Encourage everyone to participate in some way this week. One congregation had 117 publishers engage in field service on a Saturday morning. Song 101 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 9, accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Keep on Obeying the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) Talk explaining just what obeying the truth means: To live in harmony with the teachings of Jesus; dedicating one’s life to God; being baptized; sharing the message of truth with others ; showing love for one another. (John 14:6, 15) Paul encouraged Galatians to keep on obeying truth. (Gal. 5:7) Need for perseverance, constant effort. He tells us to “keep on exhorting one another.” (Heb. 3:13) Today as in first century some do not continue sharing in Christian works. They become irregular in service and meeting attendance, or even inactive. Some elders and their families affected. No one is immune. With genuine concern, cite statistics of irregularity and inactivity of local congregation. Reporting may be a problem with some. However, others need loving assistance to actively obey truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(12 min.) Have brothers in audience read scriptures. Then ask questions and help them reason on these points, making practical and specific application to local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have Philippians 2:1-4 read. What are some of the things that Paul said would make his joy full? In what ways can we show concern for our fellow believers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have Philippians 2:12 read. How do we show that we obey and with what result in view?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What do Acts 15:36, Romans 1:11, 12 and 1 Thessalonians 5:11 show that we can do to help brothers? Have Psalm 71:17 read, what can parents do to help the youth? What can all of us do to be of more help to our younger brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have Romans 10:10 read. In our own family Bible discussion, why is reaching the heart so important? Emphasize how regular family consideration of daily text helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(4 min.) Family demonstrates consideration of daily text at evening meal. All briefly participate in commenting, with father asking questions. Let wife and children highlight main thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1 min.) Conclude showing need to make diligent efforts to help one another; to care for one’s family; to reach hearts and to motivate others to keep on obeying the truth.—Rom. 6: 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">“Do Not Give Up in Doing What Is Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Introductory talk based on article, followed by 12 minutes of interviews. Please select brothers and sisters beforehand according to the three groupings that follow. They should speak from the heart in a natural and upbuilding manner, having in mind something specific that has helped them not to give up in serving Jehovah. (1) Interview two or three who have served faithfully for many years. What pressures have they experienced and overcome? What helped them? Did prayer, meetings, personal study, field service, encouragement from others play a part? (2) Interview some who had become inactive in past, but were helped to be reactivated. Briefly, what contributed to their becoming inactive? What helped them to regain their balance and begin service again? Was shepherding by the elders a contributing factor? Did others encourage them? (3) Interview some who were irregular in past but who were helped to be regular in the field service. Also interview some children who are regular publishers. What has helped them to be regular in the field? Did encouragement by parents contribute? By others? What kind of encouragement do they feel young people need in order to be regular in field service? (Could touch on a mistake some parents make in trying to badger or drive their children to serve Jehovah instead of building love for God and desire to be pleasing to Jehovah.) Conclude with a 3-minute review of some of the points stated by those interviewed that aided them to endure.—Luke 21:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Published monthly by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 Our Kingdom Service (USPS 295-360) Second-class postage paid at Brooklyn, N.Y. Printed in U.S.A.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Young Men, Can You Accept This Special Privilege of Service?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13">( fVT </span><span class="font14">OU have your company of young men JL just like dewdrops.” (Ps. 110:3) These prophetic words show that Jehovah would have an army of willing young men to do a specific work at a particular period of time. The first part of the verse identifies that time as NOW, the time when Jehovah would display his “military force.” And what is the work of a “dewdrop”? Just as Jehovah provided literal dewdrops for the refreshment and life of vegetation, so he has provided symbolic dewdrops to serve for the refreshment and life of those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And as dewdrops are many, so today are the number of people who are offering themselves willingly. Yes, in just the last 10 years the number of those preaching the good news of God’s kingdom has almost doubled to over 2,000,000. And thousands more each month are dedicating their lives to Jehovah. This makes us very happy. But who will work to provide the Bible literature that is so important to sustaining'us all spiritually, and to furnish us the millions of Bibles, books, magazines and tracts that are so valuable in carrying on our Kingdom preaching? There is now a need for such workers. Can you offer yourself for this special privilege of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEED IS GREAT!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Brooklyn Bethel is the world headquarters of Jehovah’s people. Here a large contingent of young men print and ship the publications so needed by sheeplike persons around the w<sup>7</sup>orld. While a few sisters work in the Bethel home and offices, most of the jobs require strong, young men. So we are not encouraging sisters to apply at this time. But the need for young, single men continues to increase. We encourage such ones to ask themselves, ‘How do I feel about serving in such a unique manner, providing literature in many languages for use around the world in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work? Do I want to have the fullest possible share in this life-saving ministry by providing the needed Bibles, books and magazines? Am I, as a young dedicated brother, included among those described by the psalmist when he said: “Your people will offer themselves </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font14"> on the day of your military force”?’ —Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Presently at Watchtower Farms and Brooklyn Bethel there are 2,400 serving as a result of willingly volunteering themselves for this facet of Kingdom service. Like Isaiah they have said: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) Isaiah, already one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was not asking to be assigned to be a servant of God, but was volunteering for an </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">additional</span><span class="font14"> privilege of service. This was not to his advantage from a physical standpoint, nor would it be a comfortable assignment. No, it would mean sacrificing some personal advantages and comforts. Today many at Bethel serve under similar circumstances. They leave mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and friends. They say “Goodbye” to homes and comfortable surroundings. These sacrifices are willingly made for the “sake of the good news.” (Mark 10:29, 30) But in turn, what spiritual blessings and advantages they enjoy at the ‘house of God’! When one’s sacrifices are pleasing to God he promises to ‘open the floodgates of the heavens and empty out a blessing until there is no more want.’ (Mal. 3:10) Those serving at Bethel can verify the truthfulness of that promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL, LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What is life like at Bethel?' It is a wholesome and satisfying life. Some describe it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR KINGDOM SERViCE, JUNE 1979</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">as exciting. “When you are here at the hub of the worldwide activity there is never a dull moment,” is the way one brother put it. We continue to have representatives from the Society’s branches around the world coming to Bethel to attend the five-week Gilead Branch School course, and what a pleasure it is to hear their reports on the Kingdom activities in their countries. There is indeed an atmosphere for spiritual growth at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For example, Monday through Saturday mornings the day begins with a discussion of the Bible presided over by one of the governing body. Have not many brothers traveled miles to hear these brothers speak on various occasions? At Bethel each morning such ones encourage us with their remarks on a Scriptural text. During weeks that the Gilead Branch School is in session, the branch representatives give their reports at the breakfast table for all to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As an introduction to Bethel, some members of the governing body, and other mature brothers of the headquarters staff, give lectures dealing with various facets of Bethel life. Sometime during the first year you will likely attend a fine weekly Bible school designed to broaden your understanding of the Scriptures. New entrants also enjoy a special program of Bible reading, completing the entire Bible during the first year at Bethel. Those who have been through this course enjoy another arrangement for their spiritual edification, the Bethel family </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">’Watch-tower</span><span class="font14"> study. For this Monday night study, the Bethel family is divided up into various groups and elders at Bethel share in conducting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In addition to the activities at Bethel, everyone is assigned to a congregation. Here we experience firsthand the benefits of our work at Bethel. It helps'to keep us spiritually alert. By sharing with a congregation in the preaching work and attending meetings, members of the Bethel family have developed strong ties with these brothers and sisters in the local congregations. There are over 25,000 Witnesses in the New York City congregations with which Bethel family members serve.—Mark 10:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Most of the time and effort of the members of the Bethel family are spent doing that for which they volunteered. And this is to use their physical and mental resources in whatever assignment they are given here at Bethel. There is a great variety of things that need to be done. Some members operate printing presses or work in the bindery making books, while others cook, do laundry work, cleaning, farming, construction work, and so forth. Some have the responsibility of caring for the equipment in these departments. All of these work assignments involve enjoyable challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But life at Bethel is not all work, meetings, service and study. The family enjoys periods of relaxation at times as well. There is a variety of talent among those serving at Bethel, and so an occasional “Family Night” program of entertainment is appreciated by the entire family. There are opportunities for wholesome and upbuilding social visits with others. Some limited recreational facilities are provided. There are a number of libraries in the home where reading and research are done by brothers and sisters. And not to be forgotten are the pleasant conversations around the dining tables at mealtimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How do the brothers serving at Bethel feel about their privilege? One who has served here for several years says: “The work at Bethel is hard, but it is satisfying because it is accomplishing something worthwhile. Many people in the world have jobs but they seem to just work from day to day not knowing what is ahead, or what they want out of life. Before I came to Bethel, these few years would have seemed like such a long time, but now the time has gone by very rapidly as a result of seeing the good that my work results in to others.” He was 20 years old when he came to Bethel. Now, in addition to his Bethel privileges, he has been appointed as an elder in a congregation and is helping other young people to have this same spirit of willingness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN YOU DO TO QUALIFY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Bethel is a place where mature Christian men work to perform a service for fellow Christians throughout the world. It is not a place for boys, or those with serious spiritual deficiencies. It is not a “finishing school” for adolescents. Much like the young man Timothy who served with “an apostle of Christ Jesus,” so with any who are to serve at Bethel. (1 Tim. 1:1) They should have </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a good standing</span><span class="font14"> with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Acts 16:2 says of Timothy: “He was well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.” Even though he was young he also had an </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">interest in the Scriptures</span><span class="font14"> and was </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">well rooted in the truth.</span><span class="font14"> (2 Tim. 3:14, 15) So evident was his spirit of self-sacrifice and willingness to put the interests of the ' Kingdom ahead of his own that Paul could say of him in Philippians 2:20-22: “I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to you. For all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus. But you know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child with a father he slaved with me in furtherance of the good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A number of brothers have written or telephoned asking if they should prepare themselves for Bethel service by taking up special courses in study after high school such as in the data processing field or in other trades. Of course, one’s education is a personal matter on which he would have to decide. But to prepare oneself for Bethel service, a brother would want to gain experience in spiritual activities such as the auxiliary pioneer service or regular pioneer service. Thus for any young man to qualify for Bethel service and to truly have the spirit of Timothy would mean that there would be a need for him to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">center his life around the Kingdom</span><span class="font14"> before he comes to Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One who is at Bethel is not automatically protected from the spirit of the world. Through study of the Bible, regularity in the field service and association with mature ones in the congregation, one can grow spiritually and prepare for more responsibility. So there is the need for all to follow the counsel that the apostle Paul gave to the Colossian congregation: “Therefore, as you have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord, go on walking in union with him, rooted and being built up in him and being stabilized in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with faith in thanksgiving.” (Col. 2:6, 7) These are the kind of spiritual men needed at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Due to the nature of the work, one who is to serve at Bethel must also be in good health and physically strong. Also applicants for Bethel service in the United States should be either citizens of the United States or should have legal permanent residency in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Are you in a position to say, “Here I am! Send me”? If you are, and if you are a single brother 19 years of age or older, in good health and strong, willing and able to work hard, and are baptized for at least one year, then we encourage you to apply for Bethel. Write to the Watchtower Society, Attention: Personnel Committee, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, asking for a Bethel application, or obtain an application form from your circuit overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN ELDERS AND PARENTS DO?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In addition to being wholesome examples and associates for all in the congregation, it would be the proper Course for elders to especially encourage young men in their effort to expand their service to Jehovah. While Timothy no doubt exerted a very wholesome influence on the other young ones in the congregations of Lystra and Iconium, the elders did not hold him back from serving alongside the apostle Paul, feeling that he would be too great a loss to their congregation.—1 Tim. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the other hand, it would be a serious mistake for the elders to recommend for Bethel service a young man who does not truly qualify. Presently there are applications on hand of those who desire to serve at Bethel. However, not all are qualified and so not all can be accepted. At times it is quite apparent that the elders should not have recommended certain ones for Bethel at the time they did. This results in a difficult experience for the individual involved. In the past some have even had to be sent home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The better course is for the elders to help one to make the needed adjustments to qualify for Bethel. Perhaps giving him some assignment such as cleaning the Kingdom Hall or taking care of other tasks will help in this regard. Then if there are evident shortcomings either in the spirit displayed, or in his work habits, proper counsel and assistance may be given to help him to develop into a responsible, dependable brother. Of course, if the counsel is not received in a positive way, there would be no reason to believe that sending him to Bethel would help. Thus, while elders should encourage young brothers to serve at Bethel, it is important for them to stress the qualifications required for such service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Parents especially should have a positive influence for good on their children. One young brother who has been serving at Bethel for a few years states that he can remember his parents encouraging him toward full-time service from infancy. So when he turned 19 it was just his natural desire to reach out for Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There are many other examples showing the wholesome impact that the parents have on their children. The parents of Moses, Jochebed and Amram, give us a sterling example of this. Pharaoh’s daughter found the baby and claimed him for herself, but Moses’ own mother was asked to nurse him. Thus the child was taught the principles of true worship by his Hebrew parents. (Ex. 2:9, 10) Did not this early training help to qualify Moses for his very heavy responsibilities later? Hannah, Samuel’s mother, was also one who, by her course of conduct, ingrained the spirit of willing service in her son. Not only did she give him up to serve at the tabernacle as a boy, but as the years passed, she supported his efforts at full-time service. (1 Sam. 2:18,19) The result was that Samuel became “more likable both from Jehovah’s standpoint and from that of men.” (1 Sam. 2:26) How rewarding it must have been for these parents to see their sons receive special privileges of service from Jehovah! Many parents are enjoying that same feeling today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">EACH ONE CAN HAVE A SHARE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What can each of us do, regardless of where we are serving Jehovah? We all need to be whole-souled in our service, putting Kingdom interests first in our lives. (Col. 3:23; Matt. 6:33) And we can also encourage those who are serving at Bethel to continue to render sacred service there. In addition, encourage young brothers who do qualify to reach out for this special privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At times there is a tendency to think of others when matters of this nature are discussed, or to think that this does not involve me. But when we think of what our Father has done for us by means of his Son we should be moved to do whatever we can individually to accomplish God’s will. As the apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:14, 15: “The love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have judged, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died; and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When we think of that, it behooves each one to ask himself: “Am I living no longer for myself but to do Jehovah’s will?” You will be eager to do whatever appears to be God’s will for you at the present time. You may send now for an application for Bethel service if you feel you can qualify for this unique privilege of service. Also, when you are at one of the district conventions this summer we encourage you to attend the Saturday afternoon meeting for those who are interested in Bethel service. At that time you can obtain a Bethel application.—Eph. 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Doing What Is Fine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">became inactive so far as the spiritual building work is concerned and stopped going in field service. Additionally, 27.3 percent or 164,240 of the total publishers were irregular in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A SOURCE OF HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> It would seem that some of the builders in Nehemiah’s time were like that, too. They became fearful as a result of the pressures brought to bear on them. How were they helped to “have a heart for working” as they had displayed initially? (Neh. 4:6) Nehemiah tells us: “When I saw their fear I immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: ‘Do not be afraid on their account. Jehovah the great and the fear-inspiring ' One keep in your mind.’ ”—Neh. 4:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Can we help our inactive and irregular brothers and sisters today to “have a heart for working” in a similar way? Certainly! Elders, ministerial servants and, yes, “the rest of the people,” all of us, can help them to keep in mind this same great and fear-inspiring One. Sometimes all it takes is a word of encouragement, letting them know we love them and miss them. Giving encouragement is everyone’s job. The account says Nehemiah “immediately rose” and did this. Will you do the same? It may save the life of your brother or sister by helping that individual not to give up in doing what is fine.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP YOURSELF</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> If you are one who has slowed down or stopped in your service of God, others can help, but primarily the responsibility rests on you. Our brothers in Nehemiah’s time needed both to do Jehovah’s work of wall building, as well as cope with enemy attacks. We similarly need both to carry on Jehovah’s work of preaching today, and avoid being sidetracked by the many pressures Satan brings to bear on us. Whatever the pressure may be, let us keep the same determination Paul had when he wrote: “So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">if we do not tire out.”—</span><span class="font1">Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> One of the primary ways we demonstrate our personal support of God’s kingdom is by putting forth an effort to aid others to come under its rule. Jesus said, “This good news of the kingdom will be preached,” but what is our attitude toward that work? (Matt. 24:14) How much do you expend yourself to preach the Kingdom good news to others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> The ainount of time you devote to Kingdom preaching and the example you set should show Jehovah and others that you are giving your full, wholehearted support to the Kingdom. With better planning and improved family organization could you do more in field service? Would it be possible to auxiliary pioneer from time to time? Whole-souled service is not following the course of least resistance, coasting along with minimal activity!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> In Jesus’ parable of the sower, it is acknowledged that some are able to do more than others in making expressions regarding the Kingdom. (Matt. 13:8) Some spend many hours in the preaching work each month. Other loyal Kingdom subjects are unable to do as much. Yet even though limited in amount, it is not a “token” service but represents all they can do. They find joy in knowing that our Lord views their hearts too as being “fine soil,” producing fruit that honors Jehovah.—Matt. 13:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> Our attitude toward the preaching work and the time and thought we give to it are positive indications to Jehovah of our love and appreciation for his government. When a person is deeply interested in something—if it involves something close to his heart —he cannot help but speak about it. Similarly, if we consider our future blessings under the Kingdom’s rule as something to be treasured, we will gladly and eagerly join in openly acknowledging our loyal support of the Kingdom on a regular basis.—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IN ALL WE DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> Really, in all we do—at all times—our lives should reflect the fact that we are subjects of Jehovah’s kingdom. So whether we are eating, drinking, enjoying entertainment or a vacation period, our concern will be to conduct ourselves in a way that honors God.—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> How often do you find that you are able to offer sacrifices of praise to Jehovah? Are you able to share in the field service one or two days a week? When writing to Christians in Jerusalem, Paul urged them to “always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (Heb. 13:15) Those early Christians were acquainted with the fact that, under God’s law to Israel, sacrifices had been offered at the temple every day, morning and evening. Not a day went by when no sacrifice was offered up.—Ex. 29:38-42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> But how can we imitate that pattern? Not all of us can get out into the field service every day, to say nothing of twice a day. Yet there are occasions nearly every day when we can offer such sacrifices of praise to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> What if you have a full-time secular job? Well, a brother in New York took a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font1"> to his place of work and put it on his desk, knowing that it would arouse the curiosity of his fellow employees. It did, and they inquired about it. His conversation was brief, since it was during work hours, but he told them three things: ‘The book is accurate; it covers Bible events in chronological order; and it costs only $2.00.’ The rest he let them see for themselves. He got orders for 63 books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Some brothers are in business for themselves, and they may witness more extensively while at work. A barber in New York, while not forcing the truth on his customers, does try to share something with each one; and when interest is shown, haircuts sometimes take a little longer. A taxi driver in Japan finds that if he personally shuts the car door and welcomes his customer, he can establish a</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">friendly relationship. His discussions of God’s Word often last five minutes—sometimes an hour.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Are there opportunities to witness when you go shopping? A sister in Canada was in a large store and she stopped to look at some paintings of beautiful mountains, blue skies, trees and flowers. She commented to another woman: “All these beauties Jehovah God created, and now men have ruined so much.” The woman replied: “It’s true, but what can we do about it?” They had an enjoyable conversation. The woman wanted to know where our sister had learned so much about the Bible. Arrangements were made for a home Bible study. And it all happened while she was shopping.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Young publishers, too, have excellent opportunities. Following an incident of violence in the school that she attends, a young sister in Tennessee realized that it was a good opportunity to share the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font1"> book with others. After discussing with her parents how to proceed, she took one book to the principal and another to her homeroom teacher. With their approval, she offered the book to classmates; they obtained 35 in just one day!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Those who have many good experiences in informal witnessing usually give some thought to it in advance. They are looking for opportunities to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise.” They also pray to Jehovah to open a “door of utterance” to them. (Col. 4:2-4) Have you prayerfully reviewed your daily routine to determine when and where it might be possible for you to do some informal witnessing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> While in house-to-house work, many have had excellent results by following the suggestions appearing in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font1"> to approach persons who may be on the street, coming in and out of buildings or in elevators of large apartment buildings. We do not have to wait until we contact individuals at their doors to speak to them about God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> Realizing that salespersons often come to the house, a sister in California put a small table just inside the door. On it she has a Bible and an attractive display of other publications. That display “makes it happen.” Visitors comment on what they see, and this leads to a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> A brother in Missouri resolved that, during his 15-minute break</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font11">Why should you know which brothers are overseers and ministerial servants in your congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah God has provided qualified men to take the lead among his people. Scripturally, these brothers are designated “overseers and ministerial servants.&quot; (Phil. 1:1) As their designations suggest, overseers and ministerial servants </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">serve</span><span class="font11"> the members of the congregation. (Matt. 20:26) They are both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">qualified</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">available</span><span class="font11"> to serve you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Overseers are elders who are qualified teachers and shepherds. To help care for necessary work properly, there are “ministerial servants.” Together these servants aid us to be “zealous for fine works.” (Titus 2:14) Overseers and ministerial servants should ‘know the flock’ to be of greatest assistance. (Prov. 27:23) In turn, the flock needs to know the men who are qualified and appointed to serve them. (Jas. 5:14-16) Therefore, appointments and deletions of elders and ministerial servants are announced to the congregation.—Compare Acts 15: 25-30; 1 Corinthians 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are various reasons why a brother in the congregation may not be able to serve as an appointed servant. Likewise if appointed, for various reasons a brother may not be able to continue serving the congregation as an elder or as a ministerial servant. No one should conclude automatically that announcements of deletions indicate some wrongdoing. Sometimes health, family matters or other circumstances may preclude a brother’s continued service in an appointed capacity. By knowing which brothers are overseers and which brothers are ministerial servants in your congregation, you are able to benefit yourself in a direct wav from their qualifications and availability to teach, shepherd and aid you to be “zealous for fine works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at work, he would witness to the first person who sat down next to him. The man to whom he spoke knew about the truth but said that he did not want to pursue the matter. Nevertheless, our brother i left literature where the man could i easily pick it up. In six months ‘ that man and his family were all baptized.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> Another brother simply made it a practice to do his Bible reading at lunch time. That “made it : happen.” Soon one of the men started to ask questions about religious matters. He was impressed. As a result, when publishers called at his home, a study was started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>12</sup> Many publishers open the way for informal witnessing by wearing lapel badges while traveling to and from conventions. Will you be wearing your convention badge this summer, and will you have some literature with you as you travel, in the event that you can use it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>13</sup> So we should not limit our sacrifices of praise to a set day and time of the week. When gratitude to Jehovah fills our hearts, it is only natural to let it overflow in upbuilding conversation about him on every appropriate occasion, wherever we are.</span></p></li></ul>

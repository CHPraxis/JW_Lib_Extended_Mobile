<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> For centuries Christians have prayed, “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:9, 10) We eagerly look forward to the many blessed changes God’s kingdom will bring following the “great tribulation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> But even now, since the installing of Jesus as God’s heavenly King in 1914, millions of persons have made changes in their lives to conform with the Kingdom’s direction. As more people take their stand for God’s kingdom by conforming their lives to its laws, God’s will is being accomplished more and more on earth. Happily, the time will soon come when all the opposers of that kingdom are vanquished.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Does your family indicate by its actions and way of life that it recognizes the headship of Christ, our heavenly King? If so, how can one tell? Families may vary considerably in many respects; individual preferences may differ. But if God’s Kingdom rule really does affect your family, there is one common denominator. You will be making every effort to follow the lead that Jesus gave, his way of life, his teachings, his service to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Since Christ’s rule is one of peace, should not peace be reflected in our families? Surely bickering,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Prepare as a Family?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> What are the benefits of a family’s reading the Bible together, or preparing together for meetings and for field service? As one young brother from Delaware put it: “We learned self-discipline, to sit still, and to study for a period of time. More important, we learned the value of personal study. We kept up with the weekly meetings, getting more out of the information than we ever would have on our own.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> This young man later went into full-time service. His zeal and devotion in the field service, as well as that of many other young people like him, reflect favorably upon the parents for their efforts to prepare their children for a life of service to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FINDING THE TIME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> What comes to your mind as a parent when family preparation is mentioned? Do you think: “As faultfinding and displays of temper should be rare, if they exist at all. (Eph. 4:26, 31, 32) Husbands, do the ways that you deal with your wives give evidence that you are subjects of the King, who is “mild-tempered and lowly in heart”? (Matt. 11:28-30) You wives, are your actions toward your husbands and your children an evidence of submission to Christ, who is your husbands’ head? (1 Cor. 11:3; Eph. 5:22, 23) You children, do you honor your parents in a way that shows that you are imitating Christ, who always does the will of his Father? (John 8:29) The answers to these questions indicate the extent to which your family is responding to Kingdom rule.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> It takes time and effort to break away from worldly attitudes and patterns of speech. If even one member of the family makes the effort, there will be a blessing. When the husband sets a fine example, this encourages the wife to respond. And a submissive attitude on the part of the wife may encourage the husband to imitate the example of Christ, the one who is his head. Even the good example of children has helped parents to become subjects of God’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> But how can .this be achieved? Spirituality on the part of family members is needed in order to make such changes. How is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3) </span><span class="font2">valuable as it is, when will I find time for it?” Have you tried to make some time for it? How persistent have your efforts been? Each person’s situation is different. But it would be helpful to see what some are doing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> One family in New York takes advantage of the evening meal together to discuss spiritual matters. In different evenings, they discuss the day’s text together and- talk about points from the weekly Bible reading. At times they prepare for the service meeting or Theocratic School while at the supper table. In addition, they regularly schedule part of an evening each week for a systematic study of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or some other publication. Of course, something has to go, so they limit their TV viewing. The mother, having more time with their son, works with him to pre-</span></p>

Discussion of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century </span><span class="font11">brochure, pages 23, 24, on the “Practical Value of the ‘Good News’ to Your Community.” Invite well-qualified young readers, brothers or sisters, to read paragraphs. Then ask questions for audience to answer. Emphasize that Christianity is practical and that, when witnessing, we can use this material to help others to appreciate the “good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: “How Does God’s Kingdom Affect Your Family?&quot; Base Introductory comments on paragraphs 1-3. Then cover remaining paragraphs thoroughly; be sure to read scriptures and get comments as to what they should mean in our lives.

Emphasize that all who are truly disciples of Jesus Christ need to be conscientious about responding to the rule of God’s kingdom. Please make full use of what is printed in the article in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Presenting the Good News —To Families.” After Introductory comments on paragraph 1, ask audience questions on paragraphs 2 and 3. Demonstrate presentation found in paragraph 4, but interrupt it at appropriate points and invite audience to comment on It, telling what they felt was effective, as well as suggestions for perhaps making the presentation more effective by fitting it to the specific householder. Cover remainder of article with questions. Stress that our objective in using the new book is to make disciples—if possible, involving entire families in Bible discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Service arrangements should be made clear to all. Conclude with song 119 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 4</span></p>

Cover </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century</span><span class="font11"> brochure, pages 25 and 26, “Their Worldwide Organization and Work.” Handled by talk, but involving audience by asking them questions. Tie in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1979 Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> citing how many were baptized and how many Bible studies were conducted, and what the local congregation did to contribute to these figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font11">Continue in brochure, pages 26-31, &quot;Questions Often Asked About Them.” Have </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">various family groups </span><span class="font11">assigned In advance to consider selected questions that would be most appropriate for congregation’s territory.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">23 min: </span><span class="font11">“Do You Prepare as a Family?&quot; Elder discusses with family the value of reading the Bible together as a family, as well as preparing together for meetings and field service.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">min: Song 3 and general announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: To Whom Shall We Go as Families? Present as talk and involve audience with questions outlined below; discuss scriptures as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Constant pressure is on families to turn them from serving Jehovah. Each family member's loyalty is being severely tested. Must have confidence in the direction and lead Jehovah provides through Christ. Discuss John 14:6. No S resent or future hope apart from od’s provision through Jesus.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Early Christians faced similar tests of loyalty. When Jesus presented a difficult Scriptural truth, some turned away, but not Peter. (John 6:67-69) Do we have the same spirit? Why is it important for family members to feel like Peter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What would we gain by turning away? Association with a loveless world, perhaps a few sensual thrills, a return to mind-darkening doctrines, a short aimless life filled with problems, a void to be filled by the demons. —2 Pet. 2:19-22; compare Luke 11: 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What do we have and keep by remaining under the headship of Christ? The benefits of Christ’s ransom, the Bible as a guide to our lives, a solid hope of a paradise earth, hope of resurrection of the dead, privilege of bearing the name of Jehovah, clear vision of the clear-cut difference between Jehovah’s organization and Satan’s, opportunities to share good news with others, a life of purpose and real hope.—John 14:19; 1 Pet. 3:18; Matt. 6:10; Isa. 43:10, 11; John 15:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To remain under Christ’s leadership, we need strong faith. How can each family member build faith to benefit ail in the family? (Rom. 10:17) Disciplemaking under the command of Jesus draws us together and strengthens our faith, as we help others the way we have been helped. (Matt. 28:19, 20) What else is required of our families in order to have Jehovah’s approval? —John 15:4, 10. (Stress unity and obedience.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As families we want to stick close to Jehovah under the headship of Christ and those appointed to look after the flock. Show by daily conduct that we have the same appreciation expressed by Peter.—John 6:67-69.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">“Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations:” To be handled by elder with fine teaching qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brief introductory comments: Last month we discussed Inspired messages to congregations of Ephesus, Smyrna and Pergamum, and their application to congregations today. Emphasize how the messages to the congregations of Thyatlra, Sardis, Philadelphia and La-odicea are beneficial to congregations today, and als® to many families that make up these congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(Invite all to open Bibles to Revelation chapter 2. Audience participation.) Who is the one with “eyes like a fiery flame” that is inspecting the congregations and their overseers? What was commendable about the Thyatlra congregation? (Rev. 2:18, 19) What kind of woman was Jezebel? What things did she teach? What was her attitude? What will happen in our day to those unrepentantly following a similar course? Can Jesus as head of the congregation today know of wrongdoing not apparent to others? (vss. 20-23) What are the “deep things of Satan”? How can we as individuals and families avoid getting to know these “deep things&quot;? (vs. 24; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Finished Mystery’’ </span><span class="font11">book, p. 148) What encouragement is given for us today, in verse 25? In what activity will faithful anointed ones share? What does their receiving “the morning star” mean? (vss. 26-28; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fm,</span><span class="font11"> pp. 149-153)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are we like the congregation In Sardis? How could people today appear to be alive but be dead? (3:1, 2) Of what do both congregations and families need to be mindful? Why? (vs. 3) Since the “outer garments” indicate one’s appearance as a Christian, what is required of us as Christians if we want the reward of everlasting life? (vss. 4-6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are we like the congregation in Philadelphia? Are we responding to the open door of Christian activity? How can we do so as families? (vs. 8) How has the &quot;synagogue of Satan” done obeisance before the feet of the anointed? (vs. 9; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fm,</span><span class="font11"> pp. 172-174) What rewards are promised the faithful anointed ones in Philadelphia? What does this indicate regarding faithful ones today? (vss. 10-13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What was the problem with the congregation in Laodicea? What is the significance of being lukewarm? In what way could this happen to us today? (vss. 14-16) In what sense were the Laodlceans “miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked ? How could families be in that same state today? What remedy is prescribed for recovery? How can Christians make use of that remedy today? (vss. 17, 18) How are we encouraged to respond to Christ's discipline? (vs. 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conclusion: Must be ever conscious that we are under inspection as congregations and families. Salvation does not come merely from claiming to be Jehovah’s Witnesses. Let us each pay attention to what the spirit says to the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Field service announcements and encouragement to apply year’s text in our lives. Song 33 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 48 and general announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font11">What Are We Doing with What We Are Learning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Work needs to be done on this part WELL IN ADVANCE. Many fine field points and points to help us in our everyday lives are covered in our service meeting, the, Theocratic School and the congregation book study each week. Are we using what we are learning? On this part, use 10 minutes for each of these meetings. Early In the month, assign one or two book study groups to cover each of the three meetings, picking different groups than were used the previous month, if possible. Ask them to be alert to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">use</span><span class="font11"> points gleaned from material discussed at these meet-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font11"> I)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">ROOMING: During April the Society will be sending a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation for obtaining hotel, motel and private home accommodations through the assembly organization. These Room Request forms will contain the rooming headquarters address for each assembly and other pertinent information needed for requesting rooms. Please fill out the Room Request form very carefully and give it to the Assembly Coordinator in your congregation. He will then check, sign and send it directly to the assembly city rooming address (NOT to the Society) no earlier than eight weeks ahead of the date of the assembly that you have selected. This will be in ample time for you to receive your rooming assignment prior to the assembly. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">please send word immediately </span><span class="font14">(1) to the name and address on your rooming assignment and (2) to the assembly rooming department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">TO THE BODY OF ELDERS: After receipt of this insert, we suggest that the elders meet briefly before the next service meeting to determine which city and dates your congregation is to attend by locating the circuit or portion thereof that your congregation is in as of the end of February on the above circuit list. Then please read the insert to the congregation at that service meeting and the next </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study, announcing the city and dates recommended by the Society. Emphasize any points that would be helpful to the publishers and interested ones. There is no reason to read the entire chart to the congregation. Your congregation is in one of the circuits listed in the chart and the one reading the insert should read the dates and the assembly that the Society recommends you attend. Also, please underline on the above circuit list the recommended assembly city and dates your congregation is to attend and post the insert on the information board for the benefit of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We look forward to seeing you and your family as well as your interested ones at this faith-strengthening “Living Hope” District Assembly this summer and know it will prove to be a rich spiritual blessing to all of you. Plan now to attend all four days so as to fully enjoy the fine program that has been arranged.</span></p>

Then he goes out with his father or mother, putting into application the things he has learned. Such family cooperation makes the best use of their limited time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Another suggestion is to take a half hour after a meal, before the table is cleared, to cover at least a portion of the Bible reading for the week. All family members can take part, making it interesting and instructive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT SHOULD BE STUDIED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Obviously the needs of the family must be considered. Some may do their Bible reading, others prepare for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study; still others make it a practice to study things that fit the particular needs of their families. One brother in his early twenties commented on the help his father gave him to prepare for field service, saying: “I can remember having a little black notebook with scriptures listed under certain subjects, like ‘Trinity.’ Dad would pretend to be a householder whose objections I would have to overcome. I also had to memorize the names of the books of the Bible, five at a time, between each Monday night study.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Another brother who has been at Bethel for 10 years, and whose </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings . . . Make Disciples </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">Ings. They may use such points In making a personal decision, in Informal witnessing, when going from house to house, on return visits or In any other way. We would like to hear their experiences on this program. This should </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font11"> be a review of the meetings but should highlight how material from the meetings nas </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">actually been used.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Serve Loyally—Do Not Give Up! Elder to discuss following material with audience. Scriptures should be included in the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is loyalty? (Eph. 4:24) If you know that a member of the congregation Is guilty of serious wrongdoing, what should loyalty move you to do? (Lev. 5:1) If you heard a critical report about a brother, what would loyalty move you to do? (Ps. 50:20, 21; 1 Tim. 5:19) If there was an opportunity of making quite a bit of money, but it was at the possible risk of doing harm to our Christian brothers, what course would loyalty move us to take?—Prov. 28:20: 1 Tim. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What situations today could test the loyalty of young Christians? How was young Joseph able to resist the pressures and temptations to commit immorality? What do we learn by the expression “day after day” in connection with this temptation? How could similar situations come up at school? (Gen. 39:7-12) How could Eli’s sons have been a test to young Samuel’s loyalty? Could similar tests be exerted on young ones from within God’s congregation today?—1 Sam. 2:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conclude with encouragement to make loyalty a part of our personality.—Eph. 4:24; 1 Thess. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Service announcements. Song 65 and prayer. </span><span class="font2">brother also served at Bethel, recalls that in his family his father always pointed them toward the prospect of full-time service. “So it was natural that we should want to come to Bethel,” he noted. The family study is still consistently held for the benefit of a younger brother remaining at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> A 26-year-old brother from Minnesota recalls that his mother would study with him, and together they prepared for the meetings and field service. They hid their publications in the dried cereal boxes, knowing that the opposed father never ate dried cereal. Those secret study periods proved their worth as they prepared the son for full-time service both as a regular pioneer and at Bethel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> It is good to be flexible in these family study sessions. Also, it is beneficial to have a relaxed atmosphere, rather than a strict disciplined procedure. As one brother put it: “On our family study night our mother would prepare in advance some ‘treat’ and after we finished our study period we would enjoy this. Some time in the evening would also be used for a family game or for the family to sing together. We looked forward to our family study nights.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INCLUDE OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Many brothers and sisters have no family members in the truth. It would be a kindness to invite such ones, where possible, to share with you in family Bible reading or in family preparation for meetings and field service. (Deut. 15: 7-11; Luke 6:38) Perhaps sometimes the family study can be held at the home of some older publisher who lives alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> Do not minimize the value of reading the Bible together and of preparation for meetings and field service within the family. When parents set a good example, not letting such periods of family Bible discussion be easily infringed upon by other interests, this impresses upon their children the vital importance of deep respect and appreciation for God’s Word. All of this works to Jehovah’s praise and to the blessings of those who prepare as a family.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">। the needed guidelines in the Bible. I These principles are discussed in ' this new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Making Your Fam; ily Life Happy.</span><span class="font2"> Notice the aspects of the subject that are discussed. [Show the table of contents.] The book also points to the lasting solution to mankind’s problems. No doubt you pray for it. You are acquainted with the Lord’s Prayer, aren’t you? [Quote Matthew 6:9, 10.] It is God’s will that his kingdom remove all wickedness from this earth. The final chapter of this book shows how the family life of all persons who now put their faith in God’s kingdom will be benefited. We are leaving this book for only 35 cents.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Wouldn’t it be good if we could make it our goal to speak with as many family groups as possible during the month of February? Have this in mind as you lay the groundwork for your return visit. When the discussion is concluding on your first call, you might say: “Since we are interested in discussing the Bible with families, I would like to return at a time when the rest of your family is at home to continue our discussion. [Ask what time is convenient to call.] In the meantime, you may want to look over the book, and when I return we can discuss the chapter that most appeals to you and your family.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> We are sure you agree that this new book will be very helpful to the families in your territory. Already we have received numerous letters of appreciation for the fine counsel contained in the book. One man exclaimed: “As my wife arid I progress through its pages, our family life continues to improve.” Very likely you had similar feelings as you read the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> So, as you endeavor to make disciples, think in terms of aiding entire families. Help them to see the value of the Kingdom message so that they can share together in the blessings of the future.—Rev. 21:4.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To Families</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Families that apply Bible principles and that build their lives around God’s kingdom have found that their problems are reduced, if not solved, and happiness is achieved. Isn’t this a grand message to bring to the families in your territory during the month of February, using the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Making Your Family Life Happy<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">2</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark14">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark15">4</a></sup>?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> How are we going to do this? By directing their attention to God’s Word, which sets out the principles for happy family life. Family life is on the minds of people. Be willing to talk about it. Show them how the new book can help them. But also point out that the problems of family life will never be completely solved until God’s kingdom removes all wickedness from the earth. That is what people are praying for when they say the Lord’s Prayer, but most of them don’t realize it. (Matt. 6:9, 10) The final chapter of the book on family life can help them to appreciate this truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Of course, when you talk to people about the problems of family life, you will want to be tactful. Avoid giving the impression that you think the householder is having problems in his family. It would be better to refer to the problem as one that society in general is having.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> You might start off in this manner: “I’m calling to share with you some information about a problem that affects much of the world today. It involves family life. All of us want our family to be happy, but we know that many families are not really happy. What do you feel would help people to find greater happiness in their family life? [Let them answer.] Don’t you agree that it would be beneficial to listen to what the Creator of the family says? He sets out </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings for Field Service </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font0">make regarding an interested person? How can these various observations be of real value on the return visit?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Why is it good not to postpone making your various notations regarding an interested person?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. How do you determine the best time to make a return call?</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Affect</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Your Family? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Cont d) </span><span class="font2">spirituality of your family? Could there be improvement? The Kingdom rule provides the finest in practical education from the Scriptures. How may we benefit most fully from it? Really, it is by your family’s making an effort to read and study together, and to prepare for meetings and service. Parents need to encourage their children to pay close attention at meetings and to participate. When a family does these things, the beneficial results can soon be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AS TO FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Just as Christ’s followers were commissioned to preach the good news of the Kingdom, so Christians in our time show they are loyal advocates of the Kingdom by preaching. Do the members of your family make an effort to help one another to serve in the field as disciples of Christ? How many in your family could be publishers? Appreciating the reality of the Kingdom, we want to help all, especially those close to us, to enjoy eternally the privilege of rendering Jehovah sacred service. —Rev. 7:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Consider the example of the family of Philip mentioned in Acts 21:8, 9. Philip is here called “the evangelizer,” which indicates he must have been very active in sharing the good news with others. But Philip was not content to serve God by himself. He must have done much to build up the spirituality of his household and to encourage his family to share in honoring Jehovah, for the account tells us of his four virgin daughters who “prophesied.” So the question is, Are you fathers, like Philip, taking the lead in the service and helping others in your family to enjoy a share in this service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Certainly if we accept Jehovah’s kingdom as a reality, we will want to speak about it to others. What a fine thing when we make it our goal, as a family, to accept the direction of the Kingdom in our lives. Not only does it bring blessings to us now in a happy, united way of life, but it also provides a wonderful and secure hope for the future. As we look forward to the yet future blessings that the rule of Christ will bring for our family, we can pray with confidence: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” And by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we will have the assurance that not only our families but also others whom we help may live to see God’s will accomplished world wide.</span></p></li></ul>

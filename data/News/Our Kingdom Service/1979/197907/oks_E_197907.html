<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We Need to Help One Another!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More Definite Arrangements to Be Made</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> True Christians are noted for the love they show to one another. (John 13:34, 35) They help one another. We know this is essential if we are going to endure successfully the trials and temptations we face in this difficult time of the end and at the same time care for the commission Jehovah has given to us to preach the good news of the Kingdom and gather the remaining sheeplike ones. But we need to intensify our love for one another. We need to improve the help we give to one another. This is evident when we consider current needs within our worldwide association of brothers. Likely you see this need in your own congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In Jehovah’s organization there are zealous and effective praisers of Jehovah. Their faith is strong and they continue to endure despite economic, health or other factors. And they serve loyally, even though the end of this system has not come as soon as they may</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Issue of &quot;The Watchtower'' to Feature 100th Anniversary</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> One hundred years of continuous publication! In view of the great opposition experienced, is that not of itself powerful and convincing evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the endeavors of his modern witnesses to announce the Kingdom message far and wide? The July 1, 1979, issue marks the beginning of the 101st year of publication of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Only 6,000 copies were printed of that first July 1879 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Zion’s Watch Tower,</span><span class="font12"> then printed monthly and only in English. From that small beginning, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> has grown over the years, both in number of copies printed and in spiritual stature. Millions have come to respect its reliability during the century of its publication in providing spiritual “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45) Even through two world wars, despite bans and opposition, it has not missed a single issue. Copies printed of each issue increased to 55,905 by 1929; 185,065 in 1939; 966,280 in 1949; 3,708,647 in 1959 and 6,641,483 in 1969. And in this anniversary year of 1979 no other religious publication comes anywhere near the distribution of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> with over 9,200,000 have expected. But in our midst are new ones who have been added in the past few years. In addition, some who have been active in the preaching work in past years have become irregular or inactive in the service. Some of these have also let their appreciation for spiritual food wane to the point of attending only a few meetings or none at all. Often this is due to the influences of this world causing their love for Jehovah to become lukewarm or even celd.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVING ARRANGEMENTS TO HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What is needed? We need to HELP ONE ANOTHER! True, we have been giving some assistance. But doubtless you will agree, more definite arrangements can be made not only to provide the type of help needed but also to make sure this is given long enough to really benefit those who need it. Such assistance is so vital that we should not leave it to chance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In coming months the theme </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font12"> J)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">copies on the average being printed of each issue in 82 languages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In reading this July 1 special issue you will have a number of reasons for being enthusiastic in presenting it to the public. Articles in this special issue deal with how the world has changed during the past 100 years and how </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> progressively has met the spiritual needs of those hungering for truth. One tells how </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> is printed and distributed. Other articles show how, right from the beginning, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> has been a champion in exposing false teachings such as immortality of the human soul, Trinity, hellfire, and so forth, while highlighting Jehovah’s name and kingdom, and bringing comfort and encouragement through such basic truths as the ransom, resurrection of the dead and the second coming of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The two study articles discuss how we can prove we have the truth and how God guides his people today. They encourage us to remain steadfast in our adherence to the truth and loyal to our God Jehovah and his congregation, showing how we can successfully do this.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Life with a Purpose Is Not Boring. Elder discusses with group of young folks practical points from chapter 9 of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book, &quot;Are You Bored at Home?” (See also w76 9/1 p. 519.) Not only at home, but are you bored at meetings, in field service, at school? Why? What is remedy? The following questions may be used or adapted In conducting the discussion: (1) What natural factors in growing up contribute to being bored at times? (2) How does one’s own attitude determine to a large extent whether one becomes bored or not? (3) What can you do personally to improve the spirit in your home? (4) When you get assignments at home, at school or otherwise, why Is It helpful to see how such assignments may affect your life now and in the future? To relieve boredom, why can it make a difference if you do things for others? (Phil. 2:3, 4) (5) Why does preparing for and commenting at meetings help to make them more interesting? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font11">How will keeping in mind the reasons why we share in the preaching work help you have joy in the service? (7) Why is the complaint, &quot;There’s nothing to do,” not a valid one? (8) Why are endurance and faith important in conquering boredom? Elder concludes with admonition to youth in congregation to fight boredom by being active in Jehovah’s service, including also commendation for what Is being done by young ones to serve Jehovah and keep strong in faith despite the allures of this world and problems “incidental to youth.”—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Theme: Helping One Another Produce Good Fruitage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Song 49 and local announcements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font11">Planting Seed with Hope that Much of It Will Fall on Good Soil. Read and discuss each verse of Jesus’ parable at Matthew 13:18-23, with emphasis on how we want our hearts personally to prove to be good soil, as we also preach the “word of the kingdom” with the hope that many more will hear the word, get the sense of it and produce good fruitage. (See w76 4/1 pp. 220-222; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">or p.</span><span class="font11"> 108, 109.) 1. Read verses 18, 19: What Is the seed sown? Why is it said to be sown in the heart? Who are represented by the one where seed was sown alongside the road?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Read verses 20, 21: Who are represented by the ones where seed was sown upon the rocky places? How do they receive the word, out what causes them to stumble?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Read verse 22: Who are represented by the ones where seed was sown among the thorns? What makes them unfruitful? Why is this a warning even to Christians who are now producing fruitage ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Read verse 23: What is it that makes one’s heart “fine soil”? (Contrast with three previous conditions.) Why is it important not only to hear the word but also to get the sense of it? Define good fruitage that is produced. Why did Jesus show that one would produce a hundredfold, another sixty, and still another thirty? (or p. 109)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Conclude with encouragement to share to the fullest extent of our circumstances in sowing seeds of the Kingdom, hoping that many will fall on good soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14 min: </span><span class="font11">How Can We Use What We Have Learned? Review of practical things learned at the service meetings in July. Suggest that brother handling this part meet In advance with a group of brothers and sisters to talk over specific things that have benefited them; these points can be shared with the congregation. This part should be well thought out so that It will be of real value. They can tell how they have used or plan to use the suggestions given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6 min: Encourage all to support the special day for house-to-house witnessing on Sunday. Song 68 and prayer. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Issue &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you have not already done so, why not set out immediately to read this issue from cover to cover. Select interesting points that you would like to use in speaking with others about it, and thus prepare yourself for a full share in field service during the month of July. If you will be attending one of the “Living Hope” District Conventions during July and August, you will have additional opportunities to speak with others about Jehovah’s kingdom, using this special issue.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> You may have enough copies of the special issue to continue offering it during the entire month of July. If so, you may want to introduce it along with the July 15 issue when it arrives. The July 15 issue features the experience of a sister who was imprisoned in China on and off during 20 years because she resumed preaching the good news of the Kingdom each time she was released. The study articles provide Scriptural encouragement to sustain you in the vital work of searching out deserving ones from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> May we show our appreciation for the abundant blessings that Jehovah has given his people during the past 100 years by continued faithful service and by zealously sharing our hope with others.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">“We Need to Help One Another!” will be stressed on the meetings in various ways. Three particular ways of giving help will be highlighted: (1) By more definite arrangements in the book study groups for experienced publishers to help those who want and need assistance in the disciple-making work. (2) By setting aside the first Sunday of each month for a special effort in the house-to-house work, with encouragement for all in the congregation to participate. (3) By strengthening the shepherding work and improving the quality of teaching in order to build faith and spirituality. Combined with this will be many opportunities for all publishers, brothers and sisters alike, to give encouragement and assistance. All of this is designed to HELP ONE ANOTHER!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANIONS IN SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you are just starting in the preaching work; if you are finding it a little difficult to speak effectively at the doors; or if you are becoming a little discouraged and are slowing down in your service, we believe you will welcome the assistance of an experienced companion in the service. Paul admonished: “And let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another.” Then pointing to the future, he adds: “And all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) That day is very near! We need to be ‘incited to love and fine works’ all the more so now. We believe all of Jehovah’s servants see the need to cooperate in making more definite arrangements for HELPING ONE ANOTHER! (The article on page 3, the first in a series, gives details on how these arrangements can be made.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST SUNDAY FOR SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By having the first Sunday of each month set aside for a special effort in the house-to-house work, everyone can plan accordingly. (Of course, there will be other days for service as before.) You may be a sister with an unbelieving mate. Would he be willing for you to devote two or more hours at least one Sunday a month in service? All members of the family may be willing to cooperate to make this possible. Other publishers may have different circumstances of a pressing nature that prevent them from going but every Sunday, but advance preparation may make it possible to spend at least one Sunday each month in field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping One Another (Part I): </span><span class="font13">In the Field</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In the modern-day history of Jehovah’s people, the preaching of the good news from house to house has obviously had Jehovah’s blessing. It has greatly facilitated the carrying out of the commission given by Jesus to his disciples to “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Jesus set the example in training his disciples. He not only taught them about the Kingdom and other Bible truths, but he also instructed them in the most effective ways of preaching this good news to others. He sent them out by twos. (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1) This undoubtedly provided companionship and encouragement, but we can be sure that they learned from each other, too, as they responded wholeheartedly to the Master’s invitation to go forth and preach that the kingdom of the heavens was at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> And what joy they had working together! Luke 10:17 tells us that “the seventy returned with joy,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BUILDING FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Jesus said to Peter: “Strengthen your brothers”; “feed my lambs.” Later Peter admonished elders: “Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly . . . becoming examples to the flock.” (Luke 22:32; John 21:15; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3) Some elders do well in shepherding, but there is a need for more specialized help, more specific application of Jehovah’s Word in building faith and spirituality. This requires discernment and warm consideration. And when elders and ministerial servants receive parts on the meetings, such are excellent times to strengthen faith. Make local application. Be enthusiastic. Be encouraging. And practice what you preach, by being right out there in the field working with the publishers. Example always means more than words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> As we get help, it is expected that we will become more experienced and effective ourselves. We will become stronger in faith and determination to serve Jehovah. This will put us in an excellent position to help still others. Let us therefore fully support the arrangements made to HELP ONE ANOTHER that we might continue to serve Jehovah faithfully while helping our brother or sister to do the same. Precious lives are involved! saying: ‘Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.’ ” But Jesus corrected their thinking by saying: “Do not rejoice over this, that the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been inscribed in the heavens.” (Luke 10:20) Yes, the reason for preaching is not to draw attention to ourselves by spectacular feats but to save lives, our own and those to whom we preach.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> While the situation in our territory may be somewhat different today, nevertheless, the basic instructions are still applicable as to what we preach as well as the need for searching out deserving ones even in the face of opposition. And today, as in Jesus’ day, new disciples still need loving assistance so as to share effectively in the preaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Are you one who has much experience in preaching the good news and who might assist another who desires help? Or would you like an experienced publisher to work with you for a few weeks to share with you practical ways of improving your disciple-making work? We invite you to speak with your study conductor or the service overseer about your willingness to share, either to give or receive assistance. (More details will be given on how these arrangements can be made in book study groups in the August </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> As you begin to work with your companion in the service, you might first get together to look over what you might use effectively as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> topic for conversation in your territory. Practice sessions are helpful. Typical situations at the door can be simulated. This will give you experience and fix in your mind definite points to talk about. Good preparation does much to reduce doubts about one’s ability to speak and the fear of not knowing what to say. Thus, a strong desire builds up to tell out what you have in your heart, knowing that you are sharing in a life-saving work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Going to the doors together provides opportunity to put right into practice things learned. Experience is gained. Confidence is built up. Joy in Jehovah’s service results. And when interested ones are found, this brings great happiness. Arrangements are made to return and feed these “sheep.” If some are not interested, despite</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In presenting the special July 1 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> the following suggested presentations may be helpful to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> If circumstances are such that only a brief presentation can be made, after introducing yourself and your service partner, you might say: “We’ve stopped by just briefly to bring you a most interesting special issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> For one hundred years now this magazine has been published. And one of the articles in this centennial issue shows how it has come to have the respect of millions of truth-seekers around the world, in that it has had the courage to speak the truth on controversial religious teachings. Regardless of your religious background, I’m sure you would be interested in reading this and the other articles. This special issue is yours along with this copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> for a contribution of just 20c.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you can give a more extended witness, you may be able to use some or all of the thoughts below based on Psalm 146. You might say: “How good to find you at home at this time because we have volunteered some of our time and effort to share some good news with you. Most of the news we get today is bad news, isn’t it so? [Allow person to answer.] Sad to say, much of the bad news today has to do with the failures of governments to provide basic human needs for those who depend on them. Therefore, when we learn about a government that has God’s backing and that will without fail bring in conditions of peace and prosperity for all mankind, wouldn’t you say that is really good news? [Pause for comment.] Did you ever think of God’s kingdom that we pray for in the Lord’s Prayer as a real government that</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">our good efforts, this does not discourage us. Not everyone listened to Jesus, and no one could improve on his methods. (Matt. 13:58) So there is no reason to be disturbed if some turn a deaf ear or even speak harsh words at times. We go along to the next house looking for the “sheep,” not taking anything said in a personal way.</span></p>

We all have a gift or potential for lending a helping hand in some way to assist our fellow praisers of Jehovah. will soon provide a completely righteous rule for humans living right here on earth? [Pause for possible reply.] You probably will appreciate what the inspired psalmist wrote at Psalm 146:5 and 6. [Read.] Also please note that verses 8 and 9 speak of a physical healing for the people and a promise to care for the needs of disadvantaged ones. [Point out key words in these verses.] And then in verse 10, note that all this will be done by Jehovah as King and that his rulership will last forever. Isn’t that encouraging? And isn’t it truly good news?<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup>’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At this point introduce the subscription offer: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">is the foremost magazine published today that announces Jehovah’s kingdom. And do you know that, beginning with this July 1 issue, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> is beginning its second century of publication? That’s right, the first issue was published in July of 1879, and we are taking the opportunity this month to offer to our neighbors a year’s subscription to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> for just $2.00.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> You may vary this presentation by referring to the contents of the special issue or by citing a particular statement of interest. Also some of you may wish to combine a subscription to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> at the same time (for $4.00), giving the new subscriber two pocket-size books free.

<p><span class="font11">• What is the correct way to count meeting attendance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All adults should be counted. And how old should children be In order to be counted? A definite age has not been set. Rather, if the attendant believes that a child is benefiting and learning from the meeting, even to a limited extent, he should be counted. So, while young children may not pay the very best attention all through the meeting, if they nonetheless benefit and learn something, they should be counted. (Neh. 8:2) Parents are truly wise when they teaeh their children to pay attention rather than provide coloring books or other things that hinder children from listening and learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At assemblies, if persons are able to hear the program and are benefiting to some extent from it, they should be counted, even though not seated. Of course, all are encouraged to take seats and enjoy the program to the full, showing proper respect for what is being presented from the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is suggested that the count be taken during the last half of the meeting.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember how you felt when you first grasped the significance of God’s kingdom? It is, indeed, glorious good news! As you have read accounts of Jesus’ life you have observed that the Kingdom is the message that he kept to the fore. Zealously he preached it and he urged his followers to do the same. At Matthew 10:7, he said: “As you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ ” Have 19 centuries of time diminished the power and force of God’s kingdom? Not at all!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MESSAGE HAS NOT CHANGED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Over the centuries, governments of all kinds have come and gone. The inadequacy of human governments has been eloquently underscored, but one thing remains firm, real and brimming with hope, namely, God’s kingdom backed by the irresistible power of the Sovereign Lord of the Universe. How grateful we can be to have the privilege of sharing that hope with all who will listen!—Rom. 15:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We are now more than 64 years into the “time of the end.” How should this affect us? For one thing, more than ever before, we can see that the Kingdom is the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are We Allowing God's Spirit to Operate Freely?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> To Christians in Rome, Paul wrote: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah. Rejoice in the hope.” (Rom. 12:11, 12) How does one become “aglow with the spirit”? Is it just a matter of asking God? It is true that God must give the spirit before one can “be aglow” with it, and Luke 11:13 speaks of God as giving “holy spirit to those asking him.” But it is not automatic, is it? It is somewhat like getting electric power from the power company or water from the water company. The supply is there, usually in abundance, but they will provide it only for those who meet certain qualifications. So it is with God’s holy spirit. There is no shortage, but we must qualify for it by cultivating a right heart condition and by learning and conforming to God’s requirements. (Acts 15:8; 5:32) Diligence in meeting these qualifications is needed if we are truly going to be “aglow with the spirit.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">HOW</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> GOD’S SPIRIT OPERATES FREELY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As a person can draw on electric power by putting a plug into</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Is the Solution</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">only solution to man’s ills. And we know that only those who put their full confidence in it will survive the “great tribulation.” Thus, it is more urgent than ever before that people have the opportunity to hear about God’s kingdom and be encouraged to take their stand on its side.—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNOUNCING JEHOVAH’S KINGDOM,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Of course, when talking with people we want to be adaptable and converse with them on topics that interest them. But no matter what we might use to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">catch</span><span class="font10"> their interest, the real solution is God’s kingdom and this is the thought we want to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">leave</span><span class="font10"> with them. Now, how might we do this to the best advantage?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Many of us may elect to start our conversation by inquiring how the householder feels about the high cost of living, family problems, unemployment, crime and violence, and so forth. Likely, we will get a ready response that these are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">difficult</span><span class="font10"> times for many. Or, suppose we choose to ask: “Do you think the time will come when we will not need locks, alarm systems, security forces, and so forth, to</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">an outlet and he can get water by turning on a faucet, so we open the way for God’s spirit to operate in our lives when we take some action. For example, we benefit from the operation of holy spirit (1) when we personally study God’s inspired Word (2 Tim. 3:16; Josh. 1:8), (2) when we attend meetings where that Word is discussed (Heb. 10: 24, 25; 1 Cor. 14:24, 25), (3) when we give a witness to others about the good things contained in the Bible (Acts 1:8; John 14:26), (4) when our actions toward our Christian brothers and sisters demonstrate love, which is a fruit of God’s spirit (1 John 3:14, 16-18; Gal. 5:22), (5) when we respond appreciatively to the oversight of elders who have been appointed by holy spirit (Acts 20:28; Eph. 4:8, 11-16), and (6) when we turn to God in prayer and ask for his help (Luke 11:13). On the other hand, at Ephesians 4:30 we are told: “Do not be grieving God’s holy spirit.” So we need to avoid conduct that is out of harmony with God’s spirit, which is a holy, or clean, force.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Talk About the Kingdom</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> God’s kingdom is the only solution to the world’s problems. Yet literally millions upon millions of people do not know this, even though many of them at one time or another have heard that kingdom mentioned. What can we do to help them appreciate the significance of God’s kingdom in their lives?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps one of the more simple approaches we can make to people is to help them to reason on something that many of them already know. What is that? The Lord’s Prayer. In Matthew 6:9, 10, we find the model prayer Jesus gave, asking for God’s will to be done on earth as in heaven. Just how might we present the matter? Maybe something along the following lines will be appealing. After a short introduction of yourself to the householder, say:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “I’m sure you are interested in the security of your family and home, especially in today’s world where there are so many things that undermine that security. Most people look to some means of protection. They may have extra locks on their doors, or alarms, or a dog to sound a warning when strangers approach. [Get .householder’s reaction.] The Bible promises the best possible means of security for all mankind. You may have asked God in prayer many times for this means of security without knowing it. [Read Matthew 6:9, 10.] Have</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• • M°J&lt;e Disciples, , </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont d) </span><span class="font9">points gleaned from material discussed at the meetings. They may use it in making a personal decision, in informal witnessing or when going from house to house or on return visits. We would like to hear their experiences on this program. This should not be a review of the meetings but should highlight how material from the meetings has actually been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman should select points from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> material, book study material and public talk material that COULD be used but perhaps was not, and work this into the three 10-mlnute parts as time permits. Ask friends: &quot;How COULD we have used this point in field service, In making decisions, in helping our children, in informal witnessing, and so forth?” Tell congregation that we are going to do this again next month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Song 64 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION </span><span class="font0">God's Kingdom Is the Solution, u .n </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">t r\ y r\ </span><span class="font10">you ever thought of the Lord’s Prayer as holding the answer to the need for real security for mankind? Really, the kingdom of God is the solution to the problems mankind faces.” From that point on, depending on the reception you have received, you can proceed with the conversation, or make an offer of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription or other publications to the householder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A briefer approach could be along the following lines. After you introduce yourself, say: “We are calling because of a common concern we share as to one of mankind’s most pressing needs—for peace and security. The solution is found in the familiar words of the Lord’s Prayer at Matthew 6:9, 10. [Read.] I’m sure that this Godgiven solution is of interest to you.” From there proceed with the conversation or the offer you may wish to make to the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is good to remember that in advocating God’s kingdom as the solution to mankind’s problems, your conviction and sincerity will go a long way toward helping the honest-hearted ones you meet to take seriously what you say. If their hearts are drawn toward God, it can be your happy privilege to assist them to take the necessary steps to become disciples of Jesus Christ, our King. Why not try using this scripture during the coming months as you seek to help others know that God’s kingdom is the solution.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">• Please note that starting January 1, 1979, congregations will be charged $1.90 for each one-year subscription submitted at publisher rate. This is the rate shown in the Cost List and on the Weekly Subscriptions form (M-203).</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">• In the future, the secretary of the congregation will be responsible for keeping the meeting attendance records for the congregation, instead of the Bible study overseer.

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God's Kingdom Is the Solution </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont d) </span><span class="font10">protect our life and property from lawless people?” Regardless of the response to either of these inquiries (or similar ones), we always want to point to the real remedy, God’s kingdom. How can we do this? By asking at an opportune time in our conversation: “What do you</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">think the solution to this problem is?” Or, “Is God going to do anything about this? What do you think?” These questions can help to steer the conversation in the right direction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> By i^entS^rng ^oJ^s^ingdom as the real solution, we focus attention not merely on social problems, but on the permanent solution to these problems. While it is fitting to start out with something that puts us on a common level with the householder, we should always try to finish with the real solution, God’s kingdom. If we were to discuss at great length some social issue and what we and others might do to improve the situation, we would be missing the mark; we would be talking about temporary relief when we know the permanent cure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> So, as we offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">subscription during January (with a free 384- or 416-page book or the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font10"> book), we should stress the real solution for all of man’s ills, as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> itself does. Appropriately, the new topic for conversation centers around Matthew 6:9, 10, but you may use another text if your territory seems to require it. Try it, using the suggestions in Presenting the Good News. “God’s Kingdom Is the Solution” will be our topic for conversation for the next four months. Our being upbuilding and positive in the way we discuss God’s kingdom will no doubt appeal to the hearts of many householders who long for a real solution to problems that face us all.</span></p></li></ul>

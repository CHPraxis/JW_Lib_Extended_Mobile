<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> ‘I like my privacy and have never encouraged visitors to drop in unannounced/ wrote one successful businesswoman, who added: ‘One evening about 7:30, there was a knock on my door. It was a widow who lives on my floor. She was lonely and asked if she could come in and visit for a while. I politely but bluntly told her I was busy. She apologized and left. I felt quite proud of myself for not getting trapped by such a bore. The next evening a friend telephoned and asked if I knew the woman in my building who had committed suicide the night before. If you have not already pressed, she was the woman who knocked on my door!’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> How tragic! The attitude of this woman, whose letter was published in many newspapers, is typical of those in a world where love has grown as cold as ice. Very few want to burden themselves by reaching out and showing love to others. Yet what a vivid contrast this should be with us! We want to help others. What an opportunity we have to prove that our love has not grown cold toward people by distributing the tract “What Has Happened to Love?” People need to know that there are still pet-sons with genuine love.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Millions of people feel lost, afraid and miserable. Young peo</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Help One Another to Serve Regularly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Regular field activity is a sign of spiritual strength. However, when one is ill plans get frustrated, things no longer get done and help is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah is a superb example of being regular in all his activities. He provides for our spiritual and material needs regularly. (Rev. 22: 2; Matt. 6:11) Our very existence depends on the regularity found in his creation, and even though we are undeserving, he does not forget us but is constant in his love toward us.—Jas. 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> We certainly appreciate the benefits from such regular service from Jehovah, do we not? Such appreciation will move us to respond in like manner by making room in our busy lives to serve him regularly, not letting a month go by without in some way sharing in preaching the good news and in reporting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>?</sub></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> There is need, too, for us to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">help one another</span><span class="font3"> to be regular in the service, for reports show that ple often feel bitter, unwanted, not knowing what to do with their lives. Frustrated, unhappy married persons turn to divorce for relief. Loneliness has become a prison for many. This is all very sad and our hearts go out to so many peo-Ele who do not know how to find appiness. (Matt. 9:36) But, happily, we can do something to help by showing these people what is missing in their lives: love for Jehovah, and love for neighbor.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> As you go from house to house during September, try to talk with people from the Bible, perhaps discussing with them one of the Scripture references on page 3 of the tract. Endeavor to start a Bible study on the initial call. If circumstances are not right to start a study then, offer the brochure and two magazines for 25c. However, use your good judgment for we want the householders to know we are there because we love them and want to help them—not just to place literature. If no one is at home, leave the tract out of sight. (It is illegal to put items in the mailbox.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font3"> April 1976, Announcements, page 2.) A territory can be reported as worked when we cover it with tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Aside from a full share in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">last year some 37,000 in the U.S., or about five per congregation on the average, allowed their field service to become first irregular and finally inactive. If there are any in your congregation, do you know who they are? But, more importantly, what can be done to help them? First of all, elders can take the lead in calling on them, possibly taking along some ministerial servants who could effectively follow up with loving assistance. Individually, though, we also have a responsibility toward such ones who are “related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) So, we encourage you to offer to call on some of them after checking with elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Often, what is needed is simply for us to take a personal interest in them and offer to take them with us in field service, perhaps accompanying us in making return visits or on a Bible study. This in itself may serve to rekindle their joy and the love they once had for the field service. For some, it may </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Building to Jehovah’s Glory. —1 Chron. 29:9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Talk covering highlights of article &quot;Building to Jehovah’s Glory” in May 1, 1979, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Emphasize that all things should be used to honor Jehovah since they belong to him. (1 Chron. 29:11) Under subheading &quot;Building for the Future,” briefly review history of expansion of organization world wide. In considering &quot;Building with a Purpose,” highlight reason for expansion of facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Discussion with audience on part we individually can play in building to Jehovah’s glory. Cover following points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Honor Jehovah with our valuable things, such as time, energy, material things, and so forth. —Prov. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. As in David’s day, support by individuals shows appreciation of Jehovah’s blessing.—1 Chron. 29:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Voluntary contributions from the heart are encouraged.—2 Cor. 8:12; 9:7.</span></p></li></ul>

Emphasize need to keep personally strong by serving regularly; also to assist others who need some help. In considering paragraph 5. include demonstration of experienced publisher calling on one who has not recently associated. Start with discussion of 2 Peter 1:5-8 and share points learned from talk &quot;Neither Inactive nor Unfruitful,” Saturday afternoon of &quot;Living Hope” District Convention. Select a few of the qualities mentioned in verses and bring in appropriate points remembered from talk. For example, on FAITH: Loss of faith can begin with &quot;clean” association with nice neighbors, workmates, and so forth, or by being so wrapped up in daily concerns for life that one thinks about God less and less. Each day must give thought to fact that God exists and not let busy schedule crowd out prayers and Bible reading. On SELF-CONTROL: May need self-control in things not wrong in themselves—when to turn off TV or leave friend’s house. Getting more rest may help enjoy service and meetings more. For God’s spirit to help us, must learn to say “No&quot; when faced with temptation. It is love of God and neighbor that motivates us to action and fruitfulness, but need to deepen love so it not only exists, but &quot;overflows,” making works not forced, but spontaneous from heart. After discussion, tactfully invite and arrange to go to Kingdom Hall together on Sunday. Chairman concludes part by considering 1 Corinthians 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">(4 min.) Chairman briefly reviews benefits of arrangement for giving assistance. To aid those who have mutually agreed to work together for awhile, the following demonstrations may be of help: (1) preparing together, and (2) working together in the field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Expressions from publishers who have benefited from working with others in the past. Song 59 and prayer.</span></p>

Cover also main points in second study article showing dangers set before youth by demoncontrolled system. Discuss why and how they can be avoided. Encourage youth to stick close to Jehovah’s organization and enjoy blessings of Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Youths Serve with Joy in the Field. Discussion with group of young publishers who are good examples. Chairman can open by commending youths for what they are and what they can do in praising Jehovah. Discuss opportunities to share in house-to-house work and draw out comments. During discussion some could express feelings they might have, such as: (1) Not always easy to talk with older people. (2) Same is true when classmates answer the door. (3) Feel they are not qualified to answer questions from householder. Chairman discusses points with youths and draws out comments on these helpful suggestions: Need to develop proper mental attitude (2 Tim. 2:22); determine points a youth could develop with an adult; how young publishers could approach youths who answer the doOr; advantages of working with older publishers at times as well as with other youths; how older youths can help younger ones prepare for field service. Conclude by encouraging youths and older ones to share joyfully in telling out the good news.—Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">&quot;How Are You Using What You Learned This Month?” Brother assigned this part will discuss with publishers in advance how they have benefited from the following: (1) Assisting inactive ones to see why we should be regular in service. (2) Helping one another to speak effectively at the doors. (3) Reporting field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Song 109 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help ... to Serve Regularly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’cT) </span><span class="font3">be helpful to strengthen their appreciation for spiritual things. This can be done by our sharing with them some particularly appealing material in the publications, or some interesting Scriptural points learned at the circuit or district assemblies, or some encouraging experiences heard at the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere. This may encourage them to attend meetings regularly, and, in turn, they can be assisted to share in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> When we put forth the effort to serve regularly ourselves, “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” our faith will be “steadfast” and “unmovable.” We will then be able to help others who may have become irregular or inactive. We can be assured that our “labor is not in vain in connection with the 'Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said: “Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” (Luke 6:40) The majority of his disciples were just ordinary people like us. By going with Jesus, listening to him and watching his methods of teaching, they were soon ready to be sent out by twos to preach the good news to their neighbors. They took to heart the command to “make disciples . . . baptizing them . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> As disciples of Jesus today, we are under obligation to preach the good news and “make disciples.” That Jehovah’s blessing is obviously upon our preaching at the doors of our neighbors, as it was in the first century, is shown each month by the number baptized. These persons in turn take up the disciplemaking work, and thus, the number preaching has increased.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Many of us today, as in Jesus’ day, need assistance in order to become disciple-makers. In various congregations provisions exist to aid us to be better teachers. The last two issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font3"> discussed arrangements for experienced publishers to lend a helping hand. When you volunteer to assist another or another offers to assist you to speak at the doors, what can be done?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Beginning with September, a new series of circuit assemblies will begin throughout the United States. But before we discuss what is ahead, let us pause and reflect on the circuit assembly program just concluded. Did you get to attend that spiritual feast? We certainly hope so. Most brothers did and many wrote to the Society to express their appreciation for the fine program that served to strengthen us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Most who wrote the Society commented on the direct way in which the program helped us all to recognize the dangers of Satan’s unclean world so as to maintain a clean congregation.

In preparing together as companions in service, spend some time discussing suggested presentations from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font3"> Discuss what can be used as introductory remarks, how to get into the presentation, into the Bible, into the literature offer, as well as concluding the call and starting a study where possible. After getting the points in mind, take turns being the publisher and then the householder. These practice sessions will do much to help you to speak with confidence at the door. As Jesus had the truth, so we have it, too, and it is what other people need to gain life under Kingdom rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> On your way to the territory, by reviewing with each other the points you want to use, you will have them fresh in mind when you get to the first door and you will be off to a good start. You can decide if the one with more experience takes the first door or two. Or, after the introduction, both might share in reading scriptures and commenting. As you work together, discuss how your presentations might be improved. Be encouraging and supportive to each other as companions in the service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> But now what does the future hold? Well, beginning this month the new program starts, with its theme, “Proving Ourselves Fruitful Disciples.” One part of the program will deal with building with fire-resistant materials and how this can help us produce fruitage. Are we building fire-resistant qualities into new disciples? What are these fire-resistant qualities? Are we really reaching hearts by the art of teaching? And what are some of the fiery tests that affect Christians today?</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> In the world of mankind, young and old admit often and freely that there is a great need for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">love. </span><span class="font3">Haven’t you found that to be so in . your field activity? How sad it is that people are not aware of how or where to find the love they need! And what a marvelous opportunity Jehovah is giving us to show millions, by our combined efforts world wide, ‘What Has Happened to Love’! Who could not be excited about participating in this effort?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Although you may feel free to use any presentation that appeals to you and that is suitable to your personality and makeup, here are some suggestions. Those with experience might say: “This morning (afternoon) I’m visiting my neighbors to discuss a vital need in our community. Note the question that is the title of this tract. [Give householder tract as you read title.] If more love were shown in our community it would be a far more enjoyable place to live, wouldn’t it? [Allow for comment.] How enjoyable life would be if these circumstances were eliminated! [Point to illustration on page </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.]</span><span class="font3"> Note the words of our Lord Jesus, quoted from Matthew 24:12, here on page 3. He stated that part of the sign of our living in the last days would be that ‘the love of the greater number would cool off.’ Is it possible that we are seeing this in our lifetime?” (Allow for comment.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> If circumstances allow you to continue, open your Bible to 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and discuss appropriate points with the householder. Start a Bible study where possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Likely you will have many opportunities to place the brochure and two magazines. You might say: “Many people have asked questions about Jehovah’s Witnesses, wanting to know something about their beliefs and activities, which include my coming to your home today.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> For you who are newer in field service, you may wish to say: “I recently became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses because of looking for an improved quality of life, a fellowship where love exists world wide regardless of race or nationality. Please allow me to give you this printed message as a gift. [Give tract.] While you may have your own religion, you will find some scriptures in here that I am sure you will enjoy reading.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> If you are young in years, you might find it easy to say: “I’m being trained by my parents to show concern for other people. One of the ways I can do this is to visit my neighbors with an encouraging message from the Bible. Here is your free copy.” (Give tract.) Where interest is shown and your parents (or others) are at the door with you, they may wish to assist you to develop the interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> What can we do to stimulate interest where a tract was left at a not-at-home? Return where possible. You could say: “I was by your home [state about when] to leave you a copy of this free tract. In the event you did not receive it, I brought you another.” (Hand to householder and proceed with one of the above presentations.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Distribution of tracts has introduced the truth to thousands of people, many of whom will be sharing this tract with others. By sharing as fully as our circumstances permit, thousands more will be helped to learn of Jehovah’s great love for mankind.</span></p></li></ul>

Have you considered how one could become involved with “Babylon’s” bad fruitage in one’s secular work? What are some ways our Christian brothers and sisters have avoided “Babylon’s” unclean things at their places of employment? And, just what is the basis for all of us to progress in bearing Christian fruitage? We are sure you will enjoy hearing how these and other timely questions will be answered on the new circuit assembly program. Truly it is a faith-strengthening program. Be sure to include it on your schedule of upcoming theocratic activities.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Question (Sox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• What benefit is there in reporting our field service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A “good report” is said to have the same uplifting and refreshing effect as cold water on a tired soul. (Prov. 25: 25) For example, how encouraging it was for us to read in the July </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> that we had an all-time peak of 51,008 auxiliary pioneers in April and that over one million more hours were spent in field service that month than a year ago! Such thrilling reports certainly bring us great joy and refreshment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An accurate and complete report from us also enables the Society to plan its activities properly, especially in estimating and anticipating the amount of literature we need in our Kingdomwitnessing and disciple-making work. Also, such reports are used to identify places where there may be a greater need, so that assistance can be directed to such areas to further spread the Kingdom good news.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But, what is it that makes possible such encouraging and helpful reports? It is basically the conscientious effort of each Kingdom publisher in turning in reports regularly each month that enables the branch office to compile and publish composite reports for the encouragement of all. So, while it may be a small thing in itself, our reporting regularly can be viewed as one of the things we can personally do to build up and encourage our brothers world wide. Is that not worthy of our concern and effort? Hence, report regularly yourself and also help others to do so. Book study conductors and the service overseer particularly can take the lead in doing this. Such helpful reminders should be given and accepted In the spirit of love. May we have concern for one another with a view to making a good report.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">learning practical things you can apply at the door. You will see the need to be friendly, natural and conversational; how you can use questions to stimulate interest and to determine how the householder is thinking; how to be adaptable; the need to listen to the householder. You will see how the presentation can easily lead into placing the offer and starting a Bible study where possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> You will also learn how to handle indifference, even opposition, at the door. Many will not listen, but we do not get upset. We are looking for sheeplike ones. (John 10:4) Calmly we go to the next door, realizing our work is also a dividing work. We learn confidently to go ahead in Jehovah’s strength, knowing it is his work and that he will bless our efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Many of us desire assistance so that we can speak effectively to people at the doors. On the other hand, many of us have the experience to give needed assistance. As Paul counseled: “Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.”—Rom. 15:2.</span></p></li></ul>

Remember, our schoolmates, workmates, neighbors, friends and relatives may miss receiving a tract at their doors, so offer them one. It is clear that if we are to have results, we need to be prepared and alert to our opportunities. Have in mind what you want to say and use the tracts effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Young and old, new and experienced, yes, all of us want to show that we will reach out to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">help others.</span><span class="font3"> We will also do what we can to help the incapacitated ones to share in this work. (8/79 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">km)</span><span class="font3"> As the world grows even colder in its love, let us grow warmer and more intense in our love. As we fulfill our desire to help one another we will have happiness and satisfaction, inciting others to serve Jehovah. May our work with the tract have Jehovah’s rich blessing.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Take Up the Complete Suit of Armor&quot;—Now!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>Tme Christians do not share in carnal warfare. However, they are engaged in a battle and are likened to soldiers. The apostle Paul outlined clearly that the fight of the Christian is not against blood and flesh, but against “the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12) Protective spiritual armor is required in order to survive this conflict. This armor must be acquired and worn NOW, while the battle is on, and not be thought of merely as something needed for the future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Let us consider some of the basic equipment needed in order to wage successful warfare now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> HELMET: A basic part of the defensive armor; headgear designed to protect a soldier during battle. Spiritually, our mind must be protected from improper influences and ungodly propaganda. It must be fed proper, upbuilding information from the Bible by personal, family and congregational study. How much this impresses upon us the need to attend and actively participate in the congregational meetings! Also, how vital the family arrangement is for Bible con-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents—What Are Your Children Learning?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> To learn means “to gain knowledge or understanding ... by study, instruction.” Parents can and should actively promote and participate in the spiritual development of their children, for this is Biblical. (Deut. 6:6, 7) With this purpose in view, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> has proved to be a valuable tool.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The capacity a child has for learning is great. A difficult language is usually learned easily, with little conscious effort being put forth on the part of the child. The mind of a young child is like a clean slate, which can be written upon with ease. Much more is being accomplished by the study of this book than just memorizing stories. Consider the moral lesson in the case of a small child as told in a letter from his family: “Our baby Samuel is 18 months old and can’t say much yet. But he understands the meaning behind the beautiful large pictures. He knows, for example, not to hit kitty with a stick because Jehovah didn’t like Cain anymore after he did that to Abel.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One way thinking ability can be developed is by asking ques-siderations and discussions in the home! Individually, we must meditate upon the truth and our hope of salvation. Do you do this? The positive “hope of salvation” that God has imparted can be powerful enough to protect our mental powers just, as a helmet protects the head.—1 Thess. 5:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> BREASTPLATE: An armored breast protection for warriors, consisting of chains, scales or solid metal. The “breastplate of righteousness” is part of the spiritual armor of God. The need for righteousness as a protective breastplate can readily be appreciated when we consider the sinful bent of the heart. (Gen. 8:21; Jer. 17:9) Only the righteousness that is based on faith in God’s arrangement for everlasting life and that is brought about by his spirit can prevent the heart from yielding to sinful inclinations. (Rom. 6:15-20) Are you endeavoring to grow in love for God’s righteousness and to practice it in your dealings with others each day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> GIRDLE: A leather belt worn around the waist and hips. It varied </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font11">tions, particularly using the question, Why? For example, Why did Adam and Eve sin against God and eat the fruit? Why was that bad? Why should they have listened to God? If your mother tells you not to eat cookies or cake that she has prepared for supper, why should you obey her? If an elder asks all the brothers to sit down because it is time for a meeting to start, why should you do it? If schoolmates want you to disobey your parents or what the Bible says, why should you resist them? Questions of this nature help a child to develop thinking ability and to prepare him for the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Teaching in the family in ancient Israel was primarily the responsibility of the father, with the mother assisting. (Prov. 1:8) What were some of the things the Hebrews taught their children? Fear of Jehovah. (Ps. 34:11) To honor their father and mother. (Ex. 20:12) To respect older persons. (Lev. 19:32) Obedience. (Prov. 4: 1) Practical training for adult living. (Eccl. 12:13, 14) Education in reading and writing.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 84 and local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">&quot;Take Up the Complete Suit of Armor—Now!&quot; Introduce part by reading Ephesians 6:10-17. Have all keep Bibles open to these texts. Have each paragraph read and ask appropriate questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Presenting the Good News -—With the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.<sup>1</sup>’</span><span class="font10"> Assign publishers ahead of time to look up and comment on specific references m article outlining how they can be used.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“How I Got the Truth.” Experiences. Elder interviews two or three individuals or families. It is preferred that those interviewed do not read or memorize what they are going to say. Elder can skillfully ask questions and draw out information, such as when individual first heard of truth, how contacted, what previously believed, problems encountered, and so forth. Help the brothers to know and appreciate one another more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Song 6 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 22 and local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Jesus’ Instructions for Field Service Activity. Service overseer considers selected verses of Matthew 10 and applies to field service activity in local territory. Have verses read by audience and discuss material drawing out brothers with questions. Vss. 5, 6: territory assignment. Vs. 7: theme of preaching. Vss. 11-14: search out deserving ones; have prayerful concern for them; greet householder; do not waste time arguing with opposers; do not allow opposers to rob you of your peace and joy. Vs. 16: attitude and conduct as respects the world. Vss. 17-20: opposition and persecution expected; be confident and trust in Jehovah.

Encourage all to have faith in Jehovah's direction, and find joy in field service activity for the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Elders may develop this part locally or have talk on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">watchtower </span><span class="font10">article “Bible Translations—Does It Matter Which One?” from August 15, 1979, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">“Parents—What Are Your Children Learning?” Talk on article for 10 minutes. Then invite three or four children to platform with their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> book. Have them consider pictures and meaning of what took place in Stories 2, 3 and 4. By means of questions contrast Stories 2 and 3 with Story 4 to show the bad results of disobedience. Make sure points are clear. By questions get their understanding on matters and the moral lessons the Bible contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 30 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Introduction, song 72, local announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: “You </span><span class="font10">Must Show Consideration for Older Persons.” Questions and answers. Have audience read scriptures and apply. Should be handled in warm, upbuilding way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Imitate Their Faith.” (Heb. 13:7) Interview. Invite several older persons to the platform, or may use those who have served faithfully for many years. Questions and comments should be thoroughly reviewed in advance highlighting blessings of faithfulness and Jehovah’s goodness. By using specific questions, chairman will bring out richness and flavor of personal experiences to stimulate and encourage congregation. Warmly commend older ones for their fine example. Reassure that whatever they can do is well-pleasing to Jehovah even though personal circumstances may greatly limit activity. Draw on principle at Mark 12:41-44, encouraging all to imitate their fine example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Encourage Holiday Witnessing. Service overseer will handle this part announcing arrangements for field service during this period. Consider special problems arising at this time of year in your territory and what may be done to handle these effectively. Have brothers prepared to comment on how they handle householders’ remarks such as “I’m busy,” &quot;I’m going shopping,” “I’m preparing a meal,&quot; Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,” and so forth. Emphasize need for tact and discernment. Show how witness can be given when householder is busy by briefly offering two magazines or a book and then leaving with a promise to call back and discuss the literature at a more convenient time. Some find success in raising a single question that one scripture can answer. If the householder is interested, the answer can be shared with him then. Otherwise a return visit can be arranged. Have two</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Children Learning? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">same basic principles must be taught to our children. It brings real pleasure to our hearts to see these young ones learn of Jehovah and acquire thinking ability, and just imagine how it must please Jehovah. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories </span><span class="font11">is a wonderful aid for parents in teaching their children. So, from time to time on our service meeting program, we will include a discussion of portions of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> with a few children. Specific stories will be considered. The one assigned this material with the children will pose simple questions in order to draw out their comments, such as, What is the story about? What do we learn from the picture? Why should we either follow that example or not follow it? Have them explain the meaning of what they are learning. This is similar to what was presented in the drama about young Samuel a few years ago. His father had taught him the ‘10 Words’ (Ten Commandments). However, he was not just to memorize them, but was to be able to explain </span><span class="font10">brief demonstrations of the above suggestions. Stress need for Christian reasonableness and discernment. (See 12/77 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">km,</span><span class="font10"> p. 4, for additional information.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 mln: </span><span class="font10">Song 38 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 116. Appropriate items from Announcements; also local announcements. Consider Theocratic School Schedule for 1980. In reviewing schedule emphasize manner in which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on James</span><span class="font10"> is to be considered. (Assign to school overseer.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font10">Elders may develop this part locally or have talk on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">article “Jehovah Blesses Those Who Exert Themselves Vigorously&quot; from August 1, 1979, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Review major items considered in the December </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font10"> using some of the following questions and others that may be appropriate to your congregation: (1) Have Ephesians 6:10-17 read and ask: “How have you applied this counsel in your life?&quot; (2) Parents, in what practical ways have you been using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> book to instruct your children? (3) Children, how has the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> book helped you? (4) What viewpoint should older ones in the congregation have regarding their service to Jehovah, even when this may be severely limited by the physical problems that come with advancing years? (Luke 21:1-4) (5) Mention things you have done or could do to encourage or assist older ones in the congregation. (6) What presentation have you enjoyed using to offer the Bible and book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Question Box. Elder discusses the points with audience.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 77 and prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">them, thus revealing understanding. Whether conducting this portion with children on the platform or studying with them at home, help them to acquire understanding and display thinking ability.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Parents will want to study the material with their children beforehand, and yet not prepare them with rehearsed answers. Encourage ALL children in the congregation to bring their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> book to the meeting when this portion is considered. Our children make up a large and valuable part of the Christian congregation, and we know that all will enjoy and benefit from their participation in the program. They too are included in the expression: “Every breathing thing—let it praise Jah.” —Ps. 150:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">You Must Show Consideration for Older Persons</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “I really enjoy my association with older ones in our congregation. Their strong faith and depth of love for Jehovah are so upbuilding and encouraging to me.” Expressions like these are heard in congregations where our faithful older brothers and sisters are serving. How happy we are to show consideration for these dear ones!—Lev. 19:32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Although suffering from various health problems, many older brothers serve as elders and ministerial servants. What a fine example they are to us! When the limitations of age prevent them from doing as much as they would like to do now, there is no need for them to step aside, feeling they are no longer serving the congregation. On the contrary, older ones are of great benefit to the entire congregation. We are blessed by their steadfast and faithful example over the years as well as their counsel and mature judgment. We can all heartily agree that “gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.”—Prov. 16: 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Older women also have a fine influence upon the congregation. At Titus 2:2-10 Paul spoke not only of older men, but also of older women and what they could do to “adorn” the truth. The fine examples of older men and women who share regularly in field service each month in spite of the infirmities of age are an inspiration to many who, even without handicaps, do not equal their zeal and devotion. Some of our older ones are limited as to how many hours at a time may be spent in house-to-house work or in street witnessing. Yet, when we see their determination, are we not encouraged to imitate their strong faith and ,the spirit they show? (Phil. 4:23) And, what about their fine example in being on time for the meetings each week even though in some cases this may be difficult. Too, which one of us does not listen carefully to their thoughtful comments reflecting the wisdom and modesty they have accumulated during many years of faithful service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But how can we personally follow the counsel at Leviticus 19:32 to “show consideration for the person of an old man”? Earlier in this verse we read: “Before gray hair you should rise up,” indicating that younger persons should demonstrate a respectful attitude toward older ones. Paul counseled that we should consider others superior to us. (Phil. 2:3) If that is true among all in the Christian congregation, how much more so when the one involved has actually demonstrated love for Jehovah and his Christian brothers by works of faith and deeds of godly devotion over many years. Truly they have earned our respect.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Occasionally a report is received that an older brother or sister who is confined to bed may feel neglected due to lack of regular encouraging visits. While we may not have known them personally or been closely associated with them in the past, yet this does not alter our spiritual relationship with them. It is really a basic Christian responsibility to care for such ones, particularly when they are members of our families. (1 Tim. 5: 8) Lovingly caring for older members of the congregation and particularly our family members is a basic Christian principle that cannot be disregarded by those who love Jehovah. (Mark 7:10; 1 John 3:17, 18; 4:7, 8) All of us should demonstrate our loving concern for their physical and spiritual welfare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> When working our territory, there are a number of ways that we can show consideration for older brothers and sisters. For example, it may be possible to arrange groups so as to minimize the necessity of elderly ones climbing many stairs or hills when going from door to door. Whenever possible, assistance may also be provided to aid older brothers and sisters to make return visits or to get to and from Bible studies where public transportation is inconvenient or considerable distance is involved. Can arrangements also be made to transport them to and from the Kingdom Hall for the meetings or even to assist them to shop for the necessities of life? We can be certain that our love as expressed through our care and concern will be deeply appreciated by our older brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> If we are thoughtful, we will find that there are many ways to show love to one another. Such unselfish giving brings joy and happiness to the entire congregation. John encouraged: “Let us love, neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” (1 John 3:18) Yes, young and old alike benefit from an interchange of encouragement as each one gives of himself in accord with his abilities and circumstances.—Acts 20: 35; Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The apostle Paul recognized “that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of . . . the ones called according to his purpose.” (Rom. 8:28) How happy we are to benefit so richly</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Every reasonable person wants to live. However, today many people do very little to prolong life. Overindulgences and excesses seem to be the order of the day. Violence and civil disorders are spreading to parts of the earth formerly noted for peace and for law-abiding citizens. Reports continue to be published that respect for life seems to be at an all-time low.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> However, we know that if a person follows God’s Word, the Bible, his life will be affected for good. Jehovah will lengthen his days and add years to his life. —Prov. 3:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We have a valuable aid in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> and what a privilege is ours to offer it together with a book for a contribution of $2.50. We should be ready with talking points that might appeal to those searching for the way to life. In the following paragraphs are some suggestions you may wish to use in presenting the Bible and book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If you feel the householder is a religiously inclined person, after introducing yourself you may wish to say: “Many persons are interested in bettering their way of life and so follow some religion. But they are still unhappy. Part of this unhappiness stems from their failure to find fellowship with others in a real international Christian brotherhood. Well, such an international brotherhood is going to be a reality earth wide. Note the*’ words here at 2 Peter 3:13. [Read.]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Take Up . . . Armor&quot; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd) </span><span class="font11">in width from two to six inches and was often studded with plates of iron, silver or gold. Girding up the loins indicated readiness for action. (1 Ki. 18:46) Paul admonished: “Stand firm, therefore, with your loins girded about with truth.” The truth strengthens the embattled Christian in his determination to remain firm when subjected to trialsome situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> SHIELD: Paul recommended the “large shield of faith” as an instrument to “quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles.” Similarly, our faith in Jehovah God, our total reliance on him, enables us to bear up under all kinds of tribulations. This faith is not a mere belief in the existence of the Creator. (Heb. 11:6) It includes unbreakable confidence that The Bible will help you learn more about God’s promises. May I leave this clear, English translation with you together with this book, both for $2.50?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> There is another way you may highlight the value of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> in aiding ,the reader to get a quicker, clearer understanding of scriptures. For example, after introducing yourself you might say: “Some reports say that more and more husbands and wives are disagreeing. Some are even getting divorces after having been married for some time. However, the Bible has valuable counsel on how one could avoid disagreements and divorce. To illustrate, notice how helpful this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font11">is in its concordance section. Here under the word ‘Husband (s)’ some fine scripture references are found. See what it says about a husband and a wife?” (Read phrases from the following: Eph. 5:25 and 1 Pet. 3:1.) “Other fine subjects are found in this concordance of more than 100 pages. May I leave the Bible and this book for $2.50?” Of course, other words from the concordance may be selected depending on what you feel works best. You may use the word “Earth” and tie in 2 Peter 3:13, highlighting God’s promise for something new.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In whatever way we offer the Bible, our goal is to have each honest-hearted one who can, take the Bible and read it together with the book. An enthusiastic presentation of this fine publication will certainly help us reach honest-hearted ones with the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">our heavenly Father will undo any hurt that we may experience, even death itself. (Matt. 10:28) Do you have this faith?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> SWORD: In the Scriptures the sword is the most frequently mentioned weapon of offense and defense. Many were double-edged —cutting from both sides—and were kept sharp and in excellent repair. The Word of God is said to be “sharper than any two-edged sword.” Christian spiritual armor includes “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.” (Eph. 6:17) It can be used offensively to proclaim the truth. Defensively it can ward off false teachings and traditions of men. During the month of December put forth a real effort to use the Bible in your field service activity. Share fully in handling the “sword” aright in direct-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">© In the June, 1977, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kinadom Service,</span><span class="font10"> the question was asked: &quot;What Is the proper view of commercial activities within the congregation?” Are the answers given under Question Box still the proper view?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, what was there stated still applies. Probably the expression &quot;commercial activities” has not been clearly understood by some. The fact that advertisements or other literature from individual Jehovah’s Witnesses or organizations with which they are affiliated may indicate that certain benefits may accrue to members of the congregation, does not take such activities outside the realm of &quot;commercial activities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Kingdom Hall should not be used as an ‘agency’ to advertise any ‘business.’ Let us use it for the purpose it is intended to serve, namely, the worship of Jehovah.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> SANDALS: Footgear is also needed. The foot soldier relies upon his feet for transportation and mobility. Rapid, dependable movement is a prerequisite. As a part of the spiritual readiness, the Christian soldier has feet “shod with the equipment of the good news.” How delightful it is when our feet carry us to the homes of others with a view to helping them. Even while undergoing hardships, our active participation and regular share in making known the “good news” to others can help us to endure faithfully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Are you ‘completely equipped, ready for every good work’? Is all equipment in place and secure? Will you come off victorious in the most crucial battle? Do you see the need to have all the armor now? It is a serious matter. All of God’s people must be conscious of the need to “stand firm” in these difficult days. To do so, the spiritual armor provided by Jehovah is needed. There is a place for each individual piece of equipment. Be sure you are fully equipped. Stand firm in determination to be steadfast in your faith. Come off victorious in your fight against wicked spirits each day and in the final battle impending!</span></p></li></ul>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">What Can You Do with the Help of Holy Spirit?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me,” declared the apostle Paul. Do you have that same confidence? Do you reach out for that power through God’s holy spirit? It is there for the asking.—Phil. 4:13; Luke 11:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Just consider what our brothers in the past have done with the help of Jehovah’s spirit. Noah built a huge ark. Solomon built a temple without equal. Samson slew a thousand men single-handed and pulled down a pagan temple. But perhaps even more significant to us is the fact that Jehovah’s spirit sustained his prophets, ordinary people like us, in preaching work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY PIONEER—CAN YOU?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Thousands today have also said, in effect, ‘With the help of holy spirit I can pioneer.’ And they are doing it! On an average, 115,000 around the world are special, regular or auxiliary pioneers each month. Even in lands where the work is under ban, there are thousands who are in the pioneer service. As some brothers have said, ‘If God’s spirit can raise dead people to life, it surely can animate live ones to make them strong for pioneering.’</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan Ahead—Pioneer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s great invisible military force is ready and poised for action against Satan and his wicked system. What is expected of us just prior to this time when Jehovah sends out the rod of Christ’s strength to subdue the nations? Psalm 110:3 tells us: “Your people will offer themselves </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font11"> on the day of your military force.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Tens of thousands of God’s people, displaying that willing spirit, frequently share in the auxiliary pioneer service. Would you like to be one of the large army who will be doing so during April? To succeed, you will need to plan ahead.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLANNING NECESSARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> After prayerfully considering the prospect, one of the first things to do is to work out a schedule that will make it possible for you to devote 60 hours to the field service during the month. Without neglecting other Christian obligations, you might plan to use two hours each day in the field. Some prefer to devote perhaps five hours to the field service for three days each week, with the remainder of the week to care for family respon-</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What some of our brothers can do with the help of this spirit from God amazes us. Consider one 73-year-old brother here in the United States who has been a regular pioneer for 10 years. About a year ago he had to have both legs amputated. Until then he had been spending about 130 hours each month in field service. This average dropped somewhat during the three months following his operation. But then he began spending over 110 hours each month in the service—without legs! He wrote: “Although I have some problems, I am happy doing the Lord’s work again. Now, I feel as if I am of some use. In about three months I should get my artificial legs and will use them in the Lord’s service.” Who would deny that God’s holy spirit sustains such ones and imparts power to them? Why not take advantage of this “helper” to help </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font11"> to pioneer? —John 14:26.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> One sister who decided to pioneer wrote to the Society: “It was </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font11">sibilities. If you have a secular job and would like to be an auxiliary pioneer, you could schedule evening witnessing along with full weekends of field service. Determine what best fits your circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> One sister says that at the start of each year she looks at the calendar and determines which months have the most holidays in them. She auxiliary pioneers during those months, effectively using the extra days. A traveling overseer in the United States reports that some publishers look for months that have five full weekends in them and then plan to pioneer during those months. For example, the months of September and December of 1979 have five full weekends. Youths in school can make wise use of spring vacation that usually is scheduled for March or April. If you find that you can meet the hour requirement, and if a willing spirit moves you to offer yourself in this way, now is the time to turn in your application.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When making your plans, consider not only reaching the goal of hours, but also how you will </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font10">min: Song 28. General announcements. (Special public talk will be held world wide the week of April 1. The subject is “Happy Though Hungry —How Can It Be? ) Relate experiences in offering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Family Lite</span><span class="font10"> book during February. Any Bible studies started?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">22 min: “What Can You Do with the Help of Holy Spirit?” Audience parti-clpation. Encourage youths to comment on paragraph 2. Emphasize main point: With the help of Jehovah’s spirit, many more may be able to pioneer. Will you be one of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Who Has Done It? Ask all who have ever shared in any branch of full-time service, including auxiliary pioneering, to raise their hands. Interview these right from seats (not all need to be asked every question): When did you serve? How do you feel you benefited spiritually from the experience? Did it strengthen your faith and relationship with Jehovah? How? Did it improve your knowledge of the Bible and how to use It in service? Were you better able to cope with objections? Did preaching every day help lessen anxiety about approaching doors and increase your joy in the service? Did you start any Bible studies during your full-time service? Did any come into the truth as a result? Any experiences you wish to relate, especially where evidence of Jehovah’s spirit is illustrated? Would you recommend fulltime service to others? Would you do it again if you could? Encourage those who wish to pioneer to obtain applications from congregation secretary tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Local service announcements, including subject to be discussed during week's meetings for service. Song 117 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 32 and general announcements. Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: &quot;Plan Ahead—Pioneer.&quot; Question-and-answer discussion. Encourage as many as possible in congregation to auxiliary pioneer during April. Obtain application forms from congregation secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Youths, Could Your Life Be Rewarding Like that of Timothy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 mln.) Talk by brother who has pioneer spirit. Consider importance of having wholesome goals in life. What are your goals? Higher education? Having fun in life? A good job? Someone who had all of these things was Solomon. What did Jehovah cause him to write for our benefit? Much worldly education does not bring happiness. (Eccl. 1:18) Pursuing pleasure, making “fun&quot; the big thing in life, leaves one feeling empty. (Eccl. 2:1, 2) Learning to be a good worker is a blessing (Eccl. 2:24), but making your job the main thing in life leads to severe dlsappoint-ment. (Eccl. 2:21) So. what will you do? Do not forget why you are alive. It is to serve Jehovah. Anyone who fails to live in full harmony with that fact will not be really happy. Apply the counsel at Ecclesiastes 12:1, so that in later years you do not say that you “have no delight&quot; In life. Timothy was one who applied that Bible counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(18 min.) Chairman Invites several youths In middle and late teens to platform for discussion centered on life of Timothy. Main point to stress is that a full life, with real blessings, comes to those who use their lives fully in Jehovah's service. Consider the fol-lowlng questions with those on platform: How old may Timothy have been when Paul first visited him while on his second missionary tour? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Aid</span><span class="font10"> p. 1602 ’ll) What personal problem did Timothy evidently have to contend with? (1 Tim. 5:23) How long did he remain with Paul? (W77 6/1 p. 339 119) What experiences did they share together? (2 Tim. 3:10, 11; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font10"> p. 1602 113-5) What wholesome qualities did Timothy demonstrate? (Phil. 2:20-22; 2 Tim. 1:5; w77 6/1 p. 339 f[9) What opportunities did Timothy’s service lead to that other youths of his day did not have? How might the same be true today? (Participants must prepare well In advance for discussion and review source material. Keep part fast-moving and appeal to thinking of youths.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 mln.) Conclusion to audience. By wholeheartedly serving Jehovah fulltime, youths can enjoy full, satisfying life. Nothing is more rewarding than being able to assist someone to get on the road to life. Many of those in fulltime service, like Timothy, who now are overseers, serve in various congregations. Put Jehovah first in your life and experience the many blessings that will result.—Eccl. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font10">min: Local announcements for field service. Announce subject to be considered at meeting for field service next week. Song 109 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 68. General announcements. Special public talk for the week of April 1 will be &quot;Happy Though Hungry—How Can It Be? Encourage publishers to start talking to newly interested ones about attending the Memorial on Wednesday evening, April 11. Briefly cover “Pioneers and Their Reports.&quot; Encourage auxiliary pioneering in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: &quot;Make Sure of the More Important Things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you have a chalkboard in the Kingdom Hall, make use of it for this part. List key scriptures on the board as you discuss them. Alongside, put the gist of the text, such as: “Rev. 4:11 —Alive because of God's will.” “2 Cor. 5:14, 15—Live no longer for self.” &quot;Matt. 16:24—Disown self.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Talk. The Bible shows that there would be a clear distinction between true servants of Jehovah and those who do not serve him. True servants of God recognize that they exist because of God’s will, and the doing of that will is the foremost thing in their lives. (Rev. 4:11) The love that Christ has, as shown in his dying for mankind, moves such persons to live no longer for self. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) Our having disowned ourselves, acknowledging Jehovah as our Owner, should be evident, not only by our baptism, but by how we live our lives every day. (Matt. 16:24) Can we say that these things are really true in our case? If so. God’s Word governs what we do with our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(15 mln.) Audience participation. Read or paraphrase all scriptures. The Bible helps us to keep the truly important things first in our Ilves. (Phil. 1:9-11) What is the result of doing this, as shown in verse 11? And what things lead to that result, according to verse 9?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What does the Bible show to be among the more important things to God? (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) In line with this, how did Jesus use his time when he was on earth? (Mark 1:381 After his resurrection, Jesus drew attention to the authority given him by God, and then to those who recognized that authority he assigned a work. What was it? (Matt. 28:19, 20) Later, before he ascended to heaven, what was the last thing that he said to his disciples so that they would not forget It? (Acts 1:8) The question we individually need to ask ourself Is, 'Does this work occupy the place that it deserves In my life?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some are able to be regular or auxiliary pioneers. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1979 Yearbook </span><span class="font10">shows that, on an average each month last year, 115,389 did so. How many locally? Some earnestly wish that their health and circumstances would make it possible, but these may not. God does not require what our circumstances do not permit; but doing God’s will should be foremost in the life of each of us. Are there any of us who could make adjustments in our lives to share more fully in direct Kingdom service? We do not want to turn out like the one described at Matthew 13: 22; be like the one in verse 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ask audience: Even if some of us have to work at full-time secular jobs, what might indicate that disciplemaking really occupies the place that it should in our lives? How can a mother who spends almost all day caring for her family show that her life is really built around serving Jehovah ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Circumstances In one's life may change: young folks graduate from school: parents have more time when their children set up their own household; retirement leaves one with more free time. Such is a time to ask oneself, Am I really making sure of the more important things? How am I spending my life? What Is Jehovah’s view of the matter? May hls view always guide our steps. (Ps. 36:9) In conclusion, briefly review the key texts used in the introductory talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: “Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good.” (Based on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article in August 15, 1978, issue, page 20 down to second subheading on page 22.) Cover page 20 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font10"> introductory talk (2 min.), showing how we “taste,” as stated at Psalm 34:8, and how understanding the circumstances of David gives added meaning to that verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In covering page 21 and down to second subheading on page 22. read all the paragraphs under any one subheading (a different reader for each section), and then ask appropriate questions. Emphasize the final paragraph in each section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In conclusion, encourage all to consider prayerfully what has been said at this meeting. As dedicated servants of God, are there changes that we should be making in our Ilves in order to share more fully In Jehovah's service? Jehovah promises good things to those who, moved by faith, make such adjustments. (Applications for pioneer service may be obtained from the congregation secretary.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Local arrangements for field service. Mention subject that will be discussed at meetings for field service next week. Song 43 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 105. General announcements and discussion on “Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Further discussion of article from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> of August 15, 1978; from second subheading on page 22 to end of page 23.

<p><span class="font10">Remind those who plan to auxiliary pioneer during April to turn In their applications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">One Is Our Leader—Are You Following His Lead? Scriptural discussion based on Matthew 23:10. Use following questions and scriptures to draw out examples of how each one personally has benefited from the lead of Christ in the areas considered. (Scriptures may be paraphrased or key points read.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How did Jesus set the lead for us in witnessing? (John 18:37; Rev. 1:5) In attitude toward the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">work</span><span class="font10"> of witnessing? (John 4:34) In witnessing when it makes unusual demands on us ? (Mark 6:31-34; Luke 9:10, 11) In witnessing even when meeting many who are not Interested ?—Matt. 23:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How has Jesus’ lead helped you to deal with serious problems you have faced as a witness for Jehovah? (Heb. 5:7, 8) To put up with opposition or indifference from family members? (Mark 3:21; Matt. 13:57, 58) To deal with others in a Christian manner? —Matt. 11:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All appreciate fine example Christ set for us. But he also backed up his lead to the point of 'surrendering his soul for the sheep.’ (John 10:11. 15) This event will be called to mind at the Memorial on April 11. Can show loyal support for our Leader, Ransomer and King by being there and inviting others. Ask audience: How would you invite those with whom you study, relatives, neighbors, workmates, schoolmates and others to Memorial? Mention that Presenting the Good News has suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: What Are We Doing with What We Are Learning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Work needs to be done on this part WELL IN ADVANCE. Many fine field points and others to help us in our everyday lives are covered in our meetings. Our objective should be to use what we learn. (Jas. 1:22-25) On this part, use 5 minutes for each of the following meetings: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study, service meeting, congregation book study. Early in the month assign one or two book study groups to each of the three meetings; ask them to be alert to use points gleaned from material discussed at the meetings. (Rotate the assignments so that study groups are not concentrating on the same meeting that they had last month.) They may apply It in their own lives, use it in informal witnessing or when going from house to house or on a return visit. We would like to hear their experiences. This should </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font10">be a review of the meetings but should highlight how material from the meetings </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">has actually been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Local arrangements for field service. Announce details regarding literature offer for April. (See Announcements.) Special public talk will be given on April 1 (or during that week) on subject &quot;Happy Though Hungry—How Can It Be?&quot; This talk Is being given in congregations in many parts of the world next week. Don't miss it, and endeavor to bring others with you. Song 46 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Program to be planned locally to fit congregation needs. Include 15-minute discussion of April literature offer. Talk about how and when to offer subscriptions. Special magazines have been prepared for April; give them wide distribution. Encourage all to take note of what April Issue of Our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Service</span><span class="font10"> says about a special program of Bible reading before Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan Ahead—Pioneer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">use that time in the field. You will find that your service will be more joyful ana productive if you devote some time—perhaps as much as half of your service time—to making return visits and conducting Bible studies. Do you currently conduct a Bible study with an interested person? If not, make it your goal to start one during the month that you pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Here are a few other things that could be beneficial to do when making your plans: Talk to other members of your family and enlist their cooperation. Why not see if there is another publisher in the congregation that you can encourage to auxiliary pioneer along with you. Find out when meetings for field service will be held. Obtain territory in advance and order extra magazines and literature. Making these necessary arrangements shows that you are complying with the direction given at Proverbs 20; 18, where it says: “By counsel plans themselves are firmly established,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVANTS CAN ASSIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ What can elders and ministerial servants do to assist? Proverbs 15:22 says: “There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk [or, consultation], but in the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment.” Thus it is important to coordinate efforts. Extra meetings for field service may be needed. Have arrangements been made to see that these meetings will have proper oversight and direction? Could an elder or a ministerial servant take the lead in overseeing these meetings for field service? When this is possible, it is greatly appreciated. Has sufficient territory been set aside? Remember that our objective is to make disciples. So, in addition to territory that may currently need working, would it perhaps be possible to provide territory that may be more productive and where interest is more apt to be found?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> All appointed servants can be “aglow” with the spirit whether they can pioneer or not. Enthusiastically encourage auxiliary pioneering, knowing that it is God’s will that we have plenty to do in the work of the Lord and that our “labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With Memorial Invitations</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial celebration brings to our minds what Christ has done in behalf of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> of us, both those of the anointed remnant and the “other sheep.” Though Christ’s command, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me,” was specifically addressed to those who were to reign with him in the heavens as kings and priests, all of us have benefited from the sacrifice that he offered that very day. And this is still open to thousands, perhaps millions more who have yet to exercise faith.—Luke 22:19; John 3:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Therefore all who truly appreciate Christ’s ransom sacrifice, as well as God’s arrangement for Kingdom rule by those taken into the “new covenant,” will want to be present as observers in memorial of this important occasion. Those who attend have the spirit of John the Baptizer, who, knowing that his position was similar to that of an observer at a wedding ceremony, rejoiced with the bride (the anointed) and the bridegroom (Jesus).—John 3:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How can we bring these points home to those we invite to join with us for the Memorial observance? Of course, the printed Me-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What Can You Do ... ? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">my desire to become a regular pioneer, but I was wary, due to my obligations as a wife and as a mother of three children, aged 11, 6 and 4. However, after attending the ‘Victorious Faith’ Convention in Pontiac, Mich., I knew that, if Jehovah willed, I </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">could</span><span class="font11"> do it! I was especially encouraged and strengthened by Thursday’s talks on pioneering. Right then, I decided to put Jehovah to the test. He has answered my prayers. Last night I received my appointment as a regular pioneer.” This sister felt her circumstances would permit her to pioneer; that may not be true of all mothers. But during just the last month of these “Victorious Faith” conventions, the U.S. branch received over 740 applications for the regular pioneer service, more than for any month during the preceding three years! Many of these were married couples who want to pioneer together. Others were teen-agers, widows, retired folks, housewives and people from all walks of life. Holy spirit is helping them to do what many once thought impossible. They are pioneering!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Of course, some have Scriptural morial invitations will be helpful, but we will want to make a warm personal appeal along with the invitation. Perhaps one could say something like this: “I very much want to give you this personal invitation to our yearly celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal. To be there shows that one appreciates what Christ has done for us. Notice here at 2 Corinthians 5:14 how the Bible indicates that we should show our appreciation: [Read to . died for all.”] The Lord’s Evening Meal is the only occasion that Christ himself commanded for special observance. At the meeting there will be an explanation from the Bible of the meaning of this event and its significance in our lives today. We hope you will arrange to be with us on Wednesday evening, April 11. The time and the address of our Kingdom Hall are on the invitation I gave you.” Other scriptures that could be used are Acts 4:12 and John 14:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> No doubt our love for God and his Son will ‘compel us’ to invite all possible to assemble on this most important occasion. Especially should we encourage those who have already shown some interest in the truth to be present and, if possible, offer to call for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">obligations that make it impossible to be regular pioneers. Even so, many of these find a way to auxiliary pioneer from time to time. Their hearts are in the pioneer work. They have the pioneer spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YOU CAN ENCOURAGE PIONEERING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Many of the elders are among those who reflect this spirit. Some of them are able to auxiliary pioneer, and even where this is not possible, they give enthusiastic support to those who can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Unfortunately, not all publishers seem to have this spirit. Some have been heard to discourage those who are in a position to pioneer from doing so. However, they may not appreciate the benefits that result to those who “taste and see that Jehovah is good.” (Ps. 34:8) Many who have set aside pursuits that brought them material advantages in order to pioneer have been richly blessed. Seeking the Kingdom first in expression of their faith has increased their spiritual treasures. And, as the Scriptures promise, Jehovah has added the material things they needed.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> We are commanded to preach the Kingdom good news. For many to share in this work more fully</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Pioneers and Their Reports</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">A variety of questions involving pio-_ieer service are received by the office in Brooklyn. We thought you would be interested in a few of them and the gist of the answers that we give. For example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Should auxiliary pioneers be counted as such if their application was approved by the elders but then they were not able to devote 60 hours to the field service? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• May coffee and lunch breaks be counted as field service time? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The “Organization” book</span><span class="font10"> (p. 126) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">says that the time to be counted on our reports is what we spend actually in Kingdompreaching and disciple^making, witnessing to persons who are not themselves baptized Witnesses. Are you witnessing to someone while you have your coffee or eat lunch? Then count such time. If not, it might be better to start counting time again when you make your first call after lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• If a pioneer Is ill or is involved in an accident, or serious family problems come along, and the individual wants to be given consideration so as to remain on the pioneer list without having to make up the time, who should write to the Society about the matter? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The total elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few other points that could save the office much time are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Married sisters should show “Mrs.&quot; and then their husband's first name on their monthly report cards (e.g., Mrs. John Witness). It someone else makes out the card for the pioneer, It would be appreciated if the pioneer would check to be sure that the name is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• When single pioneer sisters marry, they should supply the Society with the husband’s first and last name and the date of the marriage. Thereafter they should list their name as requested In the preceding point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">?</span><span class="font10"> Pioneers should inform the Society they move from one congregation to another or if they are going to be away from their home congregation for more than three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• When anyone finds it necessary to stop pioneering for some reason, he should notify the elders in the congregation. They should then notify the Society, using the S-206 form. A brief explanation should be given as to why the individual has stopped pioneering and the form should be signed by the local service committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DISTRICT ASSEMBLY CHANGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The 1979 district assemblies listed as “tentative” in the February 1, 1979, issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and February </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> are now definite, with the exception that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font11"> assemblies and circuits listed to attend East Rutherford, N.J., have been changed to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font11">assembly at East Rutherford, N.J., on July 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">it could mean pioneering. What a fine way to carry out the words of our yeartext: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.” (John 15:8) Thus glorifying Jehovah we can be confident of his backing and the help of his holy spirit.</span></p>

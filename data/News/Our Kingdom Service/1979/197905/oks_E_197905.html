<p><span class="font2">with Joy</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Go your way; your son lives.” Can you imagine the joy Jesus felt in speaking these comforting words to a king’s attendant, whose son had been near death! And the child did live! (John 4:46-53) Repeatedly Jesus delivered good news like this. (Matt. 8:13; 15:28) The apostles also made news when they said: “In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!” And the lame man walked! Surely their hearts warmed with joy as they brought good news to others!—Acts 3:1-10; 5:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SIMILAR GOOD NEWS TODAY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Can we really deliver good news like this today? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Indeed we can!</span><span class="font12"> We can tell people, ‘Your redeemed son will live,’ or, ‘You will walk again, yes, leap and run just as a stag does!’ No, this will not occur as soon as you say it, as it did when Jesus and his apostles spoke, but it will really happen under the rule of God’s kingdom. And when it occurs it will be even more wonderful, because then there will be no need for healed ones to get sick again or ever die. We can open God’s Word and present evidence that no one will get sick and die. —Rev. 21:3, 4.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Can You Have a Part in Disciple-Making?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As those familiar with farm operations well know, each spring a farmer plows, harrows and plants his fields. Thereafter he must cultivate, water and weed the crop. Thus he follows through so as to reap the fullest harvest possible. Likewise, a Kingdom publisher who shares fully in the door-to-door work must make further attempts to cultivate the interest shown by various ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It is true that some people, as it were, ‘come into the truth by themselves.’ But, most interest has to be cultivated and nourished carefully. Yet some say that they are not capable of developing interest and starting and conducting studies. Does this mean that such publishers cannot have a part in disciple-making?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL CAN SHARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> To “upward of five hundred brothers,” who had apparently gathered at a post-resurrection appearance in Galilee, Jesus said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Is not this message about the Kingdom the best news you could give to anyone? Yes, indeed. You could not offer a person anything more valuable—bars of gold or bags of diamonds are not as precious as “the good news.” Surely, the privilege of spreading this message about God’s purposes should bring us joy! Why, then, is joy at times lacking among some who bear the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEMIES OF OUR JOY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Principally, the lack of joy is because of the opposition and indifference to the good news. Most persons simply do not want to hear it; they may scoff and ridicule. But remember, the apostle Paul said that “the good news ... is veiled among those who are perishing.” Veiled by whom? By Satan. Yes, he has blinded peoples’ minds so that “the glorious good news . . . might not shine through.” (2 Cor. 4:3, 4) Keeping this fact in mind can help us maintain our joy. How so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> A faithful brother at Brooklyn Bethel, who spent many years in the circuit work, says that, as he speaks with people, he continually </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 2) </span><span class="font12">things I have commanded you.” (1 Cor. 15:6; Matt. 28:10, 19, 20) Since those 500 or so brothers evidently included men, women and possibly even children, does this not indicate that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all can share</span><span class="font12"> in disciple-making today? One older sister from Pennsylvania, who does not speak English well and cannot read the language at all, nevertheless has a share in getting Bible studies started. How does she do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> She has a goal in mind when she engages in the house-to-house work. Her goal is not just to place literature, although she does place much of it. She manifests real concern for the welfare of the people with whom she speaks. Householders appreciate her obvious sincerity and kindness. She promises to return, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">and she does.</span><span class="font12"> But she brings along a publisher who is experienced in conducting Bible studies. A Bible study may then be arranged. Some of these persons have come into the truth. Although this older sister does not conduct stud-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font12"> 7)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 80. Appropriate announcements from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> and general announcements. Remind brothers that they will be asked during last meeting of month to tell what they have been doing with the things they have learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Discussion of Psalm 146 with the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with the psalm that is the basis of our suggested presentation for May through August. To be handled by a well-qualified teacher. Have verses read by different ones in audience, asking such questions as the following after each reading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vs. 1: As Jehovah’s Witnesses, what do we want to do? How does our sharing in field service help to accomplish this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vs. 2: In our efforts to make known God’s government, what should be our determination?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vss. 3, 4: What are we advised not to do? Why? How could we use these verses to snow that confidence in human governments is not practical?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vss. 5, 6: What is the basis of true happiness? Why is Jehovah the one in whom we should trust? How could we use these verses to show that confidence in a government by God is practical?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vss. 7-9: What will Jehovah do for the downtrodden and unfortunate? Whom does Jehovah love? Who will not prosper? How will our using this information encourage people to have confidence in a government by God ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vs. 10: For how long is Jehovah to rule? Why does this give us confidence in God’s government? So, what should we do? In conclusion stress that Jehovah’s kingdom, his government, is mankind’s true hope. We have confidence in it and want to help others to have such confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">“Presenting the Good News —With Our Topic for Conversation.’’ Chairman to base opening remarks on paragraph 1, drawing attention to our previous Topic for Conversation and the appropriateness of following it up with our new one. Then have qualified publisher demonstrate presentation in paragraphs 2-4 with householder who is willing to listen. Chairman should interrupt at appropriate points and ask audience why they feel this is a good way to introduce a point or to draw householder out, and so forth. Analyze whole presentation point by point with audience. Then have a second presentation by a new or youthful publisher who gives a simplified presentation using only Psalm 146:3 and the suggestions in paragraph 5. Consider paragraphs 6-8 by means of audience participation, emphasizing that our ultimate goal is to make disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8 mtn: </span><span class="font11">Field service announcements. Song 81 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 6</span></p>

Stress the importance of good preparation (par. 10); let publishers illustrate this by relating personal experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 min: “Can You Have a Part in Disciple-Making?” Talk by elder emphasizing that it is a Christian responsibility for all to share in telling the good news and in making disciples. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Raise the question: But can all really have a part in disciple-making? Have three publishers, prepared in advance, relate the three experiences in the article. After each experience, ask for similar experiences that local publishers may know about. Draw comments from the audience as to how it is possible for all to share in disciple-making. Show ways in which we all can have a part in this vital activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font11">Field service announcements. Song 89 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Song 17 and general announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Opposition Overcome, Evidence of Backing by God’s Spirit. Talk highlighting Jesus’ promise at Acts 1:8. Use material from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1979 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> to prove that God's spirit backs those who serve him and helps to turn back Devil-inspired opposition.

Mob action failed: p. 208 (13 to p. 209 1*3; p. 218 fl2 to p. 219 fll. Bans and censorship overcome: p. 139 fl to p. 141 H4; p. 149 f3 to p. 150 13. Police action backfired: p. 110 f2 to p. 112 1[4. Hypocrisy of clergy aids honest-hearted ones: p. 102 f3 to p. 103 K2. In conclusion encourage brothers to read </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook-</span><span class="font11"> upbuilding experiences remind us that Jehovah is truly with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">How Helpful Have the Meetings for Field Service Been to You? Handled by elder who has frequently conducted these meetings and does well. Point to the purpose of these meetings: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">To help prepare publishers to be better equipped for field service.</span><span class="font11"> Draw audience into discussion with questions such as: Have you found these discussions immediately before you go in field service helpful? In what way? What can you do to contribute to the effectiveness of these meetings? To illustrate value of these meetings, conduct the current discussion on “Listening to People We Talk To,” letting audience serve as publishers who have met for service. If time permits, entertain experiences from audience showing successful applications of points from Meetings for Field Service. If you have not gone to a meeting for field service, discuss outlined material with car group or while en route to territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font11">Suggest that audience bring their copies of March 22, 1979, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aviake! </span><span class="font11">with them for next week’s meeting. Field service announcements. Song 57 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Does Disco Glorify God? Discussion based on the material in the first three articles in the March 22, 1979, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> making local application. Draw out the information in the articles by involving the audience with questions such as: What is disco? How popular is it in our community? Why do people go to discos? What evidence is there that disco has homosexual roots? Why is this a matter of concern to Christians? Why are disco’s roots in ancient fertility dances also a matter of concern to Christians? While not all discos may be the same, what are the outstanding characteristics of disco ? Are these things that glorify God? Why are disco movies such as “Saturday Night Fever” objectionable to Christians? What spiritual as well as physical dangers are encountered at many discos?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“How Christians Should View Disco.” Talk and discussion of final article on disco in March 22, 1979, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font11"> Raise and discuss following questions, drawing comments from audience: (Read applicable paragraphs.) What advice was given a teen-ager by a disco magazine? What are some of these harsh realities in the world today that are so often confronted at discos? How have some Christians been harmed spiritually by going to discos? What evidence is there that just because something is enjoyable, that does not make it pleasing to God? Although social gatherings can be upbuilding and fine, emphasize the need to watch one’s conduct. Explain what developed at early Christian “love feasts.” Encourage all to work together to keep the Christian congregation free from the unrestrained spirit of the world. At all times our conduct should glorify God.—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font11">Discussion of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> insert from the beginning of article to the end of the section “Maintaining Honorable Conduct” (pars. 1-13). While this will primarily be a talk, elder should bring audience into discussion by asking questions that highlight such main points as making plans now to attend, commendation for improved conduct, applying Bible principles daily. Emphasize thoughts especially applying to your congregation.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The 1979 “Living Hope” District Conventions promise to be of high spiritual quality. These are crucial days, and as Jehovah continues to pour out his spirit upon all his faithful servants, they are strengthened to “stand” in this trialsome time. (Rom. 14:4) The February 1 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and the February insert of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font13"> provide detailed information as to locations of the 93 district conventions for the United States in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese and Korean. Have you made definite arrangements to attend? Much work has already been done in arranging for these conventions to be held in the continental United States alone. Because of their number these gatherings will, for the most part, be smaller and more convenient.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Your determination to be there must be accompanied by good planning if you are to benefit fully from the assembly arrangements. To that end we are providing the following information.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAINING HONORABLE CONDUCT: </span><span class="font13">Most of you will recall that last year much was said in the April </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font13"> insert regarding the undesirable conduct and appearance of some of our brothers while attending assemblies over the past several years. So reproachful had some of these matters become that the Society even addressed this situation on the circuit assembly program and gave pointed counsel on how to correct it. Did you observe the favorable response to this counsel at the convention you attended? We did, and we were very pleased to see that most brothers took the counsel to heart and did something positive about it. (Heb. 12:4-11) This brings joy to the hearts of all of us, not to mention the joy it must bring to Jehovah’s heart since his name is involved.—Prov. 27:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> You will be interested in some of the reports and comments following the international conventions last summer. Note this comment from a publisher: “For several years now I have been dismayed at the misconduct of quite a few of the brothers at assemblies; pushing and harsh words in waiting lines, filthy bathrooms, unruly crowds roaming hallways during sessions, etc. This year the assembly . . . was the most refreshing experience I can remember. The crowd there was the quietest, most orderly, obedient, and Christlike one I’ve seen in quite a few years. Most of the 400 rooms in the hotel where we stayed were occupied by Witnesses, and I have never seen a finer group. The pool was never crowded or noisy, the bathing suits were modest and becoming, nobody drank alcohol publicly and . . . the friends treated the employees as if they ran the best hotel in the world.” Is it not refreshing to hear about such fine conduct? The regional manager of a motel chain said: “I can’t recall ever having such a large group that exemplified their beliefs so tremendously as the Jehovah’s Witnesses. We hope you will return.” This demonstrates that fine conduct is not only refreshing to us, but also refreshing to many yet in the world who observe us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The motel manager in one city where conventions were held stated:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">“The guests that we have served who are Jehovah’s Witnesses are undoubtedly the finest people that I have encountered. They have occupied many rooms here and there has never been a single instance of damage, they pay promptly and never disturb the other motel guests. To illustrate how impeccably honest these people are, I would like to tell you of an incident that occurred here. One of the Witnesses took a small washcloth when he left. It may have gotten mixed up with clothing. He mailed the washcloth back, along with an apology. I am sure that the cost of mailing, the package far exceeded the value of the washcloth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Such comments make us happy to call those who display such conduct our “brother” or “sister,” do they not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>c</sup>This does not mean that we should not give more attention to the matter. As an example, note what another manager had to say about some of the brothers staying at his motel this past summer. After commenting about the tendency of parents to have too many children occupying one room he reported: “They would take the mattress off the bed and lay it on the floor to make extra bedding. They also used the bedspreads for the same purpose. Feeding children in the room and getting cereal on the carpet was a problem.” A brother in another city said that the conduct last summer was “a little better, though children still are a problem to control as parents tend to let them run around loose in spite of the articles in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service”</span><span class="font13"> and so forth. What can be done about this, brothers? </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Greater effort must</span><span class="font13"> be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">made by all of us and our children to exercise self-control and orderliness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> The good conduct generally displayed at our conventions certainly should not be limited to assembly time. If we find that conforming to the fine standard of conduct expected at larger conventions of Jehovah’s people makes us feel cramped or takes away from our enjoyment of the occasion in some way, then we should do some serious thinking about how we conduct ourselves at the local Kingdom Hall and, more importantly, in our own homes. Is it not true that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">everything</span><span class="font13"> we do and say can either bring praise and honor to Jehovah or bring reproach to him? Surely as servants of Jehovah we desire to honor his name at all times.—Col. 3:23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> At the root of the matter is the question: How successful am I in applying Bible principles? (Eph. 4:20-24) Those principles include modesty and cleanliness. Certainly we should want to be well groomed, clean, dressed in good taste and modestly. We do not want to be causes for stumbling on the part of others. (1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 31-33) Cleanliness and neatness should be characteristic of us every day so that it does not require unusual effort for us to avoid littering the assembly grounds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Knowing that others want to enjoy the program, we will not distract them by moving about or talking unnecessarily. We should be in our seats when the program starts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Likewise, love will prevent us from being inattentive to the needs of others by wanting to be first in lines or by failing to notice that they do not have a seat. Let us be willing to help others and do what we can to accommodate them. (Luke 6:31) In this way we cooperate with those who may specially volunteer as attendants, food service and cleaning personnel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Sometimes negative comments about conduct at assemblies have to do with young ones. Since we live in a corrupt and permissive society, great effort is required to shape youthful personalities in harmony with Jehovah’s will. By giving attention to matters like this at home, we are less likely to experience such problems at assemblies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> Since many of us include attending the assembly during our vacation period, we should be careful that the convention spirit does not become a vacation spirit. Otherwise, this may cause the importance of the convention to fade in the minds of ourselves or of our children. Should this be allowed to happen, it would interfere with our joy in assembling as Jehovah’s people, due to the fact that our minds would be preoccupied with having a good time in a fleshly way rather than with the good spiritual things that Jehovah is providing.—2 Tim. 3:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> We want to continue working hard to keep our conduct above reproach. EVERY CHRISTIAN, ESPECIALLY ELDERS, PARENTS AND MATURE PUBLISHERS, SHOULD FEEL PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE TO AID DISORDERLY ONES AMONG US, DEDICATED OR NOT, TO CHANGE THEIR CONDUCT WHILE WITH US BY KINDLY HELPING THEM TO ACT PROPERLY. (Gal. 6:1; Lev. 18:26; 19:17) In such cases, if elders or parents are not present and cannot be readily found, then any Christian present could calmly and kindly point out that Jehovah’s name and our reputation are involved. By assisting everyone among us to appreciate this, no doubt we will regain and maintain our fine reputation in those areas where it has been damaged.—1 Tim. 3:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL MORNING FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font13">Field service at assemblies such as was enjoyed at the “Victorious Faith” conventions last summer was a delightful success. Truly Jehovah’s blessing was evident as indicated by the expressions of appreciation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hawaii: “In addition to the many cars, 51 busloads of publishers were taken out into the service during the two conventions held. 70% of the Island was covered. Fine experiences were had and many Bible studies were started.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New Orleans: “My wife and I went with a group street witnessing on Friday morning. We can honestly say that we have never enjoyed ourselves more or felt Jehovah’s spirit more strongly on us in service than we did on this occasion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Pittsburgh: “Friday seemed to be the most outstanding day. Never have I seen such enthusiasm to share in the field service. At least 80% of the convention shared in the field service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service Plans</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> At most conventions, service in the field will be on Friday at 9 a.m. from the various Kingdom Halls set aside for this purpose, as well as from motels and hotels where large groups of brothers are accommodated. In order to engage together in the field service, it would be good if elders and ministerial servants could serve as captains of groups from their congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>ie</sup>On the afternoon program of the previous day, details of the simplified and effective campaign of action will be set forth. Various features of field service will be arranged: Territory will be available for house-to-house service. Informal witnessing can be done wherever- one meets people. Street work may be appropriate as well as witnessing at other public places. Some may wish to engage in the store-to-store work and invite business people to the assembly sessions and public lecture.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> Each one should bring a small witnessing bag, together with his Bible. Something special will be provided that can be enthusiastically featured as the offer. Details will be given at the convention itself. Plan to share in the field activity at this year’s “Living Hope” District Convention. Be sure to report your field service to your local congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font13">What a fine example Jesus set for us in being humbly attentive to the needs of others! This same fine spirit is reflected in many ways by those who volunteer to work at conventions. To fill the needs of the convention departments brothers in charge have been inviting others to work with them. However, some larger departments such as Attendant, Food Service, Cleaning and Auditing will still need many more volunteers than these brothers know personally. Your congregation’s convention coordinator will receive a form listing departments still in need of volunteers and he will make this known in the congregation. You may have your name listed on the form under the department in which you would like to work for the entire convention. He will then return this form to the assembly. Through the convention coordinators in each congregation, volunteers will be informed as to where they should report. This arrangement allows for individuals to work together with those from their own congregation or circuit and for children to work along with their parents.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> The convention organization will again be selecting congregations to share in onetime work assignments in several departments. Such an arrangement not only fills a vital need in departments such as cleaning, but also provides an opportunity for those who cannot work all four days to share in the organized effort to care for the needs of their brothers. The convention organization will advise your congregation of the need and your elders will select a capable captain for a group to work along with you in caring for this special one-time assignment. Such assignments involve part of one day of the convention usually before, between, or after the sessions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> Of course, there will always be some need for last-minute volunteers. If you want to volunteer, please go to the Volunteer Service desk. They will let you know where help is needed. Your willing service will be very much appreciated.—Acts 20:35; Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD SERVICE: </span><span class="font13">Since we have assembled to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">benefit from the spiritual program, is it not wise to involve as few as possible in the preparation and serving of material food? Really, only a few things are necessary. (Luke 10:42) As a result of simplifying our food service operation, last year in the United States over 70,000 brothers who used to work hard during the sessions to provide us food were able to hear the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> Effort is being made to further improve the simplified feeding arrangement. You will be pleased to know that the breakfast menu is being enlarged from what we had last year. Also, a fresh vegetable bag will be offered where possible and orange juice will be available at noon as well as breakfast. We may be confident that at all the conventions there will be suitable food that has been lovingly provided by our brothers for our convenience and enjoyment.—Prov. 15:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION TICKETS: </span><span class="font13">Once again the $1.00 convention tickets in 10c segments will be available for use at'the conventions for the purchase of food only. So that less money handling will be required at the convention itself, as well as to eliminate long lines at the cashiers on the first day, we are recommending that, to the extent possible, each one who will be attending a convention should purchase ahead of time a sufficient supply of tickets for at least two or three days of the convention. These tickets will be made available to your congregation by the convention organization a number of weeks in advance and you may purchase them through the congregation at that time. Your cooperation in obtaining and using the tickets will be appreciated and will contribute much to the smooth operation of the convention feeding program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSIC: </span><span class="font13">Special music for the interludes and for audience singing is again being prepared by the Society. This specially prepared music will be presented by tape recording to give real uniformity to this important feature of the program at all the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>25</sup> We trust that this information will be helpful to you in making your plans to attend the “Living Hope” District Convention. Your determination and effort to make your attendance a reality will undoubtedly result in a blessing for you and your family.—Rom. 1:11, 12; Gen. 32:24-29.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark7"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font11">Any desiring rooms who have not as yet sent in a Room Request form should fill one out neatly and accurately and turn it in to the congregation convention coordinator. He will carefully check it over, sign and mail it to the rooming address noted on the back of the form for the convention city where you wall attend. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans, please immediately advise (1) the landlord and (2) the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There will be no trailer camps at the U.S. conventions, but the Rooming Department for each convention will gladly furnish available information on any commercial facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font11">At most locations, the immersion will be on Saturday. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should review the 80 questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book with the elders prior to the convention. Bathing suits and towels should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font11">Plan to enjoy the entire program, which will begin each morning by 9:30 and ■wall conclude each afternoon at approximately 5:00 p.m. Of course, at most conventions Friday morning will be set aside for field service. Thus, the convention program that day will begin at 2 p.m. We encourage you not to leave the assembly prior to the conclusion at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font11">All </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font11"> pioneers should bring their Pioneer Identification and Assignment card to the convention. You may present this card to the proper cashier on the first day of the convention and receive $14.00 worth of convention tickets for obtaining food. The cashier will simply date stamp the back of your Pioneer Identification and Assignment card in the upper left-hand corner to show that you received the tickets. Literature will be available to pioneers at pioneer rates at the bookroom. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. All those in special full-time service (traveling overseers, Bethel service and special pioneers) will continue to receive from the Society the Convention Pioneer Identification card as in the past. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font11">No doubt all will enjoy wearing the cards as a means of advertising the convention and to become acquainted with other brothers and sisters in attendance. By wearing the lapel card while traveling to and from the convention, you may contribute further to the convention witness. You will note that this year the lapel card is designed in such a way that it may be used again for circuit assemblies in addition to the district convention. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font11">Regardless of the convention you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk if possible. Also, beware of pickpockets. Do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Disciple-Making? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ies due to her limitations, would you not agree that she has an important part in disciple-making?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Children likewise can share in making disciples. True, not all may be capable of conducting successful Bible studies. Yet all can have a share in aiding people to receive the life-giving waters of truth. —Compare 2 Kings 5:2-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Demonstrating how young publishers can enlist the help of others in making disciples is the experience of a young publisher in Italy. Because of his exemplary conduct in school, he was awarded a badge that had a cross on it. The boy thanked his teacher, but explained to her that he could not accept the award because the cross is a pagan symbol. The teacher said this was impossible. So the boy offered to have his mother explain. A Bible study was started and the schoolteacher, as well as her children, responded and came into the truth. Surely that young publisher, too, had a part in making disciples, do you not agree?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The fact is, one does not need to know a whole lot about the truth in order to have a part in disciplemaking. The key is to have </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a love for what one does know, and a desire to share this with others.</span><span class="font12"> A five-year-old Canadian girl, whose mother was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, liked so much what her mother read to her from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> book that she insisted that her baby-sitter read the book to her as well. The more she read, the more interested the teen-age baby-sitter became. Within a year, not only did the five-year-old’s mother get baptized, but so did four other persons who became interested as a result of the little girl talking to her baby-sitter!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> No, disciple-making is not just for a few. The whole congregation can and needs to become involved. It is a Christian commission to become disciple-makers! (Matt. 28: 19, 20) Each of us can share by warmly welcoming new ones and making them feel at home at our meetings. Time and again the friendly family spirit at the Kingdom Hall has been a major factor in convincing persons that we indeed are Christ’s true followers. (John 13:34, 35) Also, our comments at the meetings can help in making disciples. Some new ones have been especially impressed by the heartfelt comments of children and teen-agers. If we all have disciple-making as our goal, we can anticipate that many more of the Lord’s “sheep” will be added to our congregations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spreading the Good News </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">reminds himself that he is battling with demon-inspired ideas and attitudes. We can gain joy in knowing that we are on God’s side in this battle against the evil influence exercised by Satan and his demons.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Another enemy of joy can be doubt, or a lack of faith. It is a “sin that easily entangles us,” the apostle Paul said. (Heb. 12:1; Jas. 1:5-7) Do you </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font12"> believe “the good news of the kingdom”? Are you </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">convinced</span><span class="font12"> that God’s kingdom will soon wipe out the wicked old system, along with all who cling to it, and bring in those grand conditions for which we earnestly long? Some publishers have allowed doubts to develop and have lost joy as a result. But if you really believe God’s promises—and if you keep your vision bright—this will help you to spread the good news with joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Yet, as noted before, peoples’ indifference and even opposition to our evangelizing efforts dampen the joy of some publishers. What can such publishers do to keep their joy alive?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW MANY MAINTAIN JOY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> Many maintain their joy by regularly reflecting on the wonderful Bible truths that they possess, and how vital it is that others hear them.</span><span class="font12"> (Jer. 15:16) Just think: “Those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus,” the Bible says, “will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction.” (2 Thess. 1:6-9) They must be given repeated opportunities to respond to the Kingdom message. Why? Because their pattern of response is the very basis on which God will judge them, either as worthy of life or as fit for destruction. (1 Tim. 4:16) Realizing this fact, can we not find joy as we persevere in bringing information that can preserve the lives of sheeplike ones?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> We can if we have genuine love and concern for the welfare of people. Do you? Jehovah, the God we worship, does. He does not want any to be destroyed, but wishes that all would respond and gain life. (Ezek. 33:11; 2 Pet. 3:9) That is one reason why he is having the good news preached. Tender affection for people moved the apostle Paul and his companions to impart to others, not only the good news, but, as he put it, “also our own souls.” (1 Thess. 2:8) A similar desire to help people will also aid us to maintain joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Additionally, as one brother put it: “Joy is often linked with success, and success with good preparation.” Yes, having well-prepared</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">Scriptural topics to discuss contributes to success in the preaching work, and, in turn, joy. When householders listen, share ‘■in the conversation and accept Bible truths, preaching is pleasurable. And when, on return visits, they respond to encouragement to read and study the Bible, our joy increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">y But this is also an important point: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our joy cannot simply be dependent on the response of people to the good news.</span><span class="font12"> In some territories few if any respond, at least not for many weeks, months and sometimes years. (Jer. 7:27) Yet it is still possible to maintain joy. “I feel good after spending an afternoon in the preaching work,” explains one brother, “simply knowing that I have had a share in the work God has commissioned us to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> May many, many more of us realize the joys of sharing in the disciple-making work! Maintain your joy in the assurance that the good news you bear is the most precious gift you could offer anyone, and that Jehovah is pleased with your work.—Heb. 6:10; Neh. 8:10.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Our Topic for Conversation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What are humankind’s greatest needs? Would not a good and righteous government be high on the list? Yes, we need rulership by God. For several months now we have been pointing out that ‘God’s Kingdom Is the Solution.’ We have shown people that the Kingdom for which we pray is a real government, one that can solve their problems. For the months of May through August, the suggested Topic for Conversation will be “Put Your Trust in Government by God,” based on Psalm 146. So we do well to acquaint ourselves with that Psalm. This will equip us to use from it what we feel is appropriate, depending on the householder ana the circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> After introducing ourselves to the householder, we might say: “We have come to share a message of hope with you. Would you like to live in a world where there would be true peace and security? [Allow householder to comment.] That is something we also would like, and it emphasizes the need for good government that can ensure such security. But, all of us are faced with the fact that human efforts have failed to make this possible. Wisely, then, the Bible counsels us: [Read Psalm 146:3.] Some leaders may be sincere. They may do some good. But what happens to them? Notice what verse 4 says: [Read.] Did you notice why God advises us not to pin our hopes on humans? [Let householder comment, maybe directing his attention to phrases “to whom no salvation belongs,” “his thoughts do perish.”] We need something better, something permanent—a ruler whose beneficial government will remain.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If the householder shows interest and does not seem pressed for time, we might continue: “Who do you think can satisfy mankind’s need?” No matter how the householder answers, we can then read verses 5 and 6, which give the Bible answer. Afterward we can emphasize: “The Creator can bring this good government, God’s kingdom. He is the only one who can.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The next point to consider is the effect that God’s kingdom will have on its subjects. “What benefits could we expect from God’s rule?” we might ask. After listening to the householder’s comments, we can direct his attention to verses 7 through 9. We might say: “As I read these verses note the benefits</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">God’s rule promises to bring.” After reading let the householder express himself if he wishes to do so. Fi-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">nally, using the last verse of this Psalm, emphasize the grand superiority of God’s government—its ruler lives forever, “for generation after generation.” When making the offer of three pocket-size books for $1.00, be prepared to point out something in one of the books that you feel will be of interest to the householder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If the householder seems too busy to pursue the discussion suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4, we might simply say: “We are calling to brighten your day with a message of hope. We think you will agree that human governments cannot solve man’s problems. That is the point made here in this Bible Psalm at verse 3. [Read.] Lasting solutions to man’s problems can only come through God’s kingdom government by Christ. That is the central theme of the Bible and it is beautifully explained in these three publications that we are leaving for only $1.00.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If we are familiar with the whole of Psalm 146, and we note on our house-to-house record just how much of this Psalm we discussed with individuals who manifested interest, then we may be able to use other verses in the same Psalm on the return visit. For example, if we did not have an opportunity to consider verses 7 to 9 on the initial visit, we may use them on the return visit. Afterward we can lead into a consideration of chapter 1 of either </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Good News—to Make You Happy</span><span class="font12"> or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Of course, in talking about government, the problems that exist today and the need for good government, we want to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">exercise discretion.</span><span class="font12"> We do not want to leave any wrong impressions. Being neutral, we do not get involved in political controversies. We are advocates only of God’s kingdom, which is no part of this world. —John 18:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> It is good for us to remember that we are interested in making disciples in harmony with Matthew 28:19, 20. So we should think of how we can effectively lead our discussions into a Bible study. The more familiar we become with Psalm 146, the easier we will find it to go from one of the many interesting points in it to a corresponding point in one of our publications.</span></p>

Congregations should immediately order the additional distributor’s copies they feel they can use.</span></p>

It is suggested that congregations order now so that they will have the brochure on hand in time to be used by the brothers. The ratio for ordering for your congregation should be based on 20 copies for each pioneer and 7 copies for each congregation publisher.</span></p>

Can be presented in the form of a talk and can read certain pertinent sentences. Invite audience to follow closely in their copies. These are “reminders” of things many publishers will recall from previous assemblies, so can move quickly from one point to another. Conclude by reading John 13:35 and comment on the spirit that will undoubtedly move all of us to assist and encourage one another to attend and benefit fully from this “Living Hope” District Convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This is the fifth month for this special audience-participation meeting part. Work needs to be done on it WELL IN ADVANCE. During May, regular meeting attenders will spend up to 24 hours at congregation meetings. Have we been using what we have learned there? Remind the brothers early in the month that they will be asked about it during this meeting part. Continue to emphasize that what is wanted is not simply a recitation of what they have learned from the meetings, but how they have actually used or benefited from what was presented at these meetings.</span></p>

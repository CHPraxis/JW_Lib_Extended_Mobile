<p><span class="font3">1. Why is it advantageous not to introduce yourself in the same way all the time?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Questions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Why is it good to use questions to involve the householder in conversation? (Compare Luke 10:36.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What kind of questions do you find it better to avoid, and why?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1. Why is it important to follow </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Appreciate What Jesus Christ Did for You?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> No other man who has ever lived on earth could do what Jesus Christ did for mankind. He has aided us to receive the greatest gift anyone can obtain, everlasting life. Yet, most people have little appreciation for what he did. How about you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Lack of appreciation is a serious matter, and especially is this so with regard to our attitude toward the Son of God. (Heb. 10:28, 29) In contrast, how can we show that we are truly appreciative? For one thing, we will surely be in attendance at the Memorial on Wednesday evening, April 11. But more is involved than that. We can be helped to realize this by reviewing briefly a few of the thrilling events during Jesus’ last six days on earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NISAN 9</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> On his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Sunday, Nisan 9, the disciples were overjoyed at seeing “the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name!” Their appreciation for the Messianic king moved them to “rejoice and praise God with a loud voice concerning all the powerful works they had seen.” (Luke 19:37, 38) If you had been present that day, undoubtedly you would have shared in praising God. Would you have had the same appreciation a week, months, or even years later?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The expressions of praise were so important that Jesus said: “If these [disciples] remained silent, the stones would cry out.” (Luke 19:40) If the stones had done so,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Is Your Witnessing Purposeful?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What do Jesus’ words at Matthew 24:14 and 28:19, 20 mean to you? As disciples of God’s Son, do we see the urgent need not only to proclaim the “good news,” but also to make disciples of responsive ones, teaching them to observe the commandments of Jesus? The carrying out of this commission puts real purpose into the work that we do in the field service. We will approach people not only to place literature, but also to discuss the Bible with them. Our main objective will be to start Bible studies with persons in order to help them to become true disciples. With this in mind, we will take note of those who show even a little interest in the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Our attitude is important. Do would that not have revealed a lack of appreciation on the part of the disciples? Today Christ is actively ruling as King with his Father. Do we truly appreciate what that means? If so, we will be ‘rejoicing and praising God with a loud voice’ in the field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NISAN 10. 11</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> On Monday, Nisan 10, the chief priests and scribes schemed to destroy Jesus, “for they were in fear of him, for all the crowd was continually being astounded at his teaching.” (Mark 11:18) Despite this religious opposition, Jesus courageously “entered into the temple and . . . overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.” (Mark 11:15) What high regard he showed for Jehovah’s worship! It is true that we are not authorized to take physical action against those practicing wrong things, but we can be both courageous and zealous as Jesus was for Jehovah’s worship. (Compare the similar action at John 2:14-17.) Do we personally show such qualities for Jehovah’s worship?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> On the next day, Tuesday, Nisan 11, the Son of God fearlessly denounced the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. Right in Jerusalem he told them: “You shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men; for you yourselves do not go in, neither do you permit those on their way in to go in.” (Matt. 23:13) At the same time, Jesus </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2) </span><span class="font10">we really </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font10"> to make a disciple for Christ? Are we willing to put forth the effort? Instead of simply spending a little time in the field service once in a while, are we willing to set aside time on a regular basis to conduct a Bible study? Doing so, we will find our witnessing will become more purposeful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do we make the finding of sheeplike ones and the desire for a Bible study a subject of our prayers? (1 John 5:14) After praying, do we become easily discouraged if such prayers seemingly go unanswered for a time? Or, do we persevere in our prayers and work in harmony with what we are praying for?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> We realize, of course, that not everyone is going to agree to have </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 118 and general announcements. Please encourage audience to read the portions in the book of Mark suggested in the chart under Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">30 min: “Do You Appreciate What Jesus Christ Did for You?” Discuss article with good audience participation. The material in the article should be thoroughly covered, using the questions found in the paragraphs in an effort to help the audience make personal application. As a conclusion, ask the audience: What did you learn from this discussion? How should appreciation for what Jesus did affect our lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Have You Invited All to Come to the Memorial? Who should be invited? (Bible students, interested persons, relatives, neighbors, acquaintances, inactive publishers, people who have stopped studying) Invite brothers or sisters to demonstrate briefly how to reach these ihdivlduals. Have the audience comment on why the things said by the publishers could be helpful. Conclude by asking what might be done <sub>: </sub>to reach those whom we cannot find at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Share points from latest magazines that could be used in field service. Do not merely call attention to the titles of the articles, but to specific points that might be helpful to the brothers. Publishers should have been encouraged to bring their own copies of the latest magazines for this part. Urge all to participate in the field service during the weekend. Song 32 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elders may decide if a Theocratic School and service meeting should be scheduled for this week in view of the Memorial. If service meeting is held, you may include the article “Youths— Are You on the Road to Real Success?” in the April 1, 1979, issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 1 and general announcements. Comments on John 15:16 as it relates to fruitbearing, and what is meant by having our fruit remain. (Compare John 15:5, 6; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">w78 12/15,</span><span class="font8"> p.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22, fl2, 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Experiences from publishers on use of subscription offer. (Have one or two prepared ahead of time.) Display latest April magazines and comment on them, making local application to field service. Have well-prepared, qualified young publisher demonstrate offering two latest April magazines, using a simplified form of the Topic for Conversation and a particular article. Have audience comment on why it and others would be effective in your territory. Also, mention that the new paper used in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> has made the magazines more attractive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font8">“Is Your Witnessing Purposeful?” Discussion involving audience by means of thought-provoking questions. Highlight paragraphs </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font8">in article by reading them. Advise congregation of the number of return visits and Bible studies being conducted locally and the number of publishers sharing in these activities. As time permits, work in local experiences of those having success in Bible study work and get their viewpoint toward it. Are there any young publishers conducting studies? How do they enjoy it? Highlight throughout discussion that our purpose is not just to place literature, but to find and feed sheeplike ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">“Presenting the Good News— Are You Effectively Covering Your Territory?” Read and thoroughly discuss each paragraph with audience. Stress point made that we are interested in making disciples, not just covering territory or placing literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font8">Announcements on times and locations of meetings for field service, and current offer to be used. Be sure to bring your </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1979 Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> to service meeting next week. Song 68 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font8">Introduction, song 31 and general announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">What Are We Doing with What We Are Learning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Work needs to be done on this part WELL IN ADVANCE. Many fine field points and suggestions to help in our everyday lives are considered at our meetings. Are we using what is being brought to our attention? On this part, use 5 minutes to consider special public talk and 10 minutes for the Theocratic School. Early in the month assign one or two book study groups to be prepared to cover each of these two meetings. Ask them to be alert to use points gleaned from the material discussed at these meetings. It may be that certain material will help them to make personal decisions, having something to use in informal or in house-to-house witnessing, when making return visits or in stimulating the interest of Bible students in our meetings. During the part, publishers from the groups can then tell their experiences, highlignting the value</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing Purposeful? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a home Bible study. Often those to whom we talk do not appreciate the Kingdom message. Is that going to make us give up? Just think how Jeremiah felt when preaching for 40 years with very little response. He got discouraged, but he also got over it and kept on doing the work that Jehovah had assigned to him. (Jer. 20:9) It was not his privilege to help large numbers of persons to change their course and do Jehovah’s will, but he did see fruitage from his labors. Ebed-melech and the sons of Jonadab were spared when Jerusalem was destroyed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Similarly, in our day, there are publishers who have engaged in the field service for many years, seemingly with very limited results. However, because of their perseverance, they have been privileged to aid a few, in various ways, to take hold of the truth, and so these too have the prospect of deliverance, at the coming “great tribulation.” Constancy in Jehovah’s service, along with a genuine interest in helping people, has brought them much joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Now, what about yourself? Undoubtedly there are publishers that you know who are having good </span><span class="font8">of what we have learned. This should not be a review of the material. Tell the congregation that we are going to do this again next month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">30 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font8">“Declaration of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font8">Faith.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(.yb79</span><span class="font8"> pp. 256-259) As time permits, elder handling this part should read material paragraph by paragraph, using the following questions as a basis for discussion: Pars. 1, 2: What is faith? What do we need to keep on doing respecting our faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Par. 3: What world developments convince us that “seeking first the kingdom” is the only right course? How do we demonstrate that this is what we are doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Par. 4: What are some of the sad consequences resulting from ignorance of the Bible? What proof do we have that living by the Bible produces marvelous results? How can we show that true faith has a wholesome effect on people’s lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pars. 5, 6: Why can we be confident that Jehovah will grant success to our efforts to help others spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pars. 7, 8: What hope do we have for the future, and why are we confident of its fulfillment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pars. 9, 10: What determination did we express in the “Declaration”? How do we show that this continues to be our resolve ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pars. 11, 12: How can we continue to demonstrate that we have complete confidence in Jehovah God and in his Son?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Par. 13: Conclude with encouragement for all to continue thinking about what we have resolved and to live up to it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font8">Field service announcements, song 7 and prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">success in disciple-making. Why not invite them to share with you some of their methods and viewpoints toward their service? No doubt this would be very encouraging to you as you endeavor to increase your own effectiveness and joy in disciple-making.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> It has been noted that those most successful in making disciples are those interested in people more than hours or placements. They are ‘people-conscious’ and Biblestudy conscious. At each door, where possible, some of them say to the householder: “We are calling to offer a free home Bible study and are prepared to give you a brief demonstration of how it would be conducted.” This may be very effective. On one occasion, a publisher in the house-to-house work was asked by the householder soon after he began his presentation: “What do you want? Get to the point.” So the publisher answered: “I would like to offer you a free home Bible study.” The householder accepted it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Do you have a positive attitude toward disciple-making through Bible study activity? Truly, putting forth the effort to make disciples can bring us many rewards and blessings.</span></p>

It was on that same day, outside of Jerusalem, that Jesus gave his disciples the outstanding prophecy about the sign of his presence and the conclusion of the system of things. He urged his disciples then, and us today, not to let other affairs of life distract from the importance of these events. Pointedly he said: ‘Pay attention to yourselves so that your hearts may never become weighed down with overeating, and heavy drinking, and anxieties of life.’ (Luke 21:34) How much do we appreciate what he said? Is the message that he delivered back then as important to us as it is to him?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> On that same day Jesus drew attention to a woman who discerned the preciousness of the things of God. He pointed out a widow in the temple who had dropped into the treasury chest two coins of very little value. But, as Jesus explained, this was “all the means of living she had.” (Luke 21:1-4) Do the things that we do to advance the interests of true worship show that we appreciate it as much as she did?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> On Wednesday, Nisan 12, Jesus did not return to Jerusalem. But the Bible tells us he was anointed with very expensive perfumed oil by a woman named Mary. As Jesus said, ‘She did it in preparation for my burial.’ (John 12:7) He appreciated her kindness so much that he said: “Wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did shall also be told as a remembrance of her.” (Matt. 26:13) This incident sparked the greed of Judas. He “went to the chief priests” to bargain with them as to what they would give him for betraying Jesus.—-Matt. 26:14, 15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Before sundown, Thursday, Nisan 13, God’s Son made arrangements for his last passover with the disciples. Nisan 14 began about 6 p.m., and Jesus faced a very difficult 20 hours or so. At the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Passover meal he washed the feet of his apostles, including those of Judas. This was a special night for the Son of God and for his apostles. He said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this passover with you.” (Luke 22:15) How difficult it must have been for Jesus to know that Judas, eating right there with the other apostles, would betray him! After they ate the Passover meal, Judas left, and Jesus instituted with the eleven faithful apostles the memorial of his own death. When the betrayer left the table, Jesus knew that his most difficult hours were fast approaching. The fulfillment of his Father’s Word and the life prospects of all mankind depended on what he would do. Before singing praises to God and departing for the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed, not only for himself, but for individuals who had not as yet even put faith in him. (John 17:20) What unselfish love for people!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Out in Gethsemane, he repeatedly prayed with deep feeling to his Father. He had told three of his disciples: “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.” (Matt. 26:38) But, failing to appreciate the significance of what was about to take place, they fell asleep. Soon the betrayer appeared, along with a great crowd that had swords and clubs. While the disciples fled, Jesus was taken into custody.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> After being betrayed, Jesus spent the rest of the night and the following morning before the chief priests, the Sanhedrin, Herod and Pilate. Finally, around three o’clock Friday afternoon, Nisan 14, as he hung from the torture stake, Jesus declared: “It has been accomplished!” “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” When he had said this, he expired.—John 19:30; Luke 23:46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> What' a fine record of courage and loyalty! However, what Jesus did was not for his own glory. It was to honor his Father. Also, the apostle Peter said: “Christ suffered for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">YOU.”</span><span class="font10"> How should we show appreciation for his outstanding and unselfish way of life on our behalf? Not only by attending the Memorial. As Peter stated: “Christ suffered for you, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.”</span><span class="font10"> (1 Pet. 2:21) Yes, in every way, let us show deep appreciation for what Jesus did, striving every day to do things that will contribute to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Effectively Covering Your Territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Did you know that,<sup>4</sup> on the average, for every publisher in the United States there are about 403 persons needing to hear the “good news”? Why is it vital that all be contacted with the Kingdom message? It is because their very lives are at stake, as well as our own. (Ezek. 3:17-19; 33:6; 1 Tim. 4:16) Many people are still responding to the “good news” throughout the country. So, we should be interested not just in how many times we can cover our territory in a given period or in how much literature we can place, but in how many persons we can reach with our Scriptural message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In order to cover our territory thoroughly, we should not overlook the value of keeping an accurate record of those who are not at home. Do you keep such a record? And then, do you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font10"> back and try to contact the people who live in each one of those homes? As you know, on your first return call you still may not find them at home. But try again. If repeated calls do not yield results, why not try the telephone or perhaps write them a letter? Do not give up until you get in touch with them. They need to hear the “good news.” None of us should feel that a territory has been covered if we still have even a few homes where we have not yet contacted the occupants, either in person or by mail. However, it would be helpful to turn the territory in at least by the end of four months. It can be checked out again, if advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Those in whom we are particularly interested, of course, are those who listen appreciatively to the Kingdom message. Some of these accept literature; others simply show interest in the things that we point out to them from the Bible. In each case, however, should we not be planning to make a return visit? If we have that in mind, we ought to keep a good record showing the name of the householder and any other information that will help us to follow through on the interest already shown. Does it make sense to go on working more territory week after week if we are not calling back on interested ones that we have already located? Can we really say that we are covering our territory effectively if we fail</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">to make those return visits? Even after a territory has been turned in, we should continue to follow through on any interest that we have found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> While having in mind effective coverage of our territory, we may find that certain recommended topics for conversation are not well received in a particular territory. This may be due to religious, social or cultural backgrounds of the people there. You may then find it advisable to use another topic for conversation, perhaps from among the fine ones found in past issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font10"> that is more suitable for that type of territory. For example, we can appreciate that in some predominantly Jewish sections our approach may need to be adjusted considerably from one used in mainly Catholic territories. This would apply in other circumstances as well. By using discernment and being adaptable with our presentations, we may be able to stimulate more interest in the Bible’s message in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As we all know, there are some territories that are more productive than others. That being so, we should not insist on working all territories in a strict rotation. This means that some territory may be worked more often than other territory. Certainly, all the territory in the congregation needs to be covered, and it would be beneficial to cover all of it thoroughly at least once a year. But we are especially interested in making disciples. So, if some areas prove to be more fruitful than others, it might be beneficial to cover these more often. In his service, the apostle Paul did not cover every province in Asia Minor on the basis of strict rotation. He followed the leading of Jehovah’s spirit, and that spirit directed him into areas that proved to be fruitful in producing new praisers of Jehovah. —Acts 16:6-10, 14; 18:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The purpose of covering our territory effectively is to give people an opportunity to come to know the “good news.” As we find interest, then, we should be alert to demonstrate our Bible study arrangement so as to make disciples of sheeplike ones in obedience to Jesus’ command.</span></p>

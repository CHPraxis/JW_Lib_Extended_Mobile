<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE THAN ONE MILLION ATTEND CONVENTIONS IN U.S. We rejoice that at the 102 “Divine Love” District Conventions in the U.S. this summer, there was a new alltime peak in attendance of 1,024,126. It is also very encouraging to know that 9,617 were baptized.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8">Serving Jehovah as a Family</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2"><sup>x</sup>The family that serves Jehovah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font2"> is the basic unit of the Christian congregation today. So, while each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">individual</span><span class="font2"> Christian must have a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font2"> relationship with Jehovah, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">family</span><span class="font2"> of Christians serving together helps' to strengthen such relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Evidently this is one reason why Paul encouraged Christians to continue living with mates who were nonbelievers, saying: “For, wife, how do you know but that you will save your husband? Or, husband, how do you know but that you will save your wife?” (1 Cor. 7:16) So, as Christians, we are encouraged to worship and serve Jehovah as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO SERVE AS A FAMILY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Among early Christian families, one that was noteworthy was that of Philip “the evangelizer.” He was an active, hospitable Christian. (Acts 21:8) But his service did not stop there. As an evangelizer he apparently assisted his family to be regular in Jehovah’s service, too, for the record mentions that his four virgin daughters “prophesied.”—Acts 21:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> How can Christian families today be active, evangelizing families? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font2"> in the family must appreciate the privilege of serving Jehovah, preaching and teaching</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">Growing Spiritually as a Family</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “In an age that emphasizes maximum personal expression and gratification,” comments a family magazine, “many parents don’t want to sacrifice anything of themselves for their children, who are viewed as a burden.” A news magazine also reports that the current tendency of parents to give ‘priority to their own right to selffulfillment’ leaves their children emotionally crippled and without a moral code. This is just as the Scriptures foretold, “that in the last days . . . men will be lovers of themselves, . . . having no natural affection.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Clearly, to attain the goal of family unity and happiness, the Christian family must resist such tendencies and follow the instructions provided by the Founder of the family, Jehovah God. (Ps. 100: 3; Prov. 3:5, 6) Fathers, particularly, are charged with the responsibility of “bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:1-4. the Christian good news. (Matt. 28:19, 20) But to enjoy such godly service, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">each one</span><span class="font2"> must be prepared. So married Christians should recognize the need to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prepare</span><span class="font2"> for service together as a family, discussing points in the literature that could be used, appropriate Scripture texts and other talking points.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> Scheduling</span><span class="font2"> time for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> to share in field service is also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font2"> important. Therefore, many families are using the first Sunday of the month to work together. Concerning families working together in service the first Sunday each month, one brother wrote: “Field service has really picked up. The friends are responding to the recommendations of assisting one another, especially the youth.” Does your family thus serve together each month?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> It is very encouraging to see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font2"> families working together with their book study groups. In this way children cs well as adults share in covering the territory assigned to the group. Such working together with the group will assist parents to instill in their children greater appreciation for our responsibility to preach the good news and care for the “sheep.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Many parents assist their chil-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN BE DONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Happily, Jehovah has provided parents with many valuable aids to help the family grow spiritually, but it does take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> measure of selfdiscipline, or even self-sacrifice, to make use of and to benefit from them. For example, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font2">provides a Bible text and upbuilding comments for consideration each day. Is considering that information a part of your family’s daily routine? Showing the benefits of daily discussing a Bible text, a report from an African country where the work is banned tells how the imprisoned brothers assigned a different one of their group each day to think up a Bible text for discussion. Then each brother would give a comment on that selected text. Later they explained how very helpful it is to know many Bible verses in advance of such tests of faith. Yes, how beneficial it is for each family to cultivate such useful habits as regularly</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Song 71 and local announcements.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Discussion ot article “Serving Jehovah as a Family.” Handle with appropriate questions directed to audience. In connection with paragraphs 4 to 8, ask for suggestions or results obtained by families working together In field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font12">“Training Our Children to Be Lovers of Jehovah.” What key points do you remember from symposium on Saturday afternoon at “Divine Love” District Convention? Chairman should use appropriate questions to draw out audience on main points and consider local application of the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">(1) In raising our children to become disciples, emphasize that effort must be put forth; does not happen automatically. Discuss following scriptures, noting what </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">action</span><span class="font12"> must be taken:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Proverbs 22:6: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Train</span><span class="font12"> up a boy . . Time and effort needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ephesians 6:4: Greek expression for “bringing them up” means &quot;nourishing out,” spiritually feed, nurture ana develop them; in the discipline” refers to instructing, Involving training, education, and correction; “mentalregulating of Jehovah” means 'putting in [the child’s mind] the mind of Jehovah.’ The mind end will of Jehovah are found in the Bible. Suggest that children memorize basic Bible texts. How many have been doing so, and what are the effects? (Can review texts such as Acts 20:35; John 3:16; Eph. 6:1; Mlc. 6:8; Matt. 24:14; Ps. 83:18; Prov. 22:15, and so forth.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 Timothy 3:15: “Infancy” can refer to a newborn (Luke 2:12) or a threemonth old (Acts 7:19, 20; Ex. 2:2). Point Is, start Immediately while child is still like young twig. Baby's brain reaches three quarters adult size by age two; heart doubles in size in first year. Important to reach heart.—Matt. 15:18; Luke 6:45.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">(2) Goal of training is in the way of God’s righteousness; must be done according to Bible standards, using Bible principles. Time and patience needed; also consistency from both parents, where possible, is Important. (Col. 3:21) Chairman should briefly recount demonstrations seen at convention or have audience relate what was remembered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Scene 1: Child speaks disrespectfully to parents In front of visiting adult. Some texts discussed were Prov. 23:22; 13:24 (obedience to parents required by God); Rom. 13:1 (disrespect of parental authority can lead to rebelliousness).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Scene 2: Child refuses to let a visiting child play with his toys, displaying selfish attitude. Texts used: Acts 20:35; Matt. 20:28 (Jesus’ own example); 1 Tim. 6:18 and 1 John 4:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Scene 3: Child throws tantrum when not allowed to take playthings to Kingdom Hall. Texts considered: Deut. 21:18 (self-will can lead to rebelliousness with serious consequence); Deut. 31:12 (even little ones to listen and learn at meetings); Prov. 22:15; 23:13, 14 (why physical rod of punishment may be necessary).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Basic course is to reason with child, showing undesirable outcome of bad course followed, using Scriptural principle to set things straight. Rod of discipline applied when and where necessary. Remember, goal is to raise Christian that will be loved by Jehovah and bring honor to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 mln: Song 24 and prayer. (Remind audience to read October 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">and bring it to next week's meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 mln: </span><span class="font12">Song 31, Announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 mln: </span><span class="font12">“Presenting the Good News— As Families, Using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span><span class="font12"> Question-and-answer discussion of article. When considering paragraph 3, ask audience for suggestions on talking points from October 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 mln: </span><span class="font12">Keeping Clean for the Service of God. Talk with audience participation. Carefully consider how the material applies In your area and focus on aspects needing attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In many areas there Is Increasing lack of concern about cleanness and appearance. What have you observed in your area? How is it affecting our brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bible's emphasis on spiritual cleanness (Lev. 19:1, 2; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16); also evidence that physical cleanness is Important. Customs of Israelites and early Christians marked them as clean people. For example, man’s leaving hair untended and garment unwashed considered signs of mourning. (2 Sam. 19:24) Hospitality Included washing feet of guests, likely dirty from walking on dusty roads In sandals. (Judg. 19:21; John 13:5) (If time permits, can consider other examples: Ex. 30: 17-21; Lev. 17:15; 15:13, and so forth.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God’s counsel &quot;YOU must be holy” applies to us today and shows importance of personal cleanness. Christians, as ministers, have good reasons for proper grooming and personal hygiene. If we are neat, clean and well-groomed, not gaudy or untidy. It will reflect well on message we bring and on the God we worship. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10) Children need to be Instructed on cleaning, handling clothes, eating habits, and so forth. Help them to realize It Is not just to aid mother, but is related to worshiping God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Christians also concerned about keeping home and possessions clean and orderly. Whole family should cooperate, for a clean and presentable home reflects on one’s worship. Cars and other equipment used In preaching work may also need attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Commendation Is due for vast 1m-firovement many have made since learn-ng truth. Encourage all to keep clean for service of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Elders can use this time to consider local needs or arrange to have several publishers relate experiences found on the last page of recent Issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Local experiences may also be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font12">Song </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font12">and closing prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Growing Spiritually as a Family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 63 and local announcements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">25 min: Showing Neighbor Love— Week by Week. Chairman* can handle Introductory part and then Include audience In discussion, emphasizing Bible principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(10 mln.) Throughout history man has functioned on weekly basis</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God’s work relative to earth done on weekly cycle of seven days (Gen. 2:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Israel observed seven-day cycle</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nearly all functions done weekly: shopping, washing, secular work, and so forth</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our worship also on weekly basis: five meetings per week</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How can we show love for others on weekly basis?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How would 1 Corinthians 13:8 apply to our preaching activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Schedule weekly service where possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Each one’s circumstances and responsibilities differ (2 Cor. 8:12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Everyone has 168 hours per week Showing neighbor love should receive high priority for Christian What are various opportunities for organized field service and group witnessing in local congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What are advantages of weekly service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Interview two or three congregation publishers of various ages who are exemplary and who share in service weekly</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When do they go out? Why do they consider </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">weekly</span><span class="font12"> service Important? What are the advantages of being out at least once each week?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(13 min.) Stimulating the Pioneer Spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many who publish weekly have pioneer spirit but cannot be regular pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Such appreciate opportunities to be auxiliary pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Appreciate need for whole-souled service (Col. 3:23, 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Circumstances of Individual dictate what is required to serve whole-souled (Gal. 6:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Auxiliary pioneer work is an aid in whole-souled service</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Interview several publishers with varying circumstances who find It possible to be auxiliary pioneers from time to time. Could Include housewife, older publisher, schoolage child, elder or ministerial servant, some who auxiliary pioneer during circuit overseer’s visit, or others. Stress how auxiliary pioneer arrangement suits circumstances of many</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Regular pioneers a blessing to congregation and community</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of best ways to show neighbor love week by week</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Increased service makes for increased results (2 Cor. 9:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Art of teaching” cultivated to greater degree (2 Tim. 4:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Interview, if possible, some who are presently pioneering or have pioneered in the past</span></p>

In fact, the original textbook used in the school said: “It is to the one end of making each one a more efficient Theocratic minister to the honor of the Lord’s name; that he may be better equipped to publicly present the hope that is with him.”—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> From time to time there have been minor changes in the format of the school. You will notice some changes in the school program for 1981 when you read through the instructions and schedule that accompany this issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font2"> What are some of these changes? For one thing, the Theocratic School will be 45 minutes in length. (See next month’s issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font2"> for further details.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>s</sup> The time allotted for Assignment No. 1 is being reduced from 20 minutes to 15 minutes. Otherwise this assignment, including the material being covered, remains basically the same as in the current school schedule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The 1981 schedule will allow eight minutes instead of six for highlights from the Bible reading assignment. This will allow more time for audience participation and thus all are endiuraged to keep up with the Bible reading schedule with a view to participating in the discussion. Talk No. 2 will be handled as it is now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Sisters will continue to be assigned to Talk No. 3, and this talk will still be based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.</span><span class="font2"> Talk No. 4, based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> articles, will preferably be assigned to a male student. It will be the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">last </span><span class="font2">talk on the program during 1981 and will be like Talk No. 5 on the current schedule.

Briefly outline offer of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> for contribution of $2.50. Discuss midweek and weekend field service arrangements. Include some experiences that will build appreciation for group activity. Also encourage all to spend some time in field service next Sunday, the first Sunday of November. Song 112 and prayer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• </span><span class="font2">gations the majority of the students are sisters and so Talk No. 4 may, at times, be assigned to a sister if desired. In this case the school overseer will assign an assistant as is currently done.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Also you will note that the new schedule sets out the number </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span class="font2">title of the opening song for each week’s program. This should prove helpful. Another change has to do with counsel. Sometimes the school overseer has had a difficult time getting all of the students together after the school in order to give private counsel. So, in 1981, counsel will again be given from the platform after each student talk. In this way the student and the entire congregation can benefit from the good, constructive counsel given. (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook, </span><span class="font2">p. 11.) No doubt the students will want to review the points of counsel that they will be working on when preparing for the school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> In order to prepare properly, each student should have his own copy of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</span><span class="font2"> which explains in detail all the points of counsel. The school overseer will, of course, base his counsel on this publication, taking into consideration the experience of each individual student in the Theocratic School.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> The value of the Theocratic School is summed up very well on page nine of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font2"> where it says: “This school provides free training for the ministry. It serves the congregation in two ways: (1) The individual student is given a program of study that helps him to improve in ability to gather, develop and present information logically to others; and (2) the entire congregation receives much valuable information in the course of each week’s program. Improved spiritual appreciation and ministerial activity are sure to result.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> We hope the new school arrangement for 1981 will help each Kingdom publisher to follow the inspired advice of the apostle Paul: “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to Goa, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font2"> Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As Families, Using “Awake!&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The two special issues of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> published this month are designed to deal with problems that confront a wide cross section of the people we meet in field service, pointing out Scriptural solutions. Have you read the magazines and thought about how to use them in the field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The October 8 issue develops the theme “How Can You Cope with Stress?” and the October 22 issue focuses on the theme “Does Life Have Any Meaning?” Truly, individuals and family groups everywhere are under tremendous pressure and stress every day—a modern epidemic! Where can relief be found, presently and permanently? On the other hand, many sincere persons are searching for the real meaning of life. Some, unfortunately, have accepted answers that have only brought more disappointment and sorrow. What can they do to make their fives meaningful? These captivating questions are just what some of the most timely articles in the two special issues deal with. What marvelous instruments we have in these two magazines to help those who are “skinned and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thrown</span><span class="font2"> about”!—Matt. 9:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> How fine it would be for each family to get together and go over these two magazines so that all can benefit personally from the fine information. Groups of publishers may do the same. As you do so, why not let each one present pick out something in the magazine —an article, an illustration, a caption, or a statement—that is especially appealing, and then help</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving Jehovah . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">dren in establishing magazine routes. This is very commendable! Yet, we do not want to overlook the possibility of starting Bible studies with these readers. A pioneer couple made it a goal to develop their magazine calls into Bible studies and reported: “It has been surprising to us how many have said yes, they would like a study.” So we encourage families to work together also in making return visits and conducting Bible studies. This way children can develop the fine art of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teaching</span><span class="font2"> the truth to others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Some families find it very enjoyable to work together in assisting other families to get into the field service. Such kind, Christian one another develop something to say for presenting it in the field. A little practice this way will polish up the presentations and everyone will be ready for a full share in offering the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> subscription,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Besides offering the subscription from house to house and to friends and acquaintances, be alert to other opportunities to make good use of these fine issues. When the householder is busy, or is on the wav out, or does not wish to take the subscription, why not briefly offer the two magazines? Street work is another good way to use these special magazines. By taking the initiative and approaching people, you can simply show them the magazine with the theme on the cover and ask if they would like to find out a little more about the matter. Then turn to an appropriate article and offer the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>0</sup> Some congregations have made a special effort to assist the younger publishers to have a full share in offering the magazines by making arrangements for field service during after-school hours, perhaps on Fridays. Good results have been reported, for it seems that generally more people are at home in the late afternoon, and the younger publishers usually enjoy offering the magazines, if they are well prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Let us, as families and as individuals, put to good use these two marvelous instruments, the October 8 and 22 special issues of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> Let the “armies of cavalry,” the symbolic “horses” of Revelation 9:16 go forth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">assistance is usually appreciated very much. One sister, the mother of seven young children, wrote: “I’m thankful to Jehovah and his earthly organization for having been helped to have a larger share in the work.” If you are part of a Christian family, small or large, can you find ways to encourage the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font2"> family to serve Jehovah together?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Family Bible reading is another means by which the whole family can be helped to grow spiritually. (Rom. 15:4) Surely each family needs such instructions in resisting the temptations and wicked influences in these perilous times. To bear out the truth in Paul’s statement, a high school counselor with a number of educational degrees said: “I discovered that the Bible’s counsel on such things as having a successful marriage, preventing juvenile delinquency and how to gain and keep friends is far superior to anything I had read or studied in college.” Parents who take the time to read the Bible with the family each day are also fulfilling the command given at Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Parents who are concerned about the spiritual growth of the family appreciate the importance of helping their children to get the most out of congregation meetings. To help their very young daughter benefit from the weekly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study, a couple noticed that there was usually a picture in each magazine by which she could remember what she had learned at the meeting. So they referred to these pictures and had many delightful discussions with her, even telling her bedtime stories thereby.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'When it comes to relaxation and entertainment, parents who are concerned about the spiritual development of the family will wisely guard against the insidious encroachment of the spirit of the world. For example, many family members admit that they feel farther apart when they spend too much time viewing television. Some even say that television is the main cause of the communication gap that exists in many families. Interestingly, some families have set aside certain “NO TV” evenings for family discussions, reading, or other types of recreation that involve the entire family, and have found the family atmosphere greatly improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>T</sup> It surely is a course of wisdom to follow Bible guidelines to keep our families united in these “critical days.” This contributes toward family happiness. A happy, united family ascribes glory and strength to its Founder, Jehovah God.—Ps. 96:7.</span></p>

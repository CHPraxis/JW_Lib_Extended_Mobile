<p><span class="font3">A Message of Hope!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Inflation! Sickness! Crime! War! What can mankind do about these things? How much longer will we have to suffer? Is there any reason to hope for better times? Questions like these are being asked by people all over the world. Because of having no hope, many despair. “Expectation postponed is making the heart sick,” is the way the wise man expressed it at Proverbs 13:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The Bible tells us that these things are to take place in the last days. (Rev. 6:1-8) And it foretells from what source relief will come. People are looking to man’s government for help. Or they look to astrologers or fortune-tellers. Some look to the scientists. But none can be sure of lasting relief from these sources. Thankfully, we know that the only place to look for sure help is the kingdom of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A NEW TRACT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The tract for September has as its title “HOPE FOR ENDING INFLATION, SICKNESS, CRIME, WAR?” It will surely bring a message of hope to sincere people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The tract points to the Bible as the only book in which man can securely put his hope. It shows that the very existence of man’s problems is a basis for hope. (See</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Courageous and Strong</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The days we live in are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">difficult, referred to</span><span class="font4"> in Scripture as the ‘time of the end.’ Yet there is much to be done in the work of public preaching and disciplemaking. Those who would share fully in this work must be courageous and strong. The example of Joshua can help us in this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah said to Joshua: “Be courageous and very strong to take care to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it to the right or to the left, in order that you may act wisely everywhere you go.” Again he said: “Be courageous and strong. Do not suffer shock or be terrified, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” All of us, young members of the congregation as well as adults, need to be like Joshua.—Josh. 1:7, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> One does not become courageous and strong overnight. It takes—</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME, EFFORT AND JEHOVAH’S HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Joshua was Moses’ attendant Luke 21:28.) The third page illustrates that inflation will not only be controlled, but will be completely done away with. (Ps. 72:16) Sickness will cease. (Rev. 21:4) Crime will end. (Ps. 37:10) War will be no more. (Ps. 46:9) All the grand things that the Bible tells us about will be realized in this generation and be enjoyed by people right here on the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> How can we help people to know of this sure hope? One way is by presenting the new tract with enthusiasm and conviction. During the month of September we all will have an opportunity to do this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PRESENT THE TRACT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Many brothers have expressed appreciation for opportunities to talk to people at length concerning the contents of previous tracts. We encourage you to do this whenever possible. Since the tract offer is one of the easiest to present, many who have never shared in witnessing before may want to start. Encourage them to do so if they qualify. What about Memorial attenders we have been assisting? Would some of them qualify to share in this activity during the month? Could some be reactivated?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">and minister. He was blessed in many ways by working closely with Moses. You, too, can benefit by working with other, perhaps older, brothers in the congregation. Make known your willingness to help. Then don’t wait to be asked, but pitch in and help when you see them doing work around the Kingdom Hall, going in field service or rendering personal assistance to another person. It takes courage and strength to do this, but the blessings you will enjoy are many.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It often calls for courage and strength to stick to a job until it is finished. Apparently, Joshua faithfully remained for 40 days at the base of the mountain when Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the commandments of God. (Ex. 24:12-15; 32:15-17) Are you, too, willing to stick to your theocratic assignments, even when they may take longer than you expected?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Admittedly, it takes courage and strength to stand up for Jehovah and the truth when others </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

Also, arrange in advance to interview one or two of the younger members of the congregation concerning occasions when they have had to be courageous and strong in harmony with any of the points in the article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">8 mln: </span><span class="font13">Song 73 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">15 min: The offer for October: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">subscription for a contribution of $2.50. The theme of the October 8 Issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> is &quot;How Can You Cope with Stress?” Have experienced publisher or pioneer demonstrate following presentation. After asking the householder what some of the things are that cause stress, direct the conversation to the current Topic for Conversation, “Rea-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be Courageous and Strong </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font4">oppose. Do you put forth the effort to do this? It was not easy for Joshua or Caleb to stand alone when 10 others disagreed with the position of faith they took. And it was not easy for them to remain faithful when the majority of those who heard their report rejected it and threatened to stone them to death. Nevertheless, Joshua and Caleb stood firm because they were sure that Jehovah would protect them, as well as all of his faithful people.—Num. 13:30, 31; 14:6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Many young members of the congregation will be returning to school this month. If you are one of these, you may face opposers who do not agree with you, just as Joshua did. When you are ridiculed or threatened because of your faith and your bold Christian stand, will you remain firm and continue to walk in Christian integrity? Will you also continue to show courage and reliance on Jehovah by boldly declaring the good news from house to house, as well as on other appropriate occasions? Admittedly, such courage and Christian faith calls for dependence on Jehovah.—Ps. 118:6; 55:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> Because Joshua and Caleb had confidence that Jehovah would care for them, and because they followed his direction in faith, Jehovah said: “They have followed </span><span class="font13">son and Remedy for World Woes.” Draw the attention of the householder to Revelation 12:12 and Romans 16:20, getting his comments on what these scriptures say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A second brief demonstration can feature an article from magazine that appeals to the publisher, who expresses conviction that householder will be equally impressed with the practical information presented. Ask audience for their observations on effective points of the presentation or different articles they plan to feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Encourage all to keep presentations simple and uncomplicated, showing householders practical value of information in the magazines. Several Issues of the magazine can be displayed to help householder see value of the subscription. Encourage the offering of subscriptions in house-to-house work, informal witnessing, when making return visits, and the offering of single issues if the subscription offer is not accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: &quot;Presenting the Good News— On the First Sunday of the Month.” Questions and answers. Also include any encouraging experiences or expressions from local publishers concerning their work on the first Sunday of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Song 89 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah wholly.” (Num. 32:12) Do you have that kind of faith and courage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Joshua resolved: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” (Josh. 24:15) All of us, young members of the congregation as well as adults, should personally put forth the effort to be like Joshua. Always pray for Jehovah’s help. With his blessing we can be courageous and strong and serve in a way that brings honor to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Become Their Prey!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” (2 Tim. 3:13) So warn the Scriptures. And these impostors are trying not only to mislead in doctrinal matters but also to take advantage of the generosity of faithful brothers in a material way. From time to time notices have appeared in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font4"> giving warning of these deceivers, but the Society continues to receive reports of brothers being defrauded of money and material things because of believing the “hard-times” story of traveling impostors. Often their story is that they are stranded and need $50 or more to get gasoline and food for returning to their home. In most cases they are not Jehovah’s Witnesses at all but are only pretending to be.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Loving Provision from Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> It was a midwinter day and the temperature was below zero. A Christian mother started out on foot, along with four of her children, walking an eight-mile journey to the Kingdom Hall. After they walked three miles, a neighbor stopped in an auto and gave them a ride for the remaining five miles. In the Congo, a youth 17 years of age walks nine miles to attend meetings. In Honduras each Sunday a group of new Witnesses walks three hours to get to the meetings, and three hours to get back home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Why would so many individuals go to so much trouble to attend congregation meetings? Because they appreciate the privilege of associating with fellow Christians for worship and study of God’s Word.—Matt. 5:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jesus’ disciples appreciated the importance of regularly receiving spiritual encouragement, especially when meeting together. (See Acts 2:42, 46; 19:8, 9; 20:8; Rom. 16:3, 5; Philem. 2.) And the apostle Paul wrote: “We ought to see how each of us may best arouse others to love and active goodness, not staying sway from our meetings, as some do, but rather encouraging one another, all the more because you see the Day drawing near.” —Heb. 10:24, 25, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NEB.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Meetings are a loving provision from our heavenly Father, Jehovah. All of them are arranged with the purpose of encouraging us to manifest love in all aspects of life and to abound in fine works.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> How can we show appreciation for these Christian meetings? By attending regularly! Since all of us want to keep our integrity to Jehovah, we must be conscious of our spiritual needs. Congregation meetings are truly precious to us. —Ps. 26:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> During coming months more will be said in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font4"> about other aspects of congregation meetings. These articles should build up our appreciation for the meetings as loving provisions that Jehovah has made for us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Since congregation meetings are an arrangement by Jehovah, how should we dress when we come? The Bible counsels us to dress at all times with modesty. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10; 1 Pet. 3:3-6) It is good to remember that we are presenting ourselves before the Sovereign of the universe for instruction. So it is not a casual occasion. It is good if our appearance reflects the dignity of the occasion. In this way we will not offend God or our brothers. And this would apply to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> congregation meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Being punctual at our congregation meetings shows that we respect our host, Jehovah God, for this loving arrangement. Missing the first few minutes of a congregation meeting is like picking up an article to read and starting with the fourth or fifth paragraph. We miss the introduction and perhaps the setting. Our overall understanding and enjoyment are lessened. More seriously, we miss joining in the opening petition in prayer to Jehovah. It is good when elders and ministerial servants arrive early at meetings. They then have an opportunity to greet other brothers warmly and to welcome them to the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Showing appreciation for congregation meetings as a loving arrangement from Jehovah will result in great happiness and many blessings, both now and in the coming system of things.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>New Literature Prices</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Well has it been observed that ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses have covered the earth with their witnessing.’ How has this been made possible? Not by human might or power, but by God’s spirit operating upon his servants as they have made use of various provisions to fulfill their preaching and teaching commission.—Zech. 4:6; Matt. 24:14; 28: 19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> One of the most effective means used to accomplish our work has been the use of the printed page. Over the years billions of pieces of Bible literature in the form of books, booklets, magazines, tracts, and so forth, have been distributed to make known the Kingdom good news. Last year alone a total of 253,727,225 books, booklets and magazines were distributed world wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> All over the world economic conditions are very unstable at the present time. Due to soaring inflation, the cost of living continues to rise. So does the cost of printing materials, paper, shipping and mailing. This affects the Society’s operations not only at Brooklyn but at all of our printing branches. In many countries it is necessary to subsidize the printing of publications. Hence, each year the Society must review the current situation as part of its planning for the future and then make adjustments accordingly.—Luke 14: 28-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Now that a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List</span><span class="font4"> has been prepared, we would like to have brothers keep the above points in mind when they consider the new pricing arrangement. Four copies of the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List </span><span class="font4">are being sent to each congregation. One copy is for the secretary. The other three copies should be given to the brothers caring for literature, magazines and accounts.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In making the changes set out in the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List,</span><span class="font4"> the Society has taken into consideration the information received from all the branches. In order to care for the rising costs in many countries, including those in the United States, it has been necessary to increase the price of our literature. You will note that the congregation and public rate will be the same. This will help reduce some of the bookkeeping work. These new prices and rates will go into effect as of September 1, 1980. After the actual count of literature is taken, each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font4"> 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On the First Sunday of the Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Do you have a regular share in the work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making? (Matt. 24: 14; 28:19, 20) Many have been aided to share with others in this work on the first Sunday of the month as well as at other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> When the announcement is made in the congregation that “This coming Sunday will be the first Sunday of the month . . . ” and field service arrangements are outlined, reports indicate that the response and support have been very encouraging. Many put forth a special effort to share in the house-to-house work on that day. Brothers have often made adjustments so that other matters do not interfere with arrangements to share with the rest of the congregation in this special activity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> One elder said concerning himself and his wife: “We make it our business to share in the house-to-house work with other publishers on that Sunday for sure, and on other weekends as we are able.” Many publishers who were not participating in house-to-house work on Sunday are now doing so consistently.—Acts 20:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> It affords a wonderful opportunity for parents to work with their children. One father said: “This arrangement helps us to keep a good schedule for field service.” Another said: “If our family finds it necessary to be away from the congregation on a weekend, we try to arrange things so that it is not the first weekend of the month. Jesus said ‘Seek first the kingdom,’ so we try to put field service in the first place each month.”—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> One sister, with an unbelieving husband, who was not permitted to share in the service on weekends got a pleasant surprise. She told her husband of the Society’s suggestion that Jehovah’s people share in the witness work on at least the first Sunday of the month. He said: “That’s fine. You can go out the first Sunday of the month and I’ll sleep late that morning.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER BENEFITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Elders and other publishers have been delighted that they have had opportunity to work with some they were not able to work with on other occasions. Many are encouraged by seeing others in the work. One brother said: “There is a special joy in knowing so many are working together in a united way.” A sister who had not normally been sharing in the work on Sunday came back rejoicing that she had started the Bible study that she had been praying for.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Many congregations have reported very good support of the special field service arrangements for the first Sunday of each month. Some have had close to 100 percent support. Regular reminders from the platform and personal invitations during the week before encourage many to share. Good support by the elders and ministerial servants is vital.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Are you out in field service with the group on the first Sunday of the month? Could you arrange your affairs so that this might be possible? If you can, we encourage you to do so.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">If someone you do not know comes to you and says he is in need, it is wise to find out something about this person, and usually this can best be done by the elders. Genuineness often can be detected by discussing how long he has been in the truth, asking if he was at a recent assembly, seeing how familiar he is with recent publications, and so forth. Invariably you will find that it is advisable to ask for the name of one of the elders in his congregation so that you might call and get a recommendation. Bona fide brothers and sisters who find themselves unexpectedly in need should not object to this inquiry for the protection of all concerned. A telephone call should be made. Impostors will thus be exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Usually it is not sufficient merely to accept the person’s word that he .knows the name of an overseer in a particular town. In traveling, these deceivers sometimes learn the names of brothers and the congregations with which they are associated. While their story may sound very sincere, check it out first. Do not become their prey!</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Are You Proving What Your Own Work Is?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The human body is marvelously designed to work. And what a variety of work it is capable of performing! Have you not wondered at how the eyes, the hands, the nerves, ligaments and muscles all function harmoniously when you swing a hammer at a nail, sew with a needle and thread or write a word with a pen? The cooperation of body parts is so smooth, so complete in carrying out each command sent out by our remarkable brain!—Ps. 139:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Paul uses the human body as an illustration of how the Christian congregation should perform its God-given work assignment. In 1 Corinthians, chapter 12, Paul likens each one in the congregation to a member of Christ’s body. He highlights the love, unity and cooperation among them as they work at preaching the good news and make disciples of Jesus Christ, the head of the congregation. (1 Cor. 12:12) Although one body organ may perform a function different from another, each nevertheless makes a contribution to what the body as a whole is doing. (Rom. 12:4-8) We may take Christ’s spiritual body as an illustration for us to follow today.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Served as a Pioneer in the Past?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> In the United States alone there are on record the names of some 75,000 publishers who have served as regular pioneers in the past, but who are not pioneering at present! Are you one of them? If so, we venture to say that you look back on that time as one of the happiest periods of your life. Do you recall what a pleasure it was to speak with people about Jehovah and his kingdom almost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every day</span><span class="font2"> in field service? Do you recall the feeling you had </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">frequently</span><span class="font2"> as you saw the faces of interested persons light up in response to your explanation of Kingdom blessings? Do you recall, too, how skilled you had become in your use of the Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> It is true that you still experience those joys as a congregation publisher, but probably not to the extent you did as a pioneer. Jesus said: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit.” The full-time service truly offers abundant opportunity to ‘bear </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">much</span><span class="font2"> fruit.’—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTEEM YOUR PRIVILEGE OF SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> What is your sphere of activity within the Christian congregation? Whatever it is, do you esteem it highly? Jehovah does! You may feel at times that you are a “weaker” one or that the part you Elay in the congregation is a “less onorable” one. Limitations caused by poor health, age or other circumstances may cause you to feel this way. Whatever the case, it is good to view matters as Jehovah does. His Word tells us: “But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary, and the parts ... we think to be less honorable, these we surround with more abundant honor. . . . Nevertheless, God compounded the body, giving honor more abundant to the part which had a lack.”—1 Cor. 12:22-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Viewing matters from this standpoint, all of us can work whole-souled in spite of our limitations, knowing that Jehovah makes up for any lack we may have. The point is, are our efforts contributing to the great preaching and teaching work now being accomplished by God’s con-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE PIONEERS NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Has the need for pioneers lessened since you left the ranks? To the contrary! The quickening pace of events calls for more and more workers as the end of this system approaches. It reminds us of what happens when men harvesting a field of grain see a heavy rainstorm approaching over the horizon. As the lightning flashes and the thunder claps, they work feverishly to get the crop in before the storm strikes. Jesus said: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few.” (Matt. 9:37) As the storm of the “great tribulation” approaches, over 113,000 persons responded to the work of the harvesters and got baptized last year! Does that not add emphasis to Jesus’ words!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> How many more honest-hearted persons will respond to our message and learn God’s righteous requirements for survival? We do not know. But Jehovah is still drawing honest-hearted people to himself, and as he does, we have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Was it economic circumstances that necessitated your giving up the full-time pioneer service? It is not difficult to understand how this could happen under the pressures of the present system. It may have been family responsibilities that interrupted your pioneer work. If so, that would certainly take priority over full-time service if you are not in a position to accommodate both. Many have left the pioneer ranks due to health problems, and, of course, there are other important reasons why some have had to give up this joyous privilege of service. But circumstances do change. Has this been true in your case?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN YOU RETURN?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Rarely does one stop pioneering because he wants to. Changes in circumstances cause an interruption of his joyful, full-time service. Was that not true in your case? But on the other hand, are the circumstances that caused you to leave the pioneer ranks still an obstacle? If so, we know you will continue rendering whatever service you can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> If you left the pioneer service for economic reasons, have you examined your situation recently and considered the possibility of reentering the full-time service? You will no doubt recall that it took a considerable measure of self-sacrifice and determination for you to enter the pioneer work the first time. Could you make that same noble effort work again?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Was it family responsibility that took you out of the pioneer work? Or did you leave because of problems with your health? Were there perhaps other problems of a personal nature? Remembering your life as a pioneer and reflecting on the joys it brought should keep you alert to recognize any change of circumstances that would make it possible for you to pioneer again. If you have kept the pioneer spirit alive, no doubt you continue to work for a change in your personal circumstances that will open the way to resume pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Pioneering may have to stop temporarily due to any number of problems as we have already indicated, but that does not mean the pioneer spirit is lost. One sister</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Youth-Ward Off Calamity!—Ecd. 11:10</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> What makes a person happy and fulfilled? Why, pleasing our heavenly Father, of course! As a young person there is no better time to think seriously about your Creator than now, in the prime of your life. Why? Read what Solomon says at Ecclesiastes 11:10 and 12:1. You will see that the ability to do things wanes during the “calamitous days” of old age.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> “But what does Jehovah want of me?” you might ask. Some young people feel that God takes a rigid, hard, perhaps even negative view of youthful interests and enthusiasms. They may feel that serving God keeps them from having a good time. But is this really true? Obviously not, especially when we consider such texts as Ecclesiastes 11:9, Proverbs 27:11 and Psalm 103:5. Nevertheless, you need to keep in mind that we are all responsible to Jehovah for our actions. Though allowing freedom of choice, Jehovah will not shield you from the frustration and bitter consequences of pursuing a wrongful course. If you play with fire, you get burned. (Compare Proverbs 6:27, 28.) Yet, by avoiding a reckless, debauched or even a selfish way of life, you can escape all kinds of problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Do you know persons your own age who are involved in crime, immorality or violence? Are they happy? Do you think they are pleasing Jehovah? In contrast, is it not apparent that young people who are doing Jehovah’s will enjoy more secure and happy lives? You might answer, “Yes, but that’s easier said than done.” True, but many are successfully ‘warding off calamity’ by setting wholesome goals in life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Many, for example, engage in the auxiliary pioneer service from has had to leave the regular pioneer work twice, but is now back on the list for the third time. She stopped the first time for health reasons and the second time because of her child’s health. After those problems were resolved and the child started to school, the sister wrote: “I seriously started thinking of pioneering again.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Then, too, there is the auxiliary pioneer service that you may share in as your circumstances permit. One sister wrote: “May I take a moment to thank you for the auxiliary pioneer arrangement. I feel this is truly a provision from Jehovah for many who are in my situation. I regularly pioneered in the forties and fifties. Then chil-time to time. Have you tried it? If not, why not discuss with your parents and with the elders the possibility of entering the auxiliary pioneer service this summer? They would no doubt be delighted to help you. The benefits? (1) You will be pleasing Jehovah. (2) You will be using His Word, getting more acquainted with it. (3) You will learn to lean upon Jehovah in prayer, looking to him for results. (4) By giving of yourself in this way, your happiness will be increased. (5) It will give you opportunity to work closely with other zealous ones, cultivating lasting and upbuilding friendships. (6) Finally, whatever you do later in life, you will more likely succeed because of your improved spiritual outlook.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Are you thinking about what you will do when you graduate from school? Have you set any goals for yourself? Maybe you’d like to be successful at a particular secular job. Or you may even be thinking of marriage and having a family. While these goals are not wrong in themselves, would they really allow God the first place in your life? Have you seriously considered going into the regular pioneer work and possibly serving Jehovah in some foreign field as a missionary? Or what about helping us here at Bethel with the production of Bible literature? These are wholesome, worthwhile goals. Work toward the fulfillment of them, ward off calamity, and experience the joys of full-time service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Of course, no one should be forced into doing something against his will. But think of what Solomon wrote under inspiration, that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font2"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">dren came along and I was unable to continue. But since the auxiliary arrangement, I have been able to have a regular part.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> Have you noticed that the number of regular pioneers has increased rapidly, especially during the past year and a half? Much of this increase has come from the return of former pioneers to the pioneer ranks. Do you at times long to return to that joyful work that brought you so much satisfaction in the past? Why not think it over? Take the matter to Jehovah in prayer. Give careful </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thought to</span><span class="font2"> your circumstances as they are now. If you are in a position to reenter the full-time service, why not send us your application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Righteous-hearted, kindhearted, openhearted, good-hearted—expressions such as these are often used to describe individuals with whom we may speak about God’s kingdom and the blessings it will bring. But often in our preaching and teaching activity we have also found persons that appeared to have a bad condition of heart. And then something happened to bring about a change in their heart condition. What may serve to help change a person’s heart condition?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> At times it may be that our kind and warm approach serves as a strong influence. Knowing that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, Jehovah’s people continually make efforts to speak forth words of comfort and wisdom. (Luke 6:45) Their hearts overflow with a desire to share what is good with their neighbors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> When we speak to others, do we reflect what is in our heart? There are many things involved. One is our sincerity in showing we really are interested in those to whom we are speaking. Another is the conviction we convey that we indeed believe that what God says in his Word is true. Still another is the way we make our presentation of the message. By speaking from the heart we do not give our message by rote, as though it were a recorded announcement. No, we sincerely try to talk to the people from our heart. Do we have help in this regard? Consider the following:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Each month in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font2"> we have a Topic for Conversation. This suggests that we should not just </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">talk</span><span class="font2"> to an individual, but as in true conversation also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">listen</span><span class="font2"> to what the other person has to say. This proves to be a far better way to get a heart-motivated response. It means his view, or argument, is given consideration as we seek to give an answer for the hope within us. —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> You may say: “But it is so difficult for me to strike up a conversation, for example, in the door-to-door work or in informal witnessing. I almost need to memorize what I will say, as otherwise I forget, and if I let the householder say something, it throws off my whole line of reasoning and I am lost.” Do you feel that way at times?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> For some, a brief word outline is of help. Note this brief topic for conversation: “Hello! Have you ever wondered if there is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">remedy</span><span class="font2"> for the world’s woes? [Listen to response.] The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bible foretold</span><span class="font2"> today’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">problems</span><span class="font2"> and the cause. [Read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation 12:12.) </span><span class="font2">Did you note the one causing the problems? [Listen to response.] That short period of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">time is about up</span><span class="font2"> and will be followed by everlasting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">peace. Romans 16:20</span><span class="font2"> is comforting in this regard. [Read.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Did you note the italicized words above? Perhaps with just those words to prompt you, you can start off a conversation with a householder. Of course, after you read the last scripture, the interest shown will help you to determine how much further to carry the conversation. You may draw the person out in further discussion or go right into the literature offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Bearing in mind the words of the proverb that “Jehovah is making an estimate of hearts,” may our heart be shown to be righteous, kind and well-motivated as we present the good news. We can confidently leave the results to Jehovah.—Prov. 21:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Youth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“youth and the prime of life are vanity.” What lesson does that convey? Simply this: A person does not always remain young. Likewise, the joys and advantages of youthful strength and vigor are uncertain as to their duration. Even young people get sick and die. The youth who ignores this fact may fail to make wise use of what he has, dissipating his physical energies and capabilities in a way of life that can make his adult years more difficult. That is obviously why Solomon wrote what he did at Ecclesiastes 12:1, 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Why not give serious thought to these matters? Discuss them with your parents or with a mature Christian friend. It is up to you to ‘ward off calamity’ in your life. We are confident that you will if you are determined to take a course of action that gives evidence of strong faith and a deep love of our Grand Creator.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">• We have been asked by a number of congregations how to obtain the Federal Identification Number now required. This can be done by obtaining an SS-4 form from the Internal Revenue Service office, filling it out according to the facts and mailing It to the local Internal Revenue </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Center.</span><span class="font13"> The address can be obtained when you obtain the form.

The congregation number should now be shown on the front of the card. The back of the card should be filled out when a pioneer changes name due to change in marital status, and so forth. Notation should also be made on the back of the card when a pioneer moves to a different congregation and needs to be reassigned. Space Is still provided for a brief explanation when a pioneer falls short of the 90 hours for the month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Yes, the human body is marvelously designed to work. The same is true of the worldwide Christian congregation. As each one in it—each hand, nerve, ligament and muscle, as it were— proves what its own work is, this beautifully coordinated congregation will give a tremendous witness under the headship of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">gregation? We want our work to be for a “beneficial purpose,” and never disrupt what the “body,” the congregation, is working to accomplish.—Compare 1 Corinthians 12:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CAUSE FOR EXULTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> So God is pleased to use us as his fellow workers and he does not compare us with one another in what we do. Rather, he lets each one “prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.” (Gal. 6:4) There is an interaction and a coordination between our body parts. One may perform a function that another cannot. Even so, there is an interdependency. One does not work against the other. How beautifully this illustrates the Christian congregation as each one operates within his sphere of activity under the direction of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Are you personally proving that your work unites with that of all the rest of the congregation so that Jehovah’s name is honored? If so, you have “cause for exultation.” Something that has united all the operations of the body of God’s people for more than 100 years is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> During July the literature offer will be a subscription to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Enthusiastically present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription when you engage in the house-to-house work. Also, look for opportunities to informally offer it to workmates, schoolmates, neighbors, salesmen or others. You may have the privilege to be among those who will be offering it as they spend 90 or more hours in the pioneer work. Some who are perhaps infirm or elderly may be able to spend a few hours engaging in street wit-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>

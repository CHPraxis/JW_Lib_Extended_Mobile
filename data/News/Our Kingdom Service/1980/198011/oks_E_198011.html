<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How delighted we are to have the new book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness—How to Find It.</span><span class="font11"> Many quickly read through this new publication shortly after receiving it, but in order for all to get a firm grasp on this excellent information about true happiness and how to find it, a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Dependability— A Mark of Faithfulness!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We all depend on many things in life. We need food ana water, and air to breathe. We are thankful for friends or family we can depend on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But most of all we are dependent on Jehovah, as He is the Life-Giver. We have come to appreciate also that it is through the <sup>r</sup>‘faithful and discreet slave’<sup>r</sup> class that Jehovah provides us with spiritual food “at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45-47) We are glad Jehovah has built up an organization of faithful servants throughout the earth who are willing to shoulder the load of directing the Kingdom interests in 97 branch offices and who work hard to print and distribute the spiritual food through this organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFUL EXAMPLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> As we examine the Bible record we find examples of many men and women who were dependable and showed their faithfulness to Jehovah. Think of Moses. Remember the many ways he showed both his faith and dependability in Jehovah’s service. (Heb. 11:27-29)</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">Congregation Meetings-Part I</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How important are congregation meetings to you? How important is it to Jehovah that his people congregate before him regularly? Is your view of the meetings the same as his? He tells us how he feels about this aspect of our worship at Deuteronomy 4:10. (Read.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah directed those meetings through his holy angels. But today he is dealing with us through his mighty archangel enthroned at his right side. “That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us. . . . For if the word spoken through angels proved to be firm . . . how shall we escape if we have neglected a salvation of such greatness in that it began to be spoken through our Lord?” (Heb. 2:1-4) When we view our divine instruction from this lofty plane, it is little wonder that Paul later in this same letter said what he did at Hebrews 10:25. (Read.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM ADJUSTMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Starting in January a slight change is being made in the length of the Theocratic School and service meeting. Each of the two meetings will be 45 minutes in length, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not including the songs and prayers.</span><span class="font11"> This may help some elders Did not he and his brother Aaron return to Pharaoh time after time with the message that Jehovah commanded until they finally were told to appear no more on pain of death? (Ex. 10:11, 28) Was he not faithful in overseeing the building of the tabernacle just as Jehovah directed? And did not Moses faithfully stand before the people to judge them until Jehovah showed the way to give him assistance? —Ex. 18:13, 25, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Others we could point to as examples of dependability are Mark ana Timothy. Although John Mark at one time turned back from accompanying his brothers on an evangelizing trip, thus raising questions about his dependability, he later showed himself to be both useful and dependable, even being privileged later to write one of the Gospels.—Acts 13:13; 2 Tim. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Timothy also, though a young man, zealously followed the directions given him by his older brother Paul in carrying on the preaching work.—2 Cor. 1:18-20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and ministerial servants who need a little more time to care for their duties and responsibilities after these meetings. Others may find it helpful if they depend on public transportation. (Please see announcement on page 3 regarding arrangement for these meetings when circuit overseer visits congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ With these meetings being somewhat shorter, each of us will want to be better prepared to realize the greatest possible spiritual benefits. Elders in particular will be conscious of their teaching so all go away edified. The Sermon on the Mount was a short meeting, but what powerful teaching was demonstrated in that little time! Do you and your family have a set time to go over the material to be covered in these meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPORT CONGREGATION MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>s</sup>CONGREGATION BOOK STUDY:</span><span class="font11"> In January we will start studying the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.</span><span class="font11"> This 416-page book, published in 1973, contains vital information that is even more apropos now than when it was</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">series of eight talks will be presented during January and February, 1981. The titles for these talks are set out below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Similar to last year’s arrangements, there will be no outlines provided for these talks. This is the only notice that congregations will receive on this matter. Each congregation should immediately make definite arrangements for this series to be presented. Qualified speakers should be assigned talks and in some cases capable ministerial servants may be used if needed. Since some congregations may have a limited number of capable speakers, neighboring congregations may wish to stagger the starting date of the series of talks, one beginning January 4 and the other on January 11. Thus, even with a limited number of qualified speakers, the same brother could give the same talk in each congregation and the sequence would </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">be </span><span class="font11">maintained in the order as listed above.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What did Jesus mean by the words “shake the dust off your feet”? Just before saying this he gave detailed instructions as to what the disciples should and should not do or take with them in the preaching work. Then he spoke the words recorded at Matthew 10:11-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> First, they were to search out those who were “deserving.” But how were the disciples to treat those who did not receive them favorably? Jesus told them to ‘shake the dust off their feet’ and go on their way. This means that they would get on with their work of declaring the “good news” and not waste time in angry disputes that would only irritate the householder and rob the disciple of his peace and joy.—Matt. 10:13; Acts 13:50-52.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In Luke 9:5 Jesus said to “shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.” Our role is to provide a witness about the Kingdom and to warn people of impending destruction at Armageddon. If our message is rejected, we peacefully depart, leaving that house or city to the consequences</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Meetings </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font11">first released. Think of the hundreds of thousands of new ones who have been baptized since it was first published. All of us, old or new in the faith, will benefit greatly from the spiritual “meat” contained in this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">• SERVICE MEETING:</span><span class="font11"> The service meeting is directly related to our preaching and disciplemaking work. The more field service oriented we are, the more meaningful this meeting will be to us. Some take notes on exceptional field points and other information gleaned from the meeting and then use them in the various features of their field service. Our work is twofold: We </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sound a warning</span><span class="font11"> as well as search for sheeplike ones. Future service meetings will reflect this additional reason for our preaching. Let the service meetings motivate you to increased sacred service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">’ THEOCRATIC SCHOOL:</span><span class="font11"> As mentioned last month in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font11"> the school has been revised for 1981. All will benefit from the counsel that will be given following the student talks and each student will have better in mind just where he needs to improve. This is helpful even to those in the audience who will be giving talks in the future as they may that will come by Jehovah’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BE MILD-TEMPERED AND RESPECTFUL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Peter wrote: “But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) These words reveal the mental attitude we should have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The following experience shows the wisdom of pursuing peace and not retaliating. “A young brother and I walked up a driveway to call on a home while working house to house one morning. When we were about half way up the driveway, the man of the house burst out of the front door yelling for us to get off his property and telling us that he wanted nothing of what we had. The boy and I stood motionless until he had finished and we turned and walked back to the street without making any reply whatsoever. We went across the street and talked to a woman for some time, possibly a half hour.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">need to improve along the same line. The school will be reduced to a total of four talks each week to accommodate the shorter meeting. With a total of eight minutes to be used for discussion of the Bible reading assignment, this important aspect of the school will receive added emphasis. This is truly a time when Jehovah congregates his people together that they may hear his words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;WATCHTOWER” STUDY: </span><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study could be likened to the main entree of a finely prepared, five-course meal. It contains the solid food we all need to withstand trials and pressures. Are there any who are not experiencing such? Who then can afford to miss even one </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">study? Remember, neglecting our spirituality intensifies most problems! Remain firm in the faith. Attend regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">»PUBLIC TALK:</span><span class="font11"> The Society plans to provide some new public talk outlines in March for those who are used as public speakers in the congregations. These will provide fresh information in line with the needs of God’s people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">© The August Issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font10"> on page 4 outlined that during the circuit overseer’s visit there would be an adjustment in the Theocratic School and service meeting. This adjustment remains In effect except that Assignment No. 1 will be 15 minutes in length, rather than 20 as formerly, ana the highlights from the Bible reading for the week will be 8 minutes In length, rather than 6, as formerly. There will be no student talks that week. Thus with the circuit overseer’s one-half hour talk and the regular service meeting conducted for 45 minutes, the whole program. Including songs and prayers, should not exceed about one hour and 55 minutes, beginning January 1, 1981.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With “My Book of Bible Stories&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Only watch out for yourself . . . that you may not forget the things that your eyes have seen and that they may not depart from your heart all the days of your life; and you must make them known to your sons and to your grandsons.” (Deut. 4:9) With those words, Jehovah was preparing his people to enter into the Promised Land. Yes, it was not only important for the adults ‘not to forget the things’ Jehovah had done, hut also important that the sons and grandsons be taught. Is it any different today as we stand at the threshold of a far grander Promised Land, God’s new order?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What a marvelous instrument Jehovah has provided to help us ‘watch out for ourselves’ and also to use in teaching our ‘sons and grandsons.’ We speak of Afy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Bible Stories,</span><span class="font11"> now printed in 35 languages. The stories of what Jehovah has done in the past must not depart from the hearts of our children all the days of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Many have said that this book is the easiest one to offer of any we have ever had. Perhaps that is why it has reached the remarkable circulation figure of over 13 million copies in just two years. Obviously many who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses are interested in giving spiritual help to their sons and grandsons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We can assist them by presenting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> in field service during November. What have you found to be the best way to present it? While it is true that we are placing an attractive book on a remarkably low contribution, we do not want that to be the chief aspect of our presentation, do we? We want to highlight the spiritual benefits of the offer. How can we accomplish this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Our Topic for Conversation shows two basic reasons why the Bible was written, namely (1) to sound a warning and (2) to make you wise for salvation. You might say: “Hello, we are calling today to help people understand why the Bible was written. Have you ever wondered about that? [Allow response.] One reason that some are not aware of is to sound a warning. That is the thought expressed here at 1 Corinthians 10: 11. [Read.] God’s warnings are not to frighten but to move people to seek salvation, a second reason why the Bible was written. Second Timothy 3:15 helps us to appreciate that young and old alike need the Holy Writings for salvation. [Read.] Let me show you an example of the happy salvation foretold by one Bible writer, Isaiah, here in one of the stories in this book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.”</span><span class="font11"> Turn to Story 71 and read first and last paragraphs. Offer the book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> You may encounter some who already have the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories </span><span class="font11">book. What then? Why not offer to study it with them and the family? There is also the possibility of placing some other appropriate Bible study aid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Have you thought of offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> book to people on the street? Many have and some have had fine results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Let all of us assist others during November to know why the Bible was written by offering </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font11"> on a contribution of $2.50.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Shake the Dust ...&quot; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d.) </span><span class="font11">When we came out from her house, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">previously violent</span><span class="font11"> man was standing at the end of his driveway waiting for us. We expected another tirade. Instead, he had regained his composure, was very mild and apologized for the way he had spoken to us. We feel this sudden change in his attitude was due to the fact that we did not retaliate.”—Rom. 12:17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• <a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">2</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark10">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark11">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark12">5</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote6"></a><a href="#bookmark13">6</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#bookmark14">7</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote8"></a><a href="#bookmark15">8</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote9"></a><a href="#bookmark16">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Regardless of how bitter or indifferent individuals may be, they cannot rob us of our joy and peace if we maintain a proper mental attitude and fine Christian conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MAKE FIELD SERVICE A PLEASURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Due to not having this right mental attitude, some 'have been discouraged. Some adjustment in thinking may be needed. Be positive. Present the Kingdom message in a kindly and friendly manner. If people listen and respond, it is to their benefit. If not, you have provided a warning.—Ezek. 33:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Many of those whom we contact in the territory do not want to serve Jehovah. (Matt. 7:13) Those who are deserving will manifest themselves. Hence, continue displaying loving-kindness, mildness, and even maintaining silence when necessary. As the occasion demands, “shake the dust off your feet,” symbolically speaking, knowing that Jehovah, Jesus Christ and the holy angels are witnesses to your faithful work. —Matt. 24:14; Ezek. 33:33.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> In line with our dedication, are we dependable in our field activity? If we are elders and ministerial servants and are privileged</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">as Luke 16:10 shows.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup><a name="bookmark15"></a></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup></sup> When we enroll in the Theocratic School, can we be depended on to take the talks assigned to us? And when we speak about the truth is it according to accurate knowledge and the fine instruction we have received through Jehovah’s loyal organization?—2 Tim. 1:13.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup><a name="bookmark16"></a></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup></sup> When it comes to cleaning the Kingdom Hall, can we be depended on? Do we uphold the decisions of the elders, appreciating that their appointment is in harmony with the direction given in God’s Word through holy spirit? Are we on time for theocratic appointments? Do we turn in our field service and Bible study reSorts promptly? Do we support the lingaom Hall as the center of true worship in our area, contributing to keep it in good condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Surely we all want to be found dependable both by Jehovah and by our brothers. Just as we depend on Jehovah to supply our daily needs, along with spiritual food and guidance, we want to be used by Him in a way so that others can depend on us in time of need. —1 Pet. 4:10, 11.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Good to Those Related to You in the Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Are you aware of the spiritual' and physical needs of the brothers and sisters in your congregation? Have you considered how you might assist them? Are you in a position to do something to meet their needs? (Prov. 3:27) Or, do you usually leave such matters for others to care for?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> What a fine thing for qualified brothers to be aware of the needs of others and try to assist them before a certain trend or inclination gets them into spiritual difficulty. To a wise person, often a kindly reminder from the Scriptures is sufficient.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Some brothers with spiritual qualifications have taken a fatherly interest in some of the younger persons at the Kingdom Hall, especially those who do not come from families united in the truth, thus helping them avoid some of the problems common to youth.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Maintaining the Spirit of Helping One Another</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup>The Scriptures show that individuals have long enjoyed working together in Goa’s service. When arranging for the 70 to go ahead of him into various cities, Jesus sent them out by twos. (Luke 10:1) When Paul set out on his missionary tour, he took Timothy along to assist him. (Acts 16:1-3) Solomon also saw the need for companionship when he said: “Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their hard work.” (Eccl. 4:9) This does not mean that one should not work alone in sharing the good news. Rather, there are many benefits to working with a companion in the service and being of help to one another. How can we maintain this spirit in our congregations today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YOU CAN SHARE</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Do you feel embarrassed or even ashamed to discuss with someone else how you might improve various aspects of your service? Do you feel that because you are a teacher of God’s Word or because you have known the truth for some time that you could not benefit from working with someone else? Consider the example of Apollos. The Bible says that he was “an eloquent man . . . and he was well versed in the Scriptures.” This is much more satisfying than trying to help the person correct a problem after it has occurred.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> At Galatians 6:2 Paul writes: “Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ.” This reference to “the law of the Christ” has been linked to Jesus’ words at John 13: 34 and 35 which show that his disciples would love one another. And how encouraging it is to help lighten the burden of others in the congregation when it is possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> It would be good for each of us personally to take a few minutes to think of those we know in the congregation, perhaps in our book study group, that we might be able to help. Have we visited their homes, or invited them to visit us? One circuit overseer visited a sister who had not shared in the service for quite some time. He found that she wanted to do so but only </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font15"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Yet Aquila and Priscilla “took him into their company and expounded the way of God more correctly to him.” Apollos was not too embarrassed to accept additional truth from Aquila and Priscilla. He did not resist the help, feeling that he was already speaking “boldly in the synagogue” and did not need to know more. Rather, he accepted it and, in turn, went on to Achaia and “greatly helped those who had believed on account of God’s undeserved kindness.” While this account may not refer directly to the field service, it certainly demonstrates the kind of spirit we want to display in helping one another. —Acts 18:24-28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> One may be quite capable at placing literature but have difficulty in making return visits. Another may do well on return visits but have difficulty on the initial call. The spirit of the Scriptures is: “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.” (1 Pet. 4:10) Those with differing gifts are encouraged to work together in field service and learn from each other.</span></p></li></ul>

Invite a group of young publishers to platform to discuss chapter 8 in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book, “What Kind of Friends Do You Want?” They should have previously read material and be familiar with It.

Get comments from youths on why It is Important to select friends who live by Bible principles. Some suggestions may also be given on how friendships in the truth might be developed. What if there are few the same age in local congregation? How can youths make friends with older ones in congregation ? (1 Sam. 18:1) Jonathan was about 30 years David's senior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font14">“We Must Keep Separate from the World&quot; as presented at &quot;Living Hope” District Convention. Involve audience in reading some scriptures and commenting on the following points. Some scriptures may be assigned in advance for brief paraphrase or deleted to stay within time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Keeping separate essential for friends of Jehovah. (Jas. 4:4) We need his friendship to strengthen and comfort us. (2 Cor. 1:3, 4) We need help from our Father, Jehovah, for forgiveness of sin.—1 John 2:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus set the example In separateness from the world. (John 17:14) He</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">needed assistance. Help was given and she was able to go in the service that week. You can imagine how pleased she was that someone was concerned about her and even arranged to share a meal with her later in the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EVEN A LITTLE HELPS</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Whether we are able to do much or little is not important, but showing concern is what really counts. A card, a visit, an invitation, a phone call, perhaps sharing the day’s text over the phone, helping with some needs, physical or spiritual—all of these can help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Some sisters find it convenient to baby-sit, at times, for others who would like to go in the service. Many go out of their way to bring someone along for meetings or service. Others find it possible to visit those who are sick or in the hospital. And when this is done, have something encouraging to leave with them—an experience or a Scriptural thought, such as Psalm 55:22 or 41:3. Such thoughts can be very faith-strengthening. And all of us can pray tor one another, especially if we are aware of a problem and do not personally see how we can assist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> The early Christians’ example of hospitality is something </span><span class="font14">refused to accept political authority, advised against resorting to force or fighting. (John 18:36) Such separateness Includes neutrality on political and social issues, not becoming meddlers in affairs of others.—1 Pet. 4:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Our separateness also means not following ways of world, but upholding purity in all our conduct. (1 Pet. 1:14, 15) A person who is envious or unloving, who engages in obscene talk or favors entertainment that features works of flesh may lose God’s friendship. (Eph. 5:3-5; 1 John 4:20) Just as Jesus did not center his life on material things, neither should those who are separate from this system. (1 Tim. 6:8) Separateness also shown by Christian subjection to those having authority, whether one is employee, wife or child, at home or in school. —1 Pet. 2:17, 18; 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Separateness from world brings rich blessings. It results in a clean conscience. (1 Pet. 2:19, 20) Jehovah’s friends are known as his witnesses and they enjoy prospect of everlasting life. —Acts 15:14; 2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">8 min: “Prepare Now for Memorial!” Cover material in article and outline Memorial arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">Talk on article &quot;Walking in the Steps of the Master” in the January 15, 1980, issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Also, article on page 7 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font14"> &quot;Can You Be An Auxiliary Pioneer in April?” Encourage all to support the special arrangements for field service the first weekend in March. \ Song 65 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">that is good to imitate. It builds up our faith and strengthens the bond of love. Paul emphasizes this fine quality when he says: “So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out. Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.”—Gal. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Benefiting from the Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> How good Jehovah is to us in feeding us spiritual food as we need it! The circuit assembly program is one fine example of this. Have not all of us been more determined to fill our lives with righteous fruitage as a result of the Scriptural admonition and stirring experiences of our brothers that we heard at the last assembly? The program reminded us, too, of the great value that comes to us by submitting to the cultivator’s discipline. Surely our lives have been enriched and we have gained greater spiritual strength.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Starting in February, the program will emphasize the need for us to walk ‘as obedient children</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ATTEND THE &quot;DIVINE LOVE''</span><br><br><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>DISTRICT CONVENTION THIS SUMMER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> It is the normal desire of people who lovb one another to want to be together. This desire intensifies under conditions of stress when support and encouragement are especially needed. How natural it should be, then, for us as Jehovah’s people to come together at every opportunity in these difficult times! (Heb. 10:23-25) How much more reason we should have to attend when the theme of the convention is “Divine Love”! When you receive the February 1, 1980, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font0">(English) you will find listed therein over 100 occasions at 65 different locations where the “Divine Love” District Conventions will be held in the United States for the summer of 1980. It is our desire to see every lover of Jehovah in attendance, is it not? (1 John 5:3) In order for you to be better able to make your plans to attend as well as to assist others who may need help, we are providing the following information.—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW ROOMING ARRANGEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Finding rooming accommodations for the thousands of individuals attending a district convention has always been a major undertaking. Faithful rooming workers have been willing to offer their services year after year in behalf of those attending. Many of us remember weeks of door-to-door canvassing for rooms in preparation for larger conventions in the past when many of our brothers were accommodated in this way. However, changing times and habits of those attending conventions have reduced the number staying in private homes in recent years to the point where most can be cared for by local Witnesses. Most now prefer to stay in hotels or motels. While convention rooming departments have been happy to assist by placing brothers in private homes or in hotels and motels, in some instances at reduced rates, a growing number of our brothers have chosen to make their own arrangements directly. This has been either out of a desire to be helpful or to have a greater selection. Those doing so, however, often paid the “rack” or highest rate while those obtaining rooms through the rooming department at times received a lower group rate.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> In order to assist everyone needing accommodations and simplify the overall rooming operation, the Society has decided to take a new approach to rooming this year for those attending the “Divine Love” District Conventions. Under the new arrangement it will be easier for you to make your own arrangements directly with the hotel/ motel and yet enable everyone to share in the benefits, including lower rates, that often come from a single organization using a large number of rooms in a facility. In order for you to understand the arrangement so as to cooperate fully with it, the following information should be helpful.—Rom. 8:28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Already, qualified brothers have approached selected hotels and motels in the convention cities and have negotiated the best rates possible for those attending each convention. They have blocked off a number of rooms in several establishments of good quality to be assigned by the hotel/motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. In most cases, by the end of January 1980, your congregation will have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, their agreed-upon rate to those attending the convention and the phone number to be used in making your reservations, along with other information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font0">As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization, you should select the facility where you would prefer to stay. You should then phone the hotel or motel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">immediately,</span><span class="font0"> identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rate listed. One night’s deposit (credit card, cashier’s check or money order) will be required at all locations and should be sent</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, FEBRUARY 1980</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to them as soon as your reservations are confirmed. This deposit should be sent to the hotel or motel directly, well in advance of the cutoff date listed on the sheet (s) received from the rooming department. Motels and/or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms without a deposit or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodation you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who may desire the accommodation. The convention rooming department will be monitoring the arrangement and will provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels/motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. Remember, therefore, that it will be your responsibility to contact the hotel/ motel and make reservations based on the information provided on the list. If the hotel/ motel you call first is filled, then it will be necessary for you to call the next one you have selected from the list, and so on.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font0">A few conventions find it necessary to use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. In most cases, the congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel/motel listing is sent. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions set out on the list that will be sent to the congregation by the convention rooming department.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font0">Most arrangements to care for those with special needs have customarily originated at the local congregation where such ones attend. Elders and others who are aware of their circumstances have lovingly extended help, which is Commendable. This has often involved taking others with them in their own group—those in full-time service, the elderly, infirm or needy ones. Also they have cared for their needs in other ways, such as assisting them in making arrangements or even aiding them financially, if possible and where needed. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:18) We are confident that such loving concern will continue to be shown. (John 13:35) However, the convention rooming department will function to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who can neither be cared for by themselves nor by those in the congregation where they attend. Such ones may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at this time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though he forwards it to the convention rooming department, the individual (s) will be notified of their accommodations directly by the rooming department. Both private homes and hotel/motel accommodations will be used in caring for those with special needs, according to their circumstances. Please keep in mind that private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not made available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money, such as for a vacation, and so forth. Also, private home accommodations are for the convention period only. It would hardly seem proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates for extra days so as to visit vacation spots in the area before or after the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING OUT OF ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font0">District conventions are arranged at many locations to reduce the travel required in order to attend. In nearly every case, the location recommended for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are. planned on the premise that the great majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, a few for various reasons may choose to attend a location other than the one recommended for their congregation. Such individuals may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where they wish to attend. These addresses are listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless- the persons have special needs, they should not use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters and request a copy of the hotel/ motel listing for that location. (Be sure to include your return address when making this request.) Upon receipt of this listing of hotels/motels they should proceed just as if they were using the listing for their local area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED: </span><span class="font0">The smoothness with which the new rooming arrangement functions will largely depend on the cooperation of everyone involved—the convention rooming department, the hotels and motels, the elders serving as convention coordinators and those being accommodated. It would be good to keep two things in mind in order to avoid a problem. If a large number of delegates attempt to make hotel/motel reservations on their own before receiving the listing of facilities that are cooperating with the convention rooming department, it could cause a breakdown in some negotiations. This could occur at locations used year after year where brothers, based on rumor or assumption, have been accustomed to making very early reservations. Also, it could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose not to use the hotels and motels listed, but for one reason or another, make their own arrangements with facilities that have not cooperated as fully with the convention rooming arrangement. We hope to make the listing broad enough so as to give the brothers a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels/motels that give the best cooperation. Our aim with this new rooming arrangement is to see that our brothers and other delegates are accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, according to their circumstances, so as to be refreshed and able to enjoy fully the fine spiritual benefits of the program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING YOUR LOCATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> As already stated, it is our hope that every lover of Jehovah will be in attendance at the “Divine Love” District Convention, if at all possible. In most cases, you will be attending at the location nearest to your congregation, or where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, on the dates recommended for your circuit or portion thereof. Please find listed on page 6, in date order, each convention city and the circuits, or portions thereof, recommended to attend each convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) may have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend at a particular location, such as y<sub>2</sub> or and so forth, it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that convention would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another convention closest to them as shown elsewhere on the list.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> Your determination to be among those attending the “Divine Love” District Convention will bring rich dividends as Jehovah blesses your efforts. May your joy be made complete by planning to be present for every session from beginning to end, all four days.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TO THE BODY OF ELDERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon receipt of this insert, it will be the responsibility of the convention coordinator to meet together with the presiding overseei’ before the next service meeting. They can determine from the circuit list shown which city and dates your congregation is to attend, based on the circuit or portion thereof that your congregation is in as of the end of February. (If the coordinator is caring for both positions, he should meet with another member of the congregation service committee.) Where a fraction of a circuit (^, *4, and so forth) is involved, they should determine which location is the nearest to their congregation and plan on attending there. Then please announce at the next service meeting as well as the following </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> study the location and dates recommended by the Society for your congregation. It may be good to underline on the circuit list the recommended convention city and dates your congregation is to attend and post that portion of the insert on the information board for the benefit of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In nearly every case, the elder serving as the convention coordinator will be conducting the service meeting part covering this insert as scheduled, as well as making other announcements and handling convention material on the meetings. This will serve to acquaint the congregation with their convention coordinator, as well as enable him to better coordinate convention matters. When covering the insert on the service meeting, it would be good to have a qualified brother read all the numbered paragraphs and arrange for others to read and apply the scriptures cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the elders should be informed as to convention arrangements. They will want to cooperate fully, offering suggestions to assure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material. We appreciate very much your enthusiastic support of and kind attention to these matters.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Women Telling the Good News&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist said: “The women telling the good news are a large army.” (Ps. 68:11) In the days of Israel women joyfully proclaimed the good news of theocratic victories by song and dance. Today, within Jehovah’s organization, we have a “large army” of women who are proclaiming the good news of the victorious kingdom by their preaching and their fine conduct as Christians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> What a joy to Jehovah’s heart these exemplary Christian women must be. Like locusts they share in covering the field of preaching in response to Jesus’ command. (Matt. 24:14) The sisters generally outnumber the brothers in many countries and have a major share in the preaching work. Because of their circumstances, more of them can share as regular, special and auxiliary pioneers. Of three pioneer sisters who worked with a congregation this past summer where assistance was needed, the body of elders wrote: “Their example and zeal reminded us of the scripture at Acts 5:42. In a short time our entire congregation seemed uplifted.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> The preaching work is only a part of the service performed by you devoted sisters. As acknowledged at Proverbs 31:15, there are many other responsibilities you must care for. There is cleaning, cooking, shopping, getting children ready for school, as well as a variety of other tasks. You also seem to find time to visit, comfort and assist those in the congregation who are elderly or infirm. Such loving acts are deeply appreciated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Not all of you married sisters have believing husbands. Like Lois and Eunice, the grandmother and mother of Timothy, you have an obligation to provide for the spiritual training of your family. (2 Tim. 1:5) Some of you have lost your husbands and must carry the full financial load, looking after yourselves as well as your children. Even with all of this it is good that you do not neglect your own spiritual condition or that of your children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> At meetings it is much appreciated when our well-prepared sisters share in commenting or take part in demonstrations. Their parts in the Theocratic School often reflect their fine womanly qualities, being presented with warmth, compassion and tenderness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> After the meetings the wives of elders and ministerial servants are often seen sitting quietly or talking encouragingly to others while their husbands dutifully care for theocratic business. These sisters show themselves willing to set aside their personal preferences for the moment, knowing that their husbands are caring for necessary congregational matters. Husbands appreciate the patience and selfsacrificing attitude of such wives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> The strong faith shown by such women as Sarah, Esther, Naomi and Ruth is matched today by the women who are telling the good news. Some of you have gone through great persecution from immediate family members, relatives and others. Yet, you still continue loyally in the service of our God, Jehovah. We commend you for your faithfulness and pray that Jehovah will richly bless you as you continue to tell the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Can You Be an Auxiliary Pioneer in April?</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Have you had the privilege of serving as an auxiliary pioneer? Many blessings have come to those who have. One sister expressed it this way: “I am indeed thankful for the rich blessings, spiritual strength and beautiful experiences I have had while auxiliary pioneering.” Another said: “So many wonderful things have happened since I started auxiliary pioneering. I now have two very good Bible studies!” Perhaps you have experienced similar happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Just imagine to what a great extent the good news was preached, how much honor went to Jehovah and what encouragement it was to all the brothers when 51,008 auxiliary pioneered in this country last April. Many are looking ahead to warmer weather when they will again be arranging their schedules to auxiliary pioneer. Can you join them? Why not start making plans now to enroll!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> What are the requirements for enrollment? You must be baptized, have a reputation for good Christian conduct and have made plans to devote at least 60 hours in the field service for the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Those of you who can make room for this special privilege of service truly have many blessings in store for you as you apply yourselves to serve Jehovah and your fellowman in a whole-souled way! —Mark 12:30.</span></p></li></ul>

We can learn much from the example Jesus set in being obedient and the disposition he showed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Start thinking about the assembly now and plan to attend. Think, too, of others in the congregation or interested persons who may need encouragement to attend. We are confident you will benefit greatly from the spiritual meal that awaits you.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By Showing Personal Interest in Others (Part II)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> A couple was reminiscing about the brother who studied the Bible with them. The brother was only schooled through the fifth grade and the man being studied with was highly educated. The couple said: “We were so impressed Jby his humble yet sincere and loving attitude, his interest in us, that we agreed to study with him.” Why was this brother, though having little education, able to help a highly educated person and his wife learn the truth? It was because he projected a sincere personal interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Some have said: “I am not experienced in speaking with people at the door and find it difficult.” You may feel that way, too. However, sincere interest in others may help you reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> When you meet objections or questions that you have difficulty in answering, what do you do? Because of your sincere interest in helping the people you have spoken to, you may do some reading on the subject later and make note of supporting scriptures or you may check the scriptures listed in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font15"> under that subject. Yes, there are many ways we can show personal interest in others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> By asking questions rather than doing all the talking, you show you are interested in what the householder thinks. There are questions that call for opinions (Do you believe God will become involved in man’s affairs?), leading questions (What do you think is the greatest problem facing families today?), and even hypothetical questions (If you had the power, what would you do to change conditions in the world?). All of these can. be used effectively to better understand how one is thinking.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Asking questions would serve little purpose, however, if we did not stop and listen to the answers. Pay attention to what is said; put yourself in the other person’s place; try to understand his viewpoint. This shows that you have empathy, are interested in his welfare and want to help. Since the mind thinks much faster than a person can talk, as the person speaks there is time to analyze what is said, draw conclusions and determine how you will respond.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> When the time comes for you to respond, look for opportunities to agree with the householder.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font15">Avoid using expressions that indicate that what he has just said is not of much value in your eyes. Rather, respond in a way that shows you appreciated getting the householder’s viewpoint. At the same time help him to see the value of the Kingdom message and the need to learn more about it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Where interest is found, think about the person after leaving the door. Make proper notation on the house-to-house record of the person’s name and the subject that was discussed. Prepare and look ahead to making a return visit, thus showing that you care about the person and his eternal welfare. (Mark 6:34) It is good to follow through on these things, asking Jehovah for his blessing upon your efforts.—1 John 3:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah and Jesus show a personal interest in us by listening to our prayers, forgiving our sins, providing for our spiritual needs and examining our hearts. We, too, want to take interest in others as we present the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THROUGH THE BOOK STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> In the July through November issues of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service, </span><span class="font15">there were many fine suggestions on how we can work with one another and receive mutual benefit. (It would be good for book study conductors to review these so as to implement them through the book study arrangement.) If you would like to improve in your public preaching, why not take advantage of this fine provision. All you need to do. is approach your book study conductor or the service overseer in your congregation and make known your desire. Or, if you wish, approach a publisher who does well in the area you wish to improve in, and make arrangements to work together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> We are not all equal in experience and ability, so take advantage of those in the congregation who are “gifted” in an area of the preaching work in which you would like to improve. (1 Cor. 12:29, 30) Many are the joys that can be gained through such assistance, love and fine works.—Heb. 10:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare Now for Memorial!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Wasn’t it wonderful to have ,335,268 in this country in attendance at the Memorial celebration last year! Surely those who were there for the first time came to appreciate even more deeply the significance of the occasion and the value of Christ’s ransom. On Monday, March 31, we will again be observing the Lord’s Evening Meal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Each publisher in the congregation should begin thinking now about those whom he will want to invite to the Memorial celebration. These would include not only persons having home Bible studies, but also other interested persons who still have a respect for God’s Word, even though Bible studies with them were discontinued.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> There were about 806,000 more in attendance at the last Memorial celebration than reported as publishers for that month. So, we will be expecting many visitors to join us again this year. There is also much we can do to foilo/w through in helping Memorial attenders to come to other meetings at the Kingdom Hall. For example, the special public talk will be held on Sunday, April 6. The title of the public talk is a timely one, “Coping with Life’s Anxieties.” Publishers can do much to build up interest for this subject by pointing out how the talk will provide Bible answers not only to the causes for life’s anxieties, but how to effectively cope with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Elders and ministerial servants will be interested in meeting many of the individuals that publishers invite to the Memorial. In the March issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font15"> further information will be provided as to steps that can be taken to help these people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Begin thinking about those you are now calling on in the field service—any who used to study or who showed interest in the past, as well as friends, neighbors and relatives. Have in mind persons you will want to invite to the Memorial and also help thereafter.</span></p></li></ul>

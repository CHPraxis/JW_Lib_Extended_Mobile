<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> For 100 years now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has been keeping watch in a spiritual way. It has been bringing its readers “comfort from the Scriptures” and reliable guidance that only God’s Word, the Bible, can provide. (Rom. 15:4; Ps. 119: 105) Most of us owe much of our own spiritual development and growth to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> How grateful we are for the “food at the proper time” provided by the “faithful and discreet slave.” —Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Some observers have said, however, that people in general are no longer readers, particularly when it comes to religious material. This brings to mind the questions: What about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font3"> Is it relevant to many of the public? Does it meet their needs? In what ways can it help them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT THE READERS SAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> There is no doubt that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> does not appeal to many worldly people. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of sincere people the world over have expressed appreciation for its help. A university student in Japan said: “What particularly strengthens my <sup>1</sup></span></p></li></ul>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Reaching All Who Will Hear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Another not at home! Does that sound familiar? A circuit overseer reported working a territory in New York State where 75 percent of the people were not at home. Perhaps your territory is similar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> How can these people be reached? Calling back will help, but often it is the same people who are not there. Something else is needed. Informal witnessing? Yes! The following experience shows its effectiveness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> A couple stopped in a supermarket. The sister started a conversation with the butcher, who quickly responded to her discussion on the new order. He wondered how such a thing could be. The sister’s husband joined the conversation and suggested they continue the discussion at the person’s home. He agreed, inviting them to stop by that very evening. They witnessed to the man and his wife on one subject, God’s purpose for the earth. It made such an impression that the next day this couple went to the Kingdom Hall. Now baptized, they are informally witnessing to many of their relatives. Could informal witnessing aid you in reaching more people?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">faith are the clear explanations of Bible prophecies. I have been amazed by the stupendous depths of God’s wisdom that I have perceived through these wonderful articles.” A thankful young reader wrote: “When first introduced to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> I was a disillusioned teen-ager. I felt insecure, had little communication with my parents, and was desperately in need of guidance. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">filled that need.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Besides expressing appreciation in general, many are the comments on the practical and timely material in each issue. For example, a reader in South Africa wrote: “I want to tell you how much I enjoy and benefit from the articles on the Psalms. I have always found the Psalms hard to understand and am really grateful for these articles. I feel the same way about the articles on the Sermon on the Mount.” And note this interesting comment from a Jewish reader on the article “Something New About God’s Name”: “I grew up Jewish but never did I hear that name. You can’t imagine how thrilled I was to read the irrefutable evi-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font3"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> When witnessing informally to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">those you do not know</span><span class="font3"> the following suggestions may be helpful to you. Be friendly, warm and complimentary, and be sure your facial expressions reflect this friendliness. Pick a subject that is of interest to people in the community. You may offer some of the publications, or you may choose to share an appropriate scripture on the subject under consideration. If interest is aroused, you could suggest a further discussion at their home. If this does not interest them, wish them well and comment that it was nice to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> During the winter months people are in a hurry to get out of the cold weather. Be alert. Use opportunities while indoors, waiting in lines at supermarkets, shopping plazas or other indoor areas. When warmer weather returns, people will be outside more, sitting in parks, window-shopping, working in their yards or just walking. Could you approach some of them? Take the initiative. Share the lifesaving message we have with as many as you can.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You the Only Member of Your Family in the Truth?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup>What a blessing it is when we find entire families serving Jehovah together! However, not all are in such a happy condition. Many of our brothers and sisters are the only ones in their family serving Jehovah. Certainly they are to be commended for the fine example of faithfulness and endurance they show.—2 Thess. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PARENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> In your congregation do you have sisters who nave children but whose husbands are not in the truth, or are even opposed? One mother wrote: “I have to be the breadwinner—I have to shop, clean, cook, sew, and listen to my children’s problems,” in addition to getting the entire family to meetings and into the service. Yes, such fine examples truly deserve our commendation and our help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> What can be done to help? Some younger publishers have especially befriended the children in these divided homes in order to provide good companionship. Experienced publishers have assisted by conducting Bible studies with the children and by helping them get out in the service regularly. One family made themselves available to help a sister whose husband was not in the truth. Later, this family kindly included the sister’s husband in some theocratic social activities. Eventually the husband agreed to a Bible study and became a dedicated, baptized publisher.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUNGER PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Many of our teen-age or younger publishers are the only ones of their families in the truth. In spite of strict family tradition and intense pressure to pursue higher education, one young Oriental brother stood firm in his determination to pioneer. By his fine example, his younger sister also</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What They Need! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">dence in this most recent article. I cannot wait to get my hands on more copies.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> So, back to the questions: Is it relevant to many of the public? Does it meet their needs? The answer is a definite Yes! Indeed, in the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">we have what they need, and we have every reason to be positive in recommending it to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> This month, we will be offering the subscription, along with a free book, on a $2.50 contribution. (See Announcements for details.) Also, accepted the truth and both of them are now pioneering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Young publishers whose parents are not in the truth often need help and guidance, both spiritual and physical. Many older ones have kindly helped by taking a personal interest in these younger ones, becoming spiritual fathers and mothers to them, as it were. Concerning one young Bible student, a family wrote: “She was encouraged to pray, to use Bible principles in her life and to be more respectful and patient with her parents.” The family assisted her to attend an international convention and she is now progressing toward baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ELDERLY OR HANDICAPPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Those who are elderly or handicapped are very much appreciated in the congregation even though they may be limited in their preaching activity. If you are one of these, we want to assure you that your determination and loyal service is faith strengthening to us. —Prov. 16:31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Many older or handicapped persons nave spent their youth and vigor in Jehovah’s service, and now they may be alone. Certainly we do not want to overlook them now. Just spending a little time with them may be greatly appreciated. Too, it may be that we can help them with shopping and chores, or to get to meetings and out in field service. One family assisted an elderly widow whose only child died. While they provided comfort, they also gave personal help in handling legal matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> If you are the only member of your household in the truth, be assured of our loving concern for your spiritual welfare. Working and associating with you results in mutual encouragement, and we thank Jehovah for the good work you are doing.—1 Thess. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">you will be pleased to know that the January issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will feature scriptures set off by themselves, or set in a box, so that they can be used easily in the field. Among them will be 2 Peter 3:13 and Revelation 21:4, which point to “God’s Promise of Something New.” Endeavor to help as many as possible to see that they, too, need </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS ) --------------------------------------------------------------------------'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Showing Persona! Interest in Others (Part I)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> When introducing ourselves at the door, we should always take the feelings of others into consideration. Without a doubt, people can sense whether we are interested in them as persons or if we just have some other objectives in mind, such as getting through our sermon or making literature placements. Obviously, to gain the householders’ attention and interest, we need to show a sincere personal interest in them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> How do we do this? Basically it is by finding </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font3"> interest and building on it. One way this can be done is by being observant. As we approach a house, what do we look for? Are there children’s toys or bicycles? Is the yard well groomed, with no litter? Is there new paint on the house? Are there many locks on the door? Do you see something that possibly indicates their religion? Are there stickers or slogans on the door or the car that reveal something?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> We may not always draw the right conclusion from these outward signs. However, what we observe may help to influence the initial direction that our conversation takes as we endeavor to establish a point of mutual interest. Remember, too, a little commendation often goes a long way with people. A kind word about their</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “Have You Ever Wondered . . . ?” That is the heading of a new feature in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font3"> starting January 8. It takes the place of what formerly appeared as “The Bible’s View, and, with few exceptions, it will appear on pages three and four of each magazine.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Why the change? It is done in order to reach persons who think they have little or no interest in religion or the Bible. In many parts of the world, anything that is labeled “Bible” tends to close the people’s mind. Of course, the new feature will still direct attention to the Bible, though usually not at the beginning of the article. We do not want to insist that the person agree that he is interested in the Bible before he starts to consider the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The articles will cover subjects well-mannered children, or a comment on the fine way they care for their property may appeal to the householder and help you gain a hearing ear better than might any amount of “preaching.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that men, women and youths have different interests. For example, older men and women often find the economy their chief concern. Working people traditionally base their interest on their career and personal attainment. Mothers are generally interested in the home, children and babies, as well as the affairs that anguish the heart—death, illness, accidents, community tragedies, crime. Youths want to know why they are here, where they are going and what the future holds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> A traveling overseer observed: “Those who are effective in their work (in the field) are not always those who are simply using techniques of one kind or another. They are publishers who show a love for people, reflect friendliness and a desire to help and encourage. Their calls are not directed solely at placing literature but getting acquainted and being interested in the people they meet, their problems, daily life and families.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Can you show greater love for your neighbors by demonstrating a sincere personal interest in those you meet in the field?—Mark 12: 30, 31.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A government decree, dated January 3, 1979, banned the work of Jehovah's Witnesses in Paraguay. This past October our brothers appealed the matter to the Supreme Court, but as yet no judicial decision has been handed down. ♦ Fine reports have been received from the worldwide field indicating that the 1980 service year got off to a good start. There were 15 countries that reported new, all-time publisher peaks during the month of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A GOOD REPORT!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is a pleasure to see that Jehovah's blessing has been on our work in the United States during the 1979 service year. Eveiy month, on the average, there were 521,370 publishers sharing in Jehovah's service, which represents an increase of about 1.5 percent. We had a peak of 533,781 publishers. And there was a 29-percent increase in auxiliary pioneers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the close of the service year, there were 7,464 congregations in operation, 19 more than last year. We saw increases in book and magazine placements. We spent more hours in the field service, made more return visits and conducted more home Bible studies. A total of 26,958 were baptized. A good report indeed! And, with you we |om in praising Jehovah, who gives the increase. —1 Cor. 3:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">It will be appropriate for the committee to speak with him and let him know that their decision is that he should be disfellowshiped from the congregation. They should ask him if he intends to appeal. He may do this if he believes a serious error in Judgment was committed. In the event that he wishes to appeal, announcement of the disfellowshlping decision would be held In abeyance. In that case the person should be told that he will be allowed one week's time to make his appeal in writing to the Judicial committee giving his reasons. When such written appeal Is received, the body of elders should arrange for an appeal committee to rehear the case within a week whenever possible. They may use local elders or elders from nearby congregations: these should be men who are experienced and qualified. If a traveling overseer can conveniently participate, or suggest who might serve on the appeal committee, it would be good. The elders may wish to telephone the branch office for counsel on forming an appeal committee. However, this usually is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the other hand, if the accused person does not Indicate that he wishes to appeal, the Judicial committee will draw up an appropriate brief announcement to be read to the congregation. Additionally, they should explain to the accused person the need for repentance and what other steps he can take toward being reinstated in due time. This would be both helpful and kind, with the hope that he will change his ways, and with time qualify to return to Jehovah’s organization. —2 Cor. 2:6, 7.</span></p>

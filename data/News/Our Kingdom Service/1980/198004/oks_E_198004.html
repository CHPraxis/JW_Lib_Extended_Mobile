<p><span class="font1">Are We &quot;Fishers of Men&quot;?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Picture in your mind, please, a J roup of fishermen in the days of esus and the apostles returning to shore after fishing all night. They had worked hard letting their nets down and drawing in the catch. Rowing the boat, often against the wind, was strenuous and tiring. But their teamwork paid off. There was a good catch and people were mingling with these hardworking men at the docks. Now there were fish to be sold at the markets. It was an exciting and rewarding time. Soon these men were ready to go home and get some sleep. But they would return again in search of a new catch.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A number of Jesus’ apostles, perhaps seven of them, were professional fishermen. Four of them, Peter, Andrew, James and John, worked together as partners. (Matt. 4:18, 21) They worked well together as a group and were very much dependent on one another. They had to be in order to succeed in their endeavor. No wonder Jesus selected personalities like these to be “fishers of men.” Do we today “slave” for Jehovah in this same way? It is good to ask ourselves whether we also qualify as “fishers of men” under the Lord’s direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> While the work of shepherding falls primarily on a few, all followers of Christ are called upon to be</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Speak from Your Heart's Abundance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “A good man brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart, . . . for out of the heart’s abundance his mouth speaks.” (Luke 6:45) These words of wisdom came from the lips of Jesus, and they should have a deep and long-lasting effect on all who wish to have the approval of our God and Creator, Jehovah. Day in and day out mankind is faced with problems of life that are not conducive to producing the good works that identify one as a close follower of the Lord Jesus. The hearts of people in general have been hardened by the environment around them, much like ancient Pharaoh whose heart “became obstinate” against God. -</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Many hardened hearts have been softened by the healing power of God’s Word and its abundant truths. The Bible account even tells of a vast mixed company that left Egypt with the Israelites at the time the tenth plague came upon the land. Their hearts were apparently softened by the demon“fishers of men.” (Matt. 4:19) How? By doing the preaching work and seeking out worthy ones to share in the separating work, which is watched over by Jehovah. In this connection we might ask ourselves if we are prepared to fish for men as effectively as we could be. Do we cooperate with our book study group, helping others to fish well or letting others who are skilled fishermen help us in our teaching and disciple-making work so we can have a “catch”? If we need help in our fishing, it is readily available among our fellow fishermen.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> There are, of course, some territories in which the “fishing” is quite good and we usually cover such more often in our witnessing. On the other hand, all of our territory should be worked at least once a year. And whether there is an instant “catch” or not, our responsibility is to continue to let the nets down in all waters. (Luke 5:1-11) Just as a successful fisherman remains optimistic and gets real satisfaction from his work, so we should not become easily discouraged but look for opportunities to go ‘fishing for men.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Speaking about opportunities, think of those who recently attended the Memorial. Many who </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1} </span><span class="font10">stration of Jehovah’s power. (Ex. 12:38) But what about us? Out of the abundance of our hearts are we producing good things that are a blessing to us and to those with whom we associate? How do we know if we have good things in our hearts and are able to speak out and do good?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> You may ask yourself the following questions: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Do I rejoice as much today as when I first learned of the salvation by Jehovah through Jesus and began associating with Jehovah’s people<sup>1</sup>?</span><span class="font10"> By the year 96 C.E., the congregation of Christians in Ephesus were said to have left the love they had at first, and that brought strong counsel to them.—Rev. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Do I concern myself with a continued personal study of Jehovah’s Word as I did when I first learned of his grand promises through Christ?</span><span class="font10"> The apostle Paul admonished Timothy to pay constant attention to himself and to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font10"> 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Responding to Our Christian Commission. Discussion. All have been stimulated by attending the Memorial celebration. True meaning of that event was made clear. Events following Jesus’ death are of great Interest to us as well. Have good readers handle the following: (Read Matthew 28:1-8.) What occurred even as Jesus had promised? (Read Matthew 28:16-20.) What commission did the disciples receive from Jesus? What position did Jesus now occupy in heaven and on earth? What obligation that Jesus there gave applies even to this day, and what comforting assurance did he give to us? (Read John 21:15-17.) How did Jesus emphasize to Peter the importance of a spiritual feeding program? What impression should this make upon our hearts and minds today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font9">Giving Further Aid to Memorial Attenders. Service overseer goes over the need to make return visits on those who attended the Memorial to help them into further association with the congregation. Such ones who are not subscribers to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">magazine should be given the opportunity to subscribe.

Emphasize paragraph four If your territory Is worked often or there Is very little response, outlining our responsibility as &quot;fishers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">To be developed locally or have talk on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> article ‘How Some Have Been Helped to Believe” in November 8, 1979, Issue pages 11-15.</span></p>

Tie in importance of telling others of our hope and sharing Kingdom good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font9">Discussion of portion of Sermon on the Mount. (Matt. 5:13-16) Elder to handle this portion based on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> of March 15, 1978, pages 10, 11. (1) (Have verse 13 read.) Salt not only enhanced the taste of food, but served to prevent decay or corruption. Thus how should one conduct himself? How could a Christian, by discontinuing his efforts to share the &quot;good news of God’s kingdom, lose his ‘‘saltness&quot;? What could occur if the Christian failed to follow the Bible's moral guide? (2) (Have verses 14, 15 read.) By public witnessing activities, disciples of Jesus enlighten people, help them know God's purpose for mankind. How could a person put his light under a measuring basket? What would then result to the light he has? (3) (Have verse 16 read.) Others, by observing a Christian’s &quot;fine works,” can perceive the excellence of his God. Therefore, what is the responsibility of the Christian at all times? What effect can this have on others seeking to find the light of truth? How does 1 Peter 2:12 counsel all who want to let their light shine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Elder reports on how the congregation has done in the auxiliary pioneer service so far during the month.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">“Carry On as Men”! Talk by elder on article. In paragraph four consider experiences of parents who have encouraged their children to enter full-time service, even forgoing certain luxuries so children could pioneer, go to Bethel or even enter missionary work. (There may be some locally who could relate their personal experiences in this regard. If not, see 3/15/77 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> pages 168-171. and 4/15/77 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> pages 249-253.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 50, local announcements and Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: To be developed locally, or consider material in the December 15, 1979, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> article, “How Powerful Is the Good News?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Do Not Lose Your Joy. Elder gives talk, with audience participation, on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font9"> book material beginning on page 970 under the subheading “Joy in God’s Service.” Highlight points in second paragraph, showing that one should have the joy that comes from heart appreciation. (This does not mean that it is always easy to share in some features of Kingdom service, but when a person makes the effort, he receives the joy of Jehovah because Jehovah blesses effort even though there may be few visible results.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">What Are Your Children Learning? Handled by an elder interviewing young children on Stories 114 and 115 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font9"> book. Quiz young ones and help them to see how they and their parents can use the book In field service during May. Elder may also give a talk for five minutes on the value of this publication to the public. Encouragement should be given to all to have a share in field service the first Sunday in May. (Perhaps a report can be given on the past month's results in this activity.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 68 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Heart's Abundance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">his teaching. (1 Tim. 4:16) This included continuing to give personal attention to the Word of God, even as Timothy had done from infancy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Do I seize opportunities to tell others of my firm hope in God and his promises for mankind in the future?</span><span class="font10"> The Bible abounds with accounts of early Christians giving of themselves to pass along the truth to others. Jesus, Paul, Peter, Barnabas, Timothy, Silas and others stand out as splendid examples of those whose hearts were abundantly filled with good that they passed along to others. —Matt. 4:23; Acts 5:42; 13:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Do I daily conduct myself in such a way that others can observe that I practice what I speak about to others?</span><span class="font10"> Paul showed how ineffective one’s words would be if his conduct did not match his words. He wrote to the Roman Christians: “You, the one preaching ‘Do not steal,’ do you steal? You, the one saying ‘Do not commit adultery,’ do you commit adultery?” He went on to show that it is what a person is on the inside that counts with God and testifies to men that he is indeed a follower of Christ.—Rom. 2:21-29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> At the outset of this article mention was made that mankind is faced with problems today that are not conducive to producing good works. On every hand we see violence, crime, immorality and hatred filling the hearts of so many. Oftentimes the message we bear is rudely rejected and we may become disheartened. It is at these times in particular that we need to turn to Jehovah for his help through Christ. We do well to call to mind all the good things we have, fill our hearts to overflowing, and then make efforts to help others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah, through his organiza-' tion, has provided us with the in-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Published monthly by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 Our Kingdom Service (USPS 295-360) Second-class postage paid at Brooklyn, N.Y. Printed in U.S.A.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Carry On as Men&quot;!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ When we speak to people in their homes or on other occasions, often the man of the house will say that his wife takes care of the religion in the family. It seems quite evident that the larger percentage of those in attendance at churches today are women rather than men. Among Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, the man plays an important role since the Bible assigns him the responsibility to care for the spiritual interests of his family and the congregation. —1 Cor. 16:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Thus, when a man does take interest in the spiritual welfare of his family and takes the lead in religious activity, it often causes others to take note. We rejoice when we see men coming into association with us through Bible studies and attendance at the meetings, and then advancing to baptism and further maturity. It is certainly a pleasure to have them among us, and we look forward to their further advancement to the point where they can assist in giving spiritual care to the sheeplike ones in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Elders in the congregation do have a heavy responsibility. They not only have to care for themselves and their families, but must take an interest in the spiritual needs of others. Often they give of themselves far into the night handling problems of others, seeking to give them Scriptural counsel. Elders need to know where to go in the Scriptures for proper guidance and how to handle problems in a loving and kind way. These brothers are deeply appreciated by all in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In caring for their own families, the brothers have a large and important assignment. Sometimes it may appear to be a thankless one, especially when children seem to be negative about their responsibilities in attending meetings and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Fishers of Men&quot;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">came this year attended before and know something about the truth and Jehovah’s organization. But what can we do to help them grow spiritually?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> One thing we can do is to call on these people without delay to show we are interested in them and that we want to help them spiritually. Encourage them to attend the meetings with you. If they do not have a Bible study, can you start one with them? We want to help these people now and assist them to see the value of associating with Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Then, during the first week in developing a good Christian conscience. We are reminded of one case of a father who had for some time allowed his children almost total freedom in coming and going, not requiring anything of them in building a spiritual personality. Then the day came when he saw that he must do something. As his two teen-age children said, “he put his foot down,” insisting on their undertaking a serious study of the Bible. It was not easy at first, but as the children reported: “We could see by his firm, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">loving</span><span class="font10"> tone that he was serious about Bible knowledge.” These children progressed in knowledge, and commented: “We dedicated our lives to Jehovah, were baptized and soon after started pioneering. Nine years have passed since then and we have never regretted that our Dad ‘put his foot down’ to us.” Can you imagine how thankful that father must be to see how applying Bible principles does have its rewards and builds appreciation in children.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is fine to see that many younger brothers are making good progress spiritually, and some are reaching out for greater responsibilities. Some are rendering helpful service in the congregation, while others have received appointments as ministerial servants and elders. All, however, endeavor to work in the interests of their brothers and members of their families. Rather than being like the majority of mankind in today’s world, leaving religion to the women, these brothers of ours are a great help to the “faithful and discreet slave” class in caring for the Lord’s interests entrusted to them. May Jehovah continue to bless them and may he add to their ranks in the time yet remaining, that all of us may benefit from their labors of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May we are asking the elders and ministerial servants to approach you to see how many you personally have been able to assist to get to the meetings or to help by conducting a study with them. If you have not been successful it is hoped that a visit from one of the elders, perhaps your book study conductor, or from one of the ministerial servants will assure these new ones that we are really interested in their spirituality. As Christ’s disciples we must prove we really have love for one another and for the strangers.—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> It is good to remember that the One in charge of all the “fishing”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Have You Tried It Yet?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our objective in our preaching work from house to house and elsewhere is to communicate with people. If possible, we want to get a conversation started and then seek to interest the individuals in the message of the Kingdom that we have for them. It is not always so easy to do this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To assist us, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazine since January has featured the first article, “Have You Ever Wondered ...” followed by a question designed to encourage conversation. Some of the questions in the past several months have been: “If God is love, why does he permit wickedness?” “Is there any real solution to the energy crisis?” “What can keep families together?” “How many real friends do I have?” and “Will the rising cost of living ever end?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Would you not agree that these are questions that many would be willing to discuss? Have you tried mentioning the question in the title and then reading the first paragraph or part of it? The opening paragraph will usually be short and will contain material designed to catch the attention of the householder. It makes it easier to start a conversation. Also, by following up with the question in the bold type after the first paragraph, you can invite the householder to express himself. This way the conversation is not one-sided, with only the Witness doing the talking.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Though the special April issues do not carry this feature, it will be continued in the coming months. For example, the May 8 issue will ask: “Are horoscopes reliable guides?” People today are looking for trustworthy guidance. This, question could open up a fine discussion and make it possible for us to show that the Bible is the finest guide available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The use of this feature in the magazine may open up many lively conversations. We individually will never know just how successful it can be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">unless we try it.</span><span class="font10"> Have you tried it yet?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">today is well acquainted with how much hard work is involved in getting a catch. He constantly commends us and rewards us for our participation in the fishing work. If each one of us does what he or she can to set aside time regularly for fishing, and follows through on every “bite,” surely we can look to Jehovah for his direction and blessing on our efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With a Positive Attitude</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How do you feel about offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription this month? Are you enthused and looking for opportunities to share in this activity? To a large degree this depends upon your individual outlook. Realistically, we are not going to get a subscription at most doors. But we want to keep in mind that when a person accepts a subscription he is multiplying his exposure to the truth. Out of 24 issues, there may very well be at least one article that will catch his eye and reach his heart. Following are two extraordinary experiences that highlight the value of (1) having a positive attitude about the importance of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">magazine and (2) offering subscriptions at every opportunity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One sister placed 90 subscriptions during the last subscription campaign. How did she do it? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">She took advantage of every opportunity.</span><span class="font10"> For example, she was going from door to door and saw a group of workmen digging up the street. She approached them and explained what she was doing. The result? She obtained 24 new subscriptions. Later she was going from door to door and met a lady who was having a luncheon for her friends. She discreetly presented the magazines and another 12 subscriptions were placed. One rainy morning several different persons called her on the telephone and she placed 10 subscriptions before she left the house. Obviously Jehovah was blessing her efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many of us have experienced the blessings of witnessing informally. One brother recently went on a business trip. On his return flight he started to converse with the man sitting next to him who turned out to be an army colonel. Their conversation led to the problem this man was having with his wife. After 20 years of marriage his wife was on drugs, had tried to commit suicide several times and was about to leave him for a younger man.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ <sup>4</sup> Our brother told this military man about the fine Scriptural help and encouragement given him each time he receives the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines. The man asked how he could get these magazines for himself and also wanted them sent to his wife. Our brother inquired as to' the address of his wife, but the colonel couldn’t find a pen. Before the brother could get his pen, the man sitting next to the window put one in the colonel’s</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">hand. He had been listening even though our brother did not know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The plane landed and when the brother got up to get off, the couple seated in front of him turned and had tears in their eyes as did two students from a local Bible school seated across the aisle. The lady in front said she wanted the magazines also. The two students across the aisle said, “Don’t leave us out. We want them too.” Thus, by taking the initiative while on this business trip, a total of 22 subscriptions, 21 books and 45 magazines were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Obviously experiences like these do not happen every day. But even if we try all month and get no results, we have still done the right thing. We appreciate the value of this journal and realize the influence for good it has in our lives. So endeavor to keep the magazines before the public during April. We pray that Jehovah will go with each one of us as we do.</span></p>

During this month of April we will be providing such information for those we meet in our daily contacts through the door-to-door work, on the streets, in stores and other informal conversations. How might we do this? By carrying a few copies of these magazines with us. When opportunity affords, speak from the abundance of the heart. May all of us together bring forth good out of the good treasure of our hearts, for out of our hearts’ abundance our mouths will speak. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings for Field Service </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>

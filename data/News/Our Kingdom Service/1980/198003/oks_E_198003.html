<p><span class="font2">What Are You Doing in Remembrance of Him?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>What a grand privilege it will be for us, on March 31, 1980, to be ' present for the 1,947th anniversary of the Lord’s Evening Meal! On that first memorable occasion, you </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">j/r</span><span class="font12"> will recall, Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) Their close relationship with Jesus, no doubt,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">heightened their appreciation of the significance of his sacrificial death. The apostle Peter, reflecting back over the earthly life and ministry of Jesus, wrote to fellow Christians: “To this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.”—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> At the early age of 12, Jesus demonstrated a keen appreciation for spiritual things. When separated from his parents for three days after the Passover celebration, he was found in the house of his Father, “sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and questioning them.” Yes, Jesus “went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.” (Luke 2:3952) If you are a young person, are you doing that too?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Jesus was a man of action. Zeal</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">Prepare for a Fitting Observance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> This year the Memorial (Nisan 14) will be celebrated after sundown on Monday, March 31, 1980. How can we as followers of Christ prepare for a fitting observance of this important occasion? One fine way is to reflect on the earthly life of Jesus, mankind’s loving, priceless Redeemer. (Matt. 20:28) To aid in this, we recommend that all of Jehovah’s people, individually or as family groups, read and review the article “He ‘Loved Them to the End’ ” in the March 1, 1980, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Last year a schedule was published for family Bible reading before the Memorial. It covered each of the six days of Jesus’ activity prior to his death as recorded in the book of Mark. Many families of Jehovah’s people, whole congregations and Bethel families appreciated sharing in these Bible readings. for the house of his Father was in evidence when he single-handedly drove out those who were making Jehovah’s temple a house of merchandise. (John 2:14-17) Jesus was never afraid to speak the truth with boldness. (John 3:1-12) He taught masterfully as was indicated by the reaction of those who were present for his Sermon on the Mount. Matthew tells us that “the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching; for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.” (Matt. 7:28, 29) Are you zealous and bold in speaking about Jehovah’s name and kingdom?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN DO</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jesus saw the wisdom of reaching people through varied methods of preaching. After gaining the victory over death, before his ascension to heaven, he left instructions for his disciples to carry on the work that he nimself started. (Consider Matthew 28:19, 20.) Could you have an increased share in this work this month? Could you share in the auxiliary pioneer work? Consider evening witnessing as well. Such increased field activity will afford us the opportunity to invite our Bible students as well as all </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 2, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We are here providing a suggested schedule for Bible reading this year. It is taken from Matthew, Luke and John. While last year’s readings were listed for the day prior to the date of the Biblical happenings, you will notice that this year’s readings are scheduled for the same day that the events actually occurred, beginning after sundown of the current calendar days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We Appreciate Our Youths</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Since the time of the first human family Jehovah God has made provision for youths to be meaningfully involved in true worship. Accordingly the psalmist sang: “You are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovaih, my confidence from my youth.”—Ps. 71:5; Gen. 4:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How happy we are to have our youths praising Jehovah with us! Like Jehovah God, we appreciate their faithful service. Many persons have been attracted to the Kingdom message by young publishers. Sometimes our most zealous workers are youths. As they grow up in the truth, their spirituality can make a significant contribution to the overall spirituality of the congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Bible prophecy foretold the problems of youths that are so prevalent today. (2 Tim. 3:1, 2) While it is true that some young ones in various congregations have had serious problems, how happy we are when they respond to efforts that help them to recover from some form of wrongdoing and thereafter make real progress as fine Christian youths. Like Timothy, however, many of our young brothers and sisters have developed from infancy to adulthood, untarnished by the spirit of the world. (2 Tim. 3:14; Acts 16:1) Young ones who are conducting themselves well as Christians are deserving of commendation, particularly when we consider the pressures that many are subjected to from unbelieving companions and, sometimes, from schoolteachers, who may deride their Biblebased viewpoints. The faith of our young brothers and sisters condemns the ungodly world around them and attracts honest-hearted ones to the truth.—Heb. 11:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">* To illustrate what is being done, one young sister who was teased and ridiculed because of her modest dress and labeled as “untouchable,” was not intimidated into conforming to this world’s ungodly standards. Instead she explained that as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses that was the standard she kept. The teacher of another young publisher presented the evolution theory as fact and the Bible as myth. Loyally defending the Bible resulted in this publisher’s ' being able to start a number of Bible studies. Some of those showing interest began attending meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We encourage all of you young ones among us to keep on “progressing in wisdom . . . and in favor with God and men.” (Luke 2:51, 52) Jehovah God invites you to act wisely, appreciating your role in the ‘great issue.’ (Prov. 27: 11) Your God-given assignment is to ‘fear God and keep his commandments.’ (Eccl. 12:13) Continue developing as stable, helpful and trustworthy members of your families, honoring your father and your mother. (Eph. 6:1-3) As disciples of Jesus Christ, participate regularly in the meetings and field service activities. As you continue to progress, devoting yourselves to Jehovah God in an unbreakable relationship, you can be sure that many blessings from Jehovah await you both now and in the future.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">• What forms of address are recommended for use during congregational meetings ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Jesus taught his followers to pray, he Instructed them to address Jehovah as “Our Father.’’ This thought of a spiritual family relationship between all of his followers was further emphasized when he told them “all you are brothers.” (Matt. 23:8) Many times the apostles and disciples of Jesus used the term &quot;brother In a very direct sense. Peter referred to Paul as ’’our beloved brother Paul” and Paul spoke of “Titus my brother,” and &quot;our brother Timothy.&quot;—2 Pet. 3:15; 2 Cor. 2:13; Heb. 13:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In view of this close spiritual relationship, Jehovah’s Witnesses normally address each other as &quot;brother” and &quot;sister.” They generally do this along with the last name during congregational meetings. For the one presiding to use first names can, at times, cause certain problems. If a person were new to our meetings and we were not too well acquainted with him, he could feel we were being overly familiar if we called upon him by his first name since last names are customarily used when people are gathered at Christian meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whereas, the one presiding could call on very young children by their first name, were he to call older persons by their first name some may view this as a lack of respect. Or take the case of a sister whose husband is not In the truth but comes to a meeting for the first time. How will he feel if he hears his wife called by her first name by another married man In front of the whole congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Such difficulties are resolved If those conducting meetings use last names when calling on Individuals to comment. We would not address newly Interested persons as “brother” or “sister” since the spiritual relationship of God’s family does not exist In their case. Rather use the first and last names together or preface the last name with the more formal </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mr., Mrs. </span><span class="font11">or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Miss</span><span class="font11"> unless there is a reason for making an exception.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Making Good Use of Literature</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How thankful we are for the publications Jehovah provides through his organization to keep us well fed spiritually. We eagerly thumb through new releases at conventions or the magazines when they come in the mail. Then we read them to gain the knowledge that aids us to know Jehovah and his purposes better. But this literature is not just for us. It is valuable in our preaching and disciplemaking work.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> While our goal is not just to place literature when we go in service, nevertheless, when we are well acquainted with what is in the publications we are anxious to get them into the hands of as many people as possible so they may be aided to learn the truths they contain. If we view the publications as God-given instruments to spread the truth, we will put forth conscientious effort to place them with the public.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Sometimes people are genuinely very busy when we call. Have you ever replied saying: “Since you do not have time to talk now, perhaps you would accept these two magazines? You can read them when you have some time and learn more about God’s promise of something new. They are yours on a 20-cent contribution.” Many magazines have been placed this way, and experiences have been related about individuals who have been aided to recognize the truth by reading just one of our magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> There are obviously times when it may not be appropriate to offer literature. But if we remember that someone may read the literature and benefit from it, whether it is the person we talk to or another member of the household, then we will want to offer the literature whenever it is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> During March we are offering one of the 50-cent books in our regular house-to-house activity. After introducing ourselves we might say: “Our purpose in visiting you today is to share God’s promise of something new. When we see crime, violence and warfare in different parts of the world, it makes us long for a change to new and better conditions, doesn’t it? [Allow for reply.] In 2 Peter 3:11, we read the promise that all wicked things will be done away with. And, notice here in verse 13 what is to come. [Read verse.] God promises a new system of things, one wherein righteousness is to dwell. [At this point, if it seems advisable, you may go on to Revelation 21:1, 4 to aid the householder to learn more about God’s promises.] We are interested in helping people like you to learn more about God’s promises, and an aid to doing so is this publication.” Then show the book you are offering and highlight some point in it on God’s promises.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> There are times when we meet individuals who tell us that they are having family problems. There may be little ones in the home or teen-agers. We may feel the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font12"> book, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book, or some other publication would be particularly appropriate for the person. (You decide.) A householder may express doubts about God’s existence or the value of the Bible. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font12"> book will likely be helpful here. If the person we are talking to mentions that someone in the family has died, he may be comforted by thoughts in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There 1st</span><span class="font12"> In any case, have in mind the objective of starting a study, perhaps right on the initial call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Let us use the publications as a supplement to our oral testimony, to help answer questions, or so the householder can learn more at his own convenience. We can use them as an outline for discussions and as study aids. Yes, the publications come in handy in our house-to-house work, on return visits, for Bible studies, in street work and when doing informal witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> What if we meet people who are genuinely interested but cannot contribute for the literature? There may be occasions when we conscientiously feel it is proper to give them a publication. However, we would not want to make a practice of giving literature away, especially if no real interest is shown. And while we may at times put a back issue of a magazine under the door if someone is not at home, this may not be appropriate in frequently covered territory. When it is done, be sure that the magazine is put completely out of sight so thieves are not made aware that no one is at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Continue to show appreciation for and use the fine literature Jehovah’s organization has provided.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Reading these passages carefully will enable each one of us to reflect upon Jesus and his activity during the closing days of his ministry. As we read this material, we should also give serious thought to our own personal standing before Jesus and Jehovah. Such selfexamination, which often results in greater appreciation for spiritual things, is appropriate at any time. However, it is particularly fitting in preparation for the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal. Additionally, our zealous participation in the field service gives us opportunity to make public declaration of our faith in and appreciation for our King and Ransomer, Christ Jesus, and for Jehovah who is ‘the Giver of every good and perfect gift.’ (Jas. 1:17) In keeping with the importance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, let each of us prepare well for a fitting observance.</span></p>

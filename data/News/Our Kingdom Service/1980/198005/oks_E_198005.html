<p><span class="font5">A Marvelous Instrument to Aid All</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> “Just what we need,” said an elder to the congregation. “They are going like ‘hot cakes,’ ” said another brother. An interested woman wrote to the Society, “Please find enclosed a check for $120 for the initial purchase of 60 books. Please forward to me as quickly as possible.” Yes, comments like these can be repeated many times over. They illustrate the point that we do have a marvelous instrument to aid all. What is this instrument? It is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories!</span><span class="font6"> Since its release at the “Victorious Faith” International Convention in 1978, over 9,000,000 copies have been printed in 19 languages, with plates being readied for printing in 12 more languages during the first part of 1980.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> How can we make good use of this publication? There are many fine features that are appealing to the eye and heart: its chronological order, large print, many pictures, self-teaching style, and its short stories. We can use these to aid all.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL ARE AIDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The teaching value of the book’s pictures is indeed great,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Enjoy Summer Opportunities and Use Them Well</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> As we anticipate summertime with its milder weather, we are glad we can enjoy a variety of activities and the refreshment it brings. While we may plan for a change of pace during our vacation period, the big event this summer will be the district convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Because there are many things that can occupy our time, we need to be careful to maintain a good routine of spiritual activity. Do not let spiritual things take a secondary place. Endeavor to use your summertime opportunities well. Your doing so will contribute to greater joy.—Phil. 3:16; Matt. 5:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The apostle Peter was a busy person; he lived a full life. Although he felt pressures of life and experienced problems caused by opposers, he knew ‘that seasons of refreshing come from the person of Jehovah.’ (Acts 3:19) He agreed with other Bible writers who showed that our drinking in God’s Word and associating with giving truth to the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” “The pictures hold our son’s attention while we read to him,” writes a parent. “We are amazed at the way the pictures vividly recall the stories to his mind.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> “I know that this book was especially made for the younger children,” writes a 16-year-old from Iowa, “and I don’t consider myself a young child. But from the bottom of my heart I can say that next to the Bible, this is the finest book I’ve ever read.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Since the Bible accounts are presented in the order that they occurred, they are appreciated by veteran Bible students. One sister said, “I have such a problem placing people and things in their right place in history. So this book is a real help to me. In our preaching work, we find many older people who are interested in having a book in chronological order. This book fills that need.” Because of failing eyesight, a sister said that the large print is easier to read at night. And she adds, “The basic message of the book—‘If Jehovah says “No!” don’t do it; if he says do something, do it!’—comes through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1) </span><span class="font6">our brothers bring refreshment. (Rom. 15:32; Ps. 23:2, 3) And it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘doers</span><span class="font6"> of the will of God who will be happy.’ (Jas. 1:25; John 13:17) These verses emphasize the importance of keeping Jehovah first, keeping well fed spiritually, associating with our brothers and being active in Jehovah’s service if we want to enjoy the greatest refreshment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> With this in mind, make it a practice to share in field service with your brothers on the first Sunday of each month. Endeavor to hold to this good pattern during the spring ana summer months. Some families have arranged their affairs to spend some time together in the service at least one day each week. If your family does this, we encourage you to hold to such a good routine. Will you or another member of your family, with your encouragement, be able to spend some time in auxiliary pioneer work this summer? How fine it is</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>1980 &quot;DIVINE LOVE&quot; DISTRICT CONVENTIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">The quality of divine love tends to draw us closer to Jehovah, his Son and one another and ever strengthens our resistance to separation. We trust that this same attraction will draw us to attend one of the 102 “Divine Love” District Conventions for the United States, hold us in attendance from beginning to end and leave us with reluctance to see it end. Not one of us can afford to miss a single session. The opening talks on Thursday set the stage for what is to follow, helping us to catch the spirit of the whole convention. \luch information has already been given to help us with our plans to attend. The February 1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> listed the 102 convention locations and dates, and the February </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font6"> provided helpful information as to where it is recommended each congregation attend as well as explained a new approach to finding rooming accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our exemplar, Jesus Christ, taught that there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving. (Acts 20:35) It is good, therefore, that we give attention to what we can </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font6"> at conventions as well as to what we will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">receive.</span><span class="font6"> To that end we are providing the following information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM: </span><span class="font6">“Who is wise? He will both observe these things and show himself attentive toward Jehovah’s acts of loving-kindness.” So says the psalmist at Psalm 107:43. Such attentiveness means focusing our mind on the things being presented, together with a receptive attitude. The word attentive also carries with it the thought of being conscious of the comfort of others, being courteous. Therefore, we must be attentive not only to the things presented from the platform, but also to the needs of others. In the first century many sought front seats for greater honor. Such seats are now desired by many not for honor, but simply to minimize the distractions from the program sometimes caused by unnecessary noise, some walking about or other acts of thoughtlessness on the part of fellow attenders. Christian love will prompt us to listen carefully to all that is presented from the platform as well as to train ourselves and our families to do nothing that will unnecessarily distract those seated around us. Since habits cultivated at our local meetings will manifest themselves at our conventions this summer, why not begin working now to improve in this matter of attentiveness where we see the need for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSIC: </span><span class="font6">Special music for listening and for audience singing has again been prepared. Singing is a fine way of giving expression to what is in our heart. We encourage you to participate wholeheartedly in singing Jehovah’s praise at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT: </span><span class="font6">True Christianity is a way of life, not simply something to which we belong. When we as Christian witnesses of Jehovah convene in large numbers, the demonstration of Christlike qualities contributes to a powerful witness. Our conventions are often widely publicized so we have an excellent opportunity to let our fine conduct glorify God. (1 Pet. 2:12) Guard against anything that would cause the way of the truth to be spoken of abusively.—2 Cor. 6:3; 2 Pet. 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much good counsel was given on the matter of maintaining honorable conduct while attending conventions in the April 1978 and May 1979, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font6"> It would be good for you to review this information by way of a reminder. One of the objectives of our assembling together is to ‘encourage one another.’ At one time or another, have you not been favorably impressed and encouraged by the conduct of fellow Witnesses in contrast with that of people in general? It may have been their kindness and patience while waiting in line, their consideration of others in traffic, the chasteness and modesty reflected by their dress as befits holy people, the genuine respect shown parents and other older ones, the loving and persistent training of youth, the kind expressions of appreciation for service rendered either by fellow Christians or those of the world, and so forth. On this latter point, for example, although it is a personal matter based on circumstances, recognition of the custom of tipping certain hotel, motel and restaurant personnel can greatly affect our reputation with worldly ones who provide us with various services. The world takes things for granted and is basically self-centered. True Christians are not that way, but, rather, take the lead in “showing honor to one another,” treating others as they would like to be treated themselves.—Heb. 10:25; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16; Rom. 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One area that continues to need attention is the matter of the excessive saving of seats. Various approaches have been made to deal with this problem, but nothing substitutes for the basic Christian quality of love in this matter. When arranging for conventions, the Society tries not to fill </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> facility to its absolute capacity so as to allow for some extra room. Of course, circumstances sometimes arise that affect this, but we are pleased to see that the majority of our brothers are able to cooperate very well with the recommendations as to where to attend. So, brothers, it may be good for each one of us to review his attitude toward this matter of seating at conventions. We may ask ourselves: Do I always seek out the preferred sections in which to sit, or if my health and circumstances permit, do I sometimes choose to sit in upper sections or those more difficult to get to so that older or newer ones are not inconvenienced? Do I spread out my belongings on adjoining seats causing others to think that they are occupied? Would it not be considerate to remove my articles from seats not actually being occupied at least 10 or 15 minutes before the session begins, so that others are not inconvenienced by having to unnecessarily search for seats or place attendants in the awkward position of having to remove the articles themselves? Do I keep my family together or know where they will be sitting so that family members are not reserving seats for each other needlessly? Do I yield graciously to the direction of attendants in this matter of seating? Is the same diligence exercised in saving a seat displayed in rqy effort to occupy that seat from the beginning of the program to its conclusion? Am I ‘inciting to love and fine works’ in this matter of seating?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL AFTERNOON FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font6">Over 46,000,000 people live in the immediate vicinity of the 102 &quot;Divine Love” District Conventions in the United States. What better way would there be for us to display our loving concern for these millions of individuals than by putting forth a real effort to share the Kingdom message with them as part of our convention activity? To that end, Friday afternoon has been set aside for special field service. Since the program is scheduled to conclude by 1:00 p.m., it should be possible for those in attendance to get something to eat at the convention site, get organized into groups and be in the field by about 2:00 p.m. Various features of field service will be arranged and it would be most fitting for elders and ministerial servants to serve as captains of groups. Each one should bring a witnessing bag and current magazines together with his Bible. Anything additional, along with further details about the afternoon’s service, will be announced at the convention. We feel confident that the content of the morning’s program will make you eager to share in the field activity Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font6">The readiness and willingness of Jehovah’s people to perform necessary tasks, often of a menial nature, has favorably impressed many. The same volunteer service arrangement as outlined on page 5 of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font6"> insert for May 1979, will be used again this year. This is a system where those caring for departments or other duties invite individuals to assist them, often utilizing the circuit assembly organization, as well as arranging various groups of volunteers through the congregation’s convention coordinator. Real effort is being made to limit work to what is necessary, and so you can be sure that if you are asked to help or are included in a group of volunteer workers, you are doing work that is needed and very much appreciated. A Volunteer Service desk will be in operation at the convention where last-minute volunteers can report and be directed to the department needing help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font6">For youi<sup>-</sup> convenience, food and drinks will be provided similar to last year at every convention. Most will no doubt appreciate this provision since many will be staying overnight where there are no kitchen facilities. It is good to know that our brothers will be lovingly preparing suitable food at all the conventions to <sub>z </sub>care for our needs during the day. Of course, just as was experienced by Jesus on more than one occasion, the feeding of large numbers of people sometimes results in surplus because we do not want any to have to go hungry. (Matt. 14:14-21) We are grateful for the help of those who understand this and have purchased these food items to take along with them at the conclusion of the convention. Food quantities are figured largely on expected attendance, feeling that most will take advantage of the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once again the $1 convention tickets in 10c segments will be used at the conventions for the purchase of food only. These tickets will be made available to your congregation by the convention organization a number of weeks in advance and you may purchase them through the congregation at that time. It is suggested that you make this advance purchase of enough tickets to supply your own or your family’s needs for two or three days of the convention. Your cooperation in this' respect is appreciated, not only because it reduces the amount of money handling required at the convention, but also because it eliminates the congestion and inconvenience of long lines at the cashiers on the first day. These tickets may also be used for the purchase of surplus food, if available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We look forward to the good things that Jehovah has in store for us in connection with the “Divine Love” District Conventions and trust that the information here provided will assist you in making your plans to attend. Your diligence in this regard will certainly bring a rich reward from our loving God, Jehovah.—Heb. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">District Convention Reminders</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font6">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Form has been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the Special Needs arrangement you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon request, available information on any commercial trailer and camping facilities in the convention area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font6">At most locations, the immersion will be on Saturday. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the 80 questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font6"> book with the elders prior to the convention. Bathing suit and towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font6">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be at 9:50 a.m., on Thursday and Friday and at 9:30 a.m., on Saturday and Sunday. The same qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 4:50 p.m., on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service and so the sessions will conclude by 1:00 p.m. On Saturday the closing song and prayer are scheduled at 5:00 p.m., and on Sunday at 4:40 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GILEAD AND BETHEL MEETINGS: </span><span class="font6">A meet</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">ing will be held on Thursday at 1:00 p.m., for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday at 1:00 p.m., for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and would like to enter Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font6">All </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font6"> pioneers will need to bring their Pioneer Identification and Assignment card to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention are entitled to receive food tickets upon presentation of their Identification and Assignment card at one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Literature will be available to pioneers at pioneer rates at the bookroom. All traveling overseers and those in Bethel service will receive a special identification card (CO-57) for obtaining their convention tickets as well as any free releases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font6">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please wear the lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. You should obtain these through your congregation. You will note that the lapel card has been designed to such a way that it may be used again for circuit assemblies until next summer. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font6">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> times and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font6"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Happy Full-Time Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font6"> When you talk with those who are or have been to the full-time service, It becomes apparent that this activity has been rewarding for them and that their memories are happy and satisfying ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a After a fine month in the service, one mother with two children wrote: “I just wanted to thank you for the best month that I can recall. When the auxiliary pioneer arrangement was introduced, I was overjoyed because now I can auxiliary pioneer every month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">s A brother who was recently married and is a regular pioneer with his wife said: ‘‘My wife and I want to tell you how much we have enjoyed being in the pioneer service!” A wife wrote: “For the past two years my husband and I have enjoyed the full-time service as regular pioneers. It has served as a great protection for us as well as given us a very rich, full life. Perhaps one of my greatest joys is to be able to share to the pioneerservice with my husband. It has been such a fine way to begin our marriage, drawing us closer to one another and to Jehovah. The rewards are uncountable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup>A pioneer husband and wife said: “Jehovah has richly blessed us. We are able to care for our two teenagers. Really, our pioneering has aided them to be more spiritual minded. They are both going to be baptized at the summer assembly and join us by auxiliary pioneering to July.” What a rich blessing for parents to have!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> One pioneer wrote, saying: “I planned to auxiliary pioneer for one month, which I did. But I found so much interest that I couldn’t stop. I had to keep pioneering to look after all the interest and to conduct the studies.” Another pioneer said: “My greatest joy is finding interest and then conducting Bible studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup>A sister, a widow, 61 years of age, after five years of full-time service said: “I am so thankful to Jehovah for this short period of time. These past years while pioneering have brought so much happiness and contentment, I just had to tell you. I pray that I can continue as long as there is work to do. I cannot really begin to name all of the blessings and joys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' Are you one of those happy pioneers? Then you know what these brothers and sisters are talking about. Many who are now in the pioneer work or who have been in the past have said: ‘I used to hear the exuberant expressions of appreciation from those in full-time service—pioneers, missionaries, members of the Bethel family and traveling brothers and sisters—but it was pot until I got into the full-time service myself that I really understood what they were talking about.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">s Perhaps you could be one of those happy pitftleers —even temporarily. Many have auxiliary pioneered for a month or more. Last year 17 percent of the publishers in the United States, over 100,000, shared in this activity. Were you one of them? In some congregations over half of the publishers have succeeded in arranging their affairs to share in the auxiliary pioneer work. This has been true especially where elders and ministerial servants have taken the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a Many young publishers who are out of school for the summer are planning to auxiliary pioneer for one or more months. Are you planning to do this too? Perhaps you can share in this activity when your circuit overseer visits the congregation. Many brothers and sisters who are now serving at Bethel, in missionary work or other branches of full-time service first served as auxiliary pioneers and then took up the regular pioneer work when they completed their schooling. Is it your goal to serve your Creator in your young manhood or womanhood? (Eccl. 12:1) Can you serve as an auxiliary pioneer or begin to serve as a regular pioneer this summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">io Those who are in the pioneer service are not there because they have nothing else to do or no other responsibilities. They are there because they choose to be. This service was one of their goals; it was high on the list of their priorities. Full-time service is not always easy. However, the blessings are rich and the satisfaction of serving Jehovah in this way is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ii Those of you who are members of a family and are in full-time service are to be commended for arranging your schedule to have a share in this work. And you other members of the family who have cooperated by sharing in necessary work at home and helping in other ways to make it possible for a member of your family to be in the pioneer service are to be commended too. By your support you show you appreciate the importance of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">12 It may be that you are not able to be in the full-time service now, but you would like to be. Perhaps it is your goal to serve as a missionary or at Bethel some day. As you reach for your goal, we encourage you to attend the meetings at the district conventions for those who are interested in Bethel and missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ii The circumstances of many of our dear brothers and sisters do not permit them to be in the full-time service. Nevertheless, it is obvious that they, too, are happy in Jehovah’s service. How generous Jehovah has been in making it possible for all of his people to be happy in their service to him no matter what their circumstances in life may be.—2 Cor. 8:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ii However, if you are one who enjoys the privilege of sharing in some feature of full-time service, we know that you have often thanked Jehovah for your blessings. We are glad to assure you that we appreciate what you are doing and you can be sure that Jehovah does too. —Heb. 6:10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>BETHEL SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The same zeal that motivates Jehovah’s people to increase their share in the activity of preaching and conducting Bible studies also stirs those whose circumstances allow them to volunteer for service at Bethel, the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It is here that the production of the printed page, used in the spreading of God’s message earth wide, originates. That the printing and production of printed material has been closely linked with the spirit of evangelism from very early times in Christian history is borne out by one statement made by the Supreme Court of the United States: “The hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism—as old as the history of printing presses.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(.Murdock</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania,</span><span class="font6"> 319 U.S. p. 105)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible also places special emphasis on the use of printed material in getting the preaching work done for those of us alive in “the last days.” The book of Revelation, the 9th chapter, verses 16 through 19, describes 200,000,000 colorful horses with heads of lions and tails of serpents. Out of their mouths fire and smoke and sulphur issue forth and their tails are like serpents. What do these two hundred million horses symbolize? They picture the Bibles, Bible-study-aid books, booklets, magazines and tracts that tell of the destruction to come upon Christendom in God’s day of vengeance. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(fm</span><span class="font6"> p. 244) This publication of Bible literature is under the direction of the anointed remnant. What a tremendous privilege to have a share in the production of these “horses” and to work alongside the brothers of Christ in fulfilling their commission.—Matt. 25:37-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another prophecy undergoing fulfillment in our time is that of Ezekiel 34:11-14. “For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: ‘Here I am, I myself, and I will search for my sheep and care for them. According to the care of one feeding his drove . . . And I will bring them out from the peoples and collect them together from the lands and bring them in onto their soil and feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the stream beds and by all the dwelling places of the land. In a good pasturage I shall feed them.’ ” How true it is that Jehovah is providing an abundance of spiritual food for his people through the various publications. We are indeed enjoying “good pasturage”! In addition to that, how evident it is that many of us as well as our friends, neighbors and family members have been directed to Jehovah by this same means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What can you do to have a share in this grand work of supplying the spiritual food to your brothers around the earth under the direction of the “faithful and discreet slave”? If you are a baptized male between the ages of 19 and 35, spiritually and physically strong, and able to serve at Bethel, have you given thought to availing yourself of this facet of full-time service? Occasionally there are openings for single or married brothers even though they are over 35 years of age. Such ones are encouraged to apply if they have a trade, specialized skill or professional training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you are not yet of age what can you do? Since it is the same Interest in getting the good news preached that moves some to engage in the pioneer work, it would be a fine step for you to be an auxiliary or regular pioneer in preparing yourself spiritually for Bethel service. Those who serve at Bethel do so not because they have less love for God’s work in the field. Rather, it is a love of God and man that motivates them to take up and continue in Bethel service. They, too, engage in actively preaching and conducting home Bible studies. Pioneering will also help you to learn to lead a more disciplined and organized life that is vital for successful and happy service at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As parents and elders we can do much to encourage younger brothers to make Bethel service a goal. In the world today financial security is of chief concern to most people. As a result, much stress is placed on higher learning and job opportunities to accumulate material things and make for a comfortable life in this old system of things. However, one elder wrote this to a young man after telling of some who put emphasis on gaining of a lot of material things: &quot;However, you, O man of God, flee from these things. But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper. Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.” (1 Tim. 6:11, 12) Really, it comes down to a matter of faith in Jehovah’s ability to see that his servants would not be lacking if they put his interests first in their lives. In fact, he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wants</span><span class="font6"> his servants to put him to the test in this regard and to look to him as one who rewards those who seek to please him.—Mal. 3:10; Heb. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For those who are in a position to serve at Bethel now, what a wonderful opportunity to express your love for Jehovah and to be of service to your brothers world wide. Jesus showed that those involved in this spirit of giving would gain true happiness. (Acts 20:35) If you desire to apply, write to Watchtower Society, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, Attention: Personnel Committee, asking for an application. You, too, will find the joy that comes from expending yourself in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Marvelous Instrument </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font6">loud enough even for old ladies to hear.” Older ones appreciate it, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PRESENT IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> How can the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font6"> book be presented effectively? Much depends on you and how you feel about the book. Why do you feel it is of value? With conviction and enthusiasm tell others how you feel about it. It was prepared primarily with young people in mind, but with a choice of language that also appeals to many adults. So we should not hesitate to present it to all age groups.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Since summer vacations are approaching, it may be that young publishers can take the book to school and offer it to schoolmates for reading during their vacation. In normal conversation with another student you might say: “What will you be doing during the summer vacation?” (Allow time for answer.) Depending on the answer, you could say: “We are going to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in [name the city] for four days. [Allow for response.] At one of the conventions a couple of years ago we got a book that was really interesting to me.” Show it to the student. Suggest he might like to get a copy and read it during vacation time. Perhaps you will present it a different way. But remember, if you can show a person what </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font6"> like in the book, the same point may interest him too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Or when talking to householders, after introducing yourself, you could say: “We are sharing something that many people truly appreciate. It is this beautiful publication, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.</span><span class="font6"> Probably you have wondered about the answers to questions such as these.” Then turn to Part 1 and read the first paragraph under the heading “Creation to the Flood.” Thereafter, draw attention to the pictures in Stories 1 and 2 on the following pages and make appropriate comments on them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>9</sup> Another presentation which has been successfully used is similar </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6"> the one found in the August 1979 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font6"> You might say: “Good day. As a neighbor of yours it is a pleasure to bring you good news. Most of us have experienced the loss of a close friend or relative in death. Perhaps you have wondered what has happened to such ones and also if there is any hope for them.” (Allow for response.) Turn to Story 92, pointing out the picture that shows what Jesus was doing. Then read the last paragraph in the story. Conclude by saying: “This publication is de-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Use Your Gifts Well</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> How does Jehovah feel about your faithful heartfelt service? He generously rewards those who extend themselves in serving him. Past history of faithful men and women verifies this. Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3; Rom. 4:3), Rahab (Josh. 2; 6:25; Matt. 1:5) and Phinehas (Num. 25:10-13) were among those who received such rewards.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Abraham, Rahab and Phinehas are remembered for their acts of faith and obedience. Is this not what Jehovah expects of us? Yes. And, how thankful we are that Jehovah is a God of appreciation. Whatever gifts we possess and use in properly serving Him are acceptable. Notice was taken of the widow who could only give two small coins. (Luke 21:3) The requirement in ancient Israel for sacrificial gifts to Jehovah was according to what a person was able to give.—Deut. 16:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Likewise, today, we all possess different abilities that can be used in telling the good news to others. Our circumstances in life differ and this, too, affects how much we are able to do. As in the past, it is not always great things that individuals do that accomplish the preaching and teaching. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 13:10) Rather, in cooperation with the whole association of brothers, it is our willing and diligent use of what we do have that counts. Our using to the full the gifts we have, combined with the activity of all our brothers, brings rich rewards-from Jehovah’s hand. This has been our experience in serving Jehovah, has it not? So, we have reason to appreciate how signed for young and old alike, to help us all better appreciate the love and concern that God has for us. We are offering it on a contribution of $2.00.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> While we will be featuring the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font6"> book in our field service during the month of May, it may be good for us to carry other publications that we can offer to householders if they decline the current offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Many parents have found </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font6"> helpful in teaching and discussing the truth with their children. Have you been reading it with your children? We encourage you to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> Truly our thanks go to Jehovah for providing us with such a marvelous instrument that we can use in aiding all kinds of people. —Matt. 9:36-38.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah uses our abilities, whether small or great, to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Some do very well in store-to-store work or street work. Others have had excellent results in house-to-house work. Informal witnessing is a field in which much good is also being accomplished. Share to the extent that you can in any and all of these privileges. Use your gifts well, whatever they may be, as you work closely with your brothers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>s</sup> For example, one older, foreignspeaking couple does especially well in the magazine work from house to house. They place hundreds of magazines a month. As they return with new magazines from week to week, they take particular note of those who snow interest. To help cultivate much of the interest they have found, others in the congregation have used their gifts in making return visits and starting studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Continue to develop your abilities in presenting the good news in various ways. As long as we live, there will be more to learn as well as opportunities to make progress. As you strive to improve your abilities, do not become discouraged if you cannot do as well as others in some feature of service. Rejoice in what you are able to do and use your gifts well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah finds pleasure in his servants who are happy and rejoice in doing his will. So let us continue to offer ourselves willingly in his service and find delight in using our gifts to Jehovah’s honor and praise.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Unsolicited Correspondence</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Some brothers and sisters are receiving letters from individuals in other countries whom they do not personally know. Many of these people claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, but often they have been found to be impostors, seeking to take advantage of the brothers for personal gain. Such correspondence may ask for material or financial aid, as well as Bibles and literature of the Society. It would be advisable for anyone receiving such correspondence to forward it to the Society’s office in Brooklyn, and it will be either handled or forwarded to the appropriate branch for attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is always good to be alert to the activities of impostors, whether they be in our own country or elsewhere. Your cooperation in this regard will be very much appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Can we help these people? Thanks to Jehovah and his organization, we can.

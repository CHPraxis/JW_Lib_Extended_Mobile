<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 1980</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 23, No. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dear Brothers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No doubt all of you are concerned about whether there are any of our brothers and sisters among the more than 115,000 Cubans who have recently arrived in the United States as refugees. Yes, about 3,000 of our brothers and sisters were taken to the different camps in this country and they are being processed by the immigration authorities. More than 1,000 of our brothers were among the many thousands transported to Miami, Florida, where the Orange Bowl football stadium was used as a temporary site for the refugees. The rest are distributed in other camps set up by the government. Efforts are now underway to register and settle our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society immediately sent some funds to be used to aid the brothers. Additional contributions have been provided to benefit them. Congregations from Tampa to the Florida Keys have contributed some 15 tons of clothing and more than two tons of food have been donated locally in the Miami area. Our brothers from Cuba are in good spirits and are using every opportunity to spread the good news among others in the camps. Reports tell us that their conduct has been exemplary. Many have suffered much persecution in Cuba, but they are of good courage and are determined to continue walking in their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are saddened to report at this time that five members of the Bethel family, and a few others in the New York city area have recently been disfellowshiped. There has been some apostasy against the organization ana the promoting of sectarian divisions in some of the congregations of God’s people. (Titus 3:9-11) Living as we are in times difficult to deal with, it should not be surprising that such things occur. The first-century congregation also experienced deviations as we well know from our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Working What Is Good Toward All</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses are known as hard workers. But we are not the only people who work. There are many who no doubt work just as hard as we do. When the long workday ends, many persons of the world may be just as tired as we are. A housewife may burn up as much energy during a morning’s shopping trip as a Witness does in a morning of field service. A family man tinkering with his car may exert himself as much as the brother who labors over his upcoming public talk. Even a long trek to the Kingdom Hall may not exceed in energy a family’s weekend drive to the country.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AVOID VAIN WORKS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Yet our efforts in connection with pure worship are infinitely more valuable than any other work that could possibly be done. Why? Because we “work what is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">good.” </span><span class="font11">(Gal. 6:10) The non-Christian may work himself into a state of exhaustion in efforts to benefit his fellowman. He may be motivated by noble ideas and goals, and yet often be “striking the air,” as it were. (1 Cor. 9:26) Whatever good he accomplishes may be shortlived. We, on the other hand, know</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Working What Is Good Toward Younger Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has always been concerned about those who are oppressed. (Ps. 146:7-9) In ancient times he made special provisions to insure that even younger disadvantaged ones were cared for. His law to Israel made particular mention of the “fatherless boy.” (Ex. 22:22-24) While we are not under that ancient law today, does not the principle of that law place a responsibility on us as Christians?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In some congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, there are what we might call “fatherless” young ones. This could be because they have unbelieving parents. Other youths have believing parents who may need help in giving spiritual assistance to their children. It may be that the parents are quite new in the truth and not in a position to help their children effectively, as they would wish. With pressures of various sorts making increasing demands, some may have difficulty in scheduling sufficient time to study with their children or work with them in field service, and so forth. Other parents, although desirous of giving the needed assistance, find themselves in need of help in sounding down the truths that our deeds in Jehovah’s service are not in vain.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> But how do we “work what </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font11">good”? A brief look at the context of Paul’s words to the Galatians is quite revealing. A number of Christians there, formerly holding to the Jewish faith, were laboring in vain. They had not fully accepted the undeserved kindness through Christ. Thus they still tried to prove themselves righteous by works of law. These Christian “Judaizers” promoted circumcision and holding to the Mosaic law’s dietary restrictions. Paul endeavored to show that such works of law are vain, and that salvation comes only through faith in Christ, —Gal. 2:16; 3:10-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The letter doubtless did much “good” in readjusting the Galatians. It encouraged Christians to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) Here Paul may have had in mind helping Christians to place their full faith and confidence in Christ, thus living according to the direction of God’s spirit. What work could have been more productive or satisfying?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued dn page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">from God’s Word into the minds and hearts of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN YOU DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A question that all in the congregation can give serious thought to is: “How can I provide help and encouragement that is needed?” Those having assignments on the meetings can include younger ones from time to time. Could a wider variety of young ones who are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">exemplary</span><span class="font11"> in the congregation be used on meeting parts? (Acts 16:1, 2) While some may not be as gifted as others in expressing themselves, granting occasional privileges will be encouraging to them as well as to others. It may take more time to help some, but this training, experience and attention will pay off in rich dividends as our conscientious youngsters grow in the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Parents have the God-given responsibility of helping their own children. But does this mean that others cannot assist? Not at all! And this is especially true where some parents are having difficulty as already mentioned. Children who want additional help may be invited to join your family in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Following the Master's Example</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus loved people. This was evident in his life course while on earth. He talked to people everywhere—on seashores ana hillsides, in cities and villages, synagogues, marketplaces, streets and houses. He talked to large crowds, individuals, men and women, old and young, rich and poor. He knew that the message he carried was vital. It was life sustaining.—John 3:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’Are we following the Master’s example today? Happily, many are! We have seen fine results during the service year now ending and this is due to much hard work, along with Jehovah’s spirit ana blessing. However, it is good for us to continually examine Jesus’ example and see how he cared for the responsibilities that were entrusted to him. Jesus commissioned his disciples to do the same work that he nad done while on earth. —Matt 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Jesus was self-disciplined. He had personal organization. He was dependable. (Luke 21:37, 38) In order for us to get the most done, we too need personal organization. We should be dependable and to a Certain degree follow a personal schedule.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">‘Jesus also experienced tiredness, thirst and hunger at times. He would occasionally forgo food for the sake of the work to be done. (Matt. 21:18; John 4:6, 7) Are we self-sacrificing in our service? Are we desirous of reaching reasonable goals that we have set for ourselves? Jehovah is not asking us to be ascetic, but how can Jehovah’s spirit strengthen us if we never</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">. . . Younger One* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">study, field service and perhaps wholesome recreational pursuits. Does not the apostle’s encouragement to “widen out” apply in this regard?—2 Cor. 6:11-13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Even those who are not parents can “widen out” in the affection they show to younger ones by spending time with them. Giving of themselves will help to encourage and strengthen younger ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> You may be able to utilize opportunities available before and after meetings to talk to younger ones. This should be more than a “Hello” and “How are you?” One elder asked a small boy how he was, but before the child could answer, the elder turned to speak to an older brother he wanted to see. Later the little boy came up and asked the elder: “Do you </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font11"> want to know how I am?” The elder confessed that he learned from this experience. give of ourselves to the point that we need his help?—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Jesus showed affection and friendliness to strangers as well as to his intimate followers. (Matt. 11:28-30; John 13:1; 15:11-15) When we see the suffering that people are experiencing now, both physically and mentally, are we prompted to share our hope with them? Can we see fully the importance of the work that we have in spreading the good news of the Kingdom, knowing that this is the only hope that these folks have? Also, does our love for our brothers prompt us to show them love, overlook their mistakes and idiosyncrasies, just as we would want them to do for us? Are we following the Master’s example?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Jesus took his assignment seriously. He was considerate and thoughtful of others, taking into account the limited understanding of his audience. (Mark 4:33) Do you take special care in preparing for field service? Do you practice what you want to say? Have you found the suggestions in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> to be helpful? Are you trying to reach the heart of individuals as Jesus did when teaching others?—Matt. 7:28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Jesus’ perfect example of humility ana kindness should be reflected by all Christians. Our endeavors to continue to serve faithfully in the work that he has assigned will bring us contentment and the joy of helping others. Most of all, it will bring praise to our heavenly Father and his Son, our Exemplar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Younger ones respond more readily when they are known by name. Yes, they too are a part of the congregation and older ones should establish a rapport with those younger members. When the younger ones come to view you as their “friend” there is a more ready response to counsel and direction, is there not?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A LASTING IMPRESSION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Many of you can no doubt look back ana vividly recall some small privilege given to you when you were quite young. It was encouraging and appreciated, was it not? What was it that impressed you? Was it a small part in a demonstration? Some kind word of counsel or commendation given by an older one? Perhaps a field service experience shared while working with an older brother or sister? By viewing all in the congregation as part of a large congregational</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">. , . Good Toward All </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Christians today also need encouragement from one another. We could miss the purpose of God’s undeserved kindness by thinking that salvation can come from following a particular rule of conduct. The pressures of this system of things could influence us to lower Christian standards of morality, or vainly strive for material security. All of the brothers are therefore to be commended for what they are doing on behalf of one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEANINGFUL WORKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> A recent example of this is seen in the fine response of the brothers to the Society’s admonition to ‘Help One Another.’ Brothers have taken the initiative to invite “fatherless boys” to accompany them on Bible studies. Sisters have been helping other sisters who must endure difficult domestic situations and who are in need of encouragement. This is meaningful work! Much is being done to help our brothers ‘walk by spirit.’ True, this takes extra tune and effort. It can be tiring. But it is worth it. Is it possible that you could do more toward helping “those related to us in the faith”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Also, let us not forget those in our territories to whom we owe the ‘debt’ of sharing the good news. (Rom. 1:14, 15) Many people are working harder than ever before, just to make ends meet. Those without the good news need to know how to direct their efforts toward attaining salvation. Much literature has been printed by the Society to help them. If your congregation has a stock of older publications, would it not be wise to get these books into receptive hands where they can do much good? This month we will offer two of our older 50-cent publications. Why not arrange to help out in the field this weekend?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> While we do not have a monopoly on hard work, it certainly is satisfying to realize that what we do accomplish can have such, a lasting effect. Let us continue to work at “what is good” for the spiritual well-being of both our brothers and those of the world who have yet to taste of the true liberation that Christianity brings. —Gal. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“family,” there will be many benefits to young and old alike. As we endeavor to imitate Jehovah’s example in showing interest and affection to all of mankind, let us continue working what is good toward our younger ones.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Seldom-Worked Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our Lord, Jesus Christ, directed that the good news should be “preached in ALL the inhabited earth ...” (Matt. 24: 14) It is for this reason that we should put forth extended efforts to help people who live in seldom-worked territory. Can we give them additional opportunities to hear and be saved?—Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps your congregation has distant territory that is seldom worked. It is recommended that territory be covered at least once a year. If your congregation is unable to do that, could another congregation close by be of assistance? The circuit overseer is aware of your needs due to his reviewing the territory records when he visits. He will do what he can to arrange for help from nearby congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, are there nearby parts of the congregation’s territory that may ifot be as productive as other parts? These could include affluent areas where little response has been seen over the years. Also included would be highly religious communities where opposition has been experienced. However, although there have not been “many of noble birth” who have responded since the first century when the Christian congregation was established, there have been some. Even some of the Jewish priests responded favorably. So, we do not want willingly to ignore any territories. We want to preach to all kinds of men.—1 Cor. 1:26; Acts 6:7. (See also Acts 16: 6-10; 18:9-11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WAYS THIS CAN BE DONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Service overseers can encourage and help organize the coverage of all the congregation’s territories. Some congregations have organized midweek and weekend groups to give special attention to seldom-worked territory. If you must travel some distance, you may find</span></p>

Some plan to take a lunch and spend several hours or the entire day in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Smaller groups of publishers may be assigned to follow through on not-at-homes and for covering sparsely populated areas. This economizes on time, keeps _ all in the group busy and minimizes needless waiting. When people are not at home in these territories, you can decide if it is practical to leave free literature. Keep in mind that literature should be left out of the sight of passersby. Literature should not be placed in mailboxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> It is beneficial to prepare your presentation in accord with the territory you will be working. Always be warm, friendly and positive. When approaching the affluent, have in mind what would interest them. Grooming, dress and general decorum should especially be given attention. We do not want to give any “cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with.”—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> If opposition has been experienced in the past, you may want to take that fact into consideration in your introduction and in the scriptures used in your presentation, as well as in what literature is offered. We are interested in ‘saving some.’ Let us prepare to become to them whatever will aid to this end.—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Our desire to do Jehovah’s work and a sincere love for all kinds of people will prompt us to preach in seldom-worked territory. (Matt. 5:43-48) If love and sincerity are manifest in our conduct and speech in these territories, some may respond and give glory to Jehovah our God.—Matt. 5:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Beginning with September there will be an adjustment in congregation meetings held during the week of the visit of the circuit overseer. The Theocratic School will be conducted for 30 minutes and will consist of Assignment No. 1 and highlights from Bible reading for the week. There will be no student talks scheduled for that week. There will also be a one-half hour talk by the circuit overseer. The regular service meeting will be conducted for one hour, thus making a two hour meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations may wish to conduct the service meeting first, followed by a song, and then continue with the Theocratic School and the one-half hour talk by the circuit overseer. Alternate arrangements may be preferred by some congregations and this will be left up to them.</span></p>

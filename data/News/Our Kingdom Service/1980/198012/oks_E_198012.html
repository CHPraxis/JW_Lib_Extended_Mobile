<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the first century, the apostles of Jesus spoke God’s word with boldness. They had been instructed about God’s kingdom and the role of Jesus in God’s purpose. They knew they had a responsibility before God to bear witness and they did it boldly. They realized that because of the opposition to the message, they would encounter persecution. Jesus had mentioned to them that they should expect it.—John 15:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Realizing the powerful effect that the message would have upon individuals, the apostles and disciples in the first century risked their lives to get the message preached so that all could hear about Jesus. In Acts chapter four, it is noted that the apostles were very forceful in making their defense before rulers. Realizing the importance of their message, they earnestly prayed to Jehovah to give them strength to continue preaching. Verse 29 states: “And'</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font13">now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.” What then happened? Verse 31 says: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.” What faith!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Their speaking God’s word with boldness did not mean that they became self-reliant, presumptuous or stubborn. Instead, they were motivated by love. They had overcome their fears and had confidence because they knew they were doing God’s will. We need that same boldness today and we can ask ourselves a very important question: Is it characteristic of us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPEAKING BOLDLY TODAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What does it mean to speak God’s word with boldness? It means to be confident, wholly assured that what we are doing is backed up by Jehovah. That being the case, there is a threefold reason why we should be bold: (1) We know what we teach is from the Bible and we know it is the truth;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1981 Memorial Observance</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Memorial celebration for 1981 will take place after sundown, Sunday. April 19. That will be a day when all should be especially Interested in getting out Into the field service and Inviting new ones to assemble with us for that special occasion. Wherever possible, we recommend that each congregation arrange to have the Memorial celebration In its own Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 8. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Each member of the congregation can derive great personal benefit from the congregation book study arrangement. In some respects, it provides benefits that do not directly come through some other provision of the congregation. Why is that so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It is because the congregation book study arrangement not only provides a careful and detailed study of Bible subjects, but also incorporates personal assistance and shepherding benefits, along with counsel, encouragement and direction for carrying out our individual responsibilities in the Kingdom-preaching work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS OF THE BOOK STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Basically, the book study arrangement provides a means for everyone in the congregation to take in vital Bible knowledge. The conductor is himself a student of God’s Word. He is qualified to help each one not only to increase in Bible knowledge, but also to apply it in a practical way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> With regard to our individual effort in connection with the study, the principle set forth by Jesus as recorded at Acts 20:35 applies, namely: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Thorough individual preparation and a willingness to share in the group discussion make for a lively study that brings great benefit to everyone attending.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The book study arrangement is also a means by which Jehovah carries out his promise to render needed personal assistance to all of his spiritual flock. (Isa. 40: 10, 11) The brother assigned as conductor is usually an elder. As a shepherd he is particularly concerned with ‘knowing the appearance of the flock.’ (Prov. 27: 23) As he becomes better acquainted with you, he can give attention to your spiritual needs. His efforts may contribute toward building up your spiritual strength.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Finally, the book study arrangement plays a vital role in advancing the Kingdom-preaching </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

(2) What does the Bible say about “bodily training”? When Is It beneficial? What pitfalls must be avoided? Why is it wise to keep balanced? (3) How can movies and television sometimes serve a useful purpose? When do they become a snare? How could you be influenced toward wrong conduct?

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Cooperating in all these arrangements results in a book study group that is closely knit together. And by doing all things out of love for one another the brothers display the identifying mark of true disciples of Jesus.—John 13: 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> The hundreds of thousands of persons who have come into the truth since this outstanding book was published will especially be strengthened by this information. Indeed, all of us should grow in faith and have our hope strengthened by attending the congregation book study during the year ahead.

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Fulfilling our commission to preach &quot;this good news of the kingdom&quot; despite the economic crisis</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When the disciples were sent out in the first century to preach the electrifying message, “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” they were given some specific instructions concerning financial support of their work. “Do not procure gold or silver or copper for your girdle purses,” Jesus said, “or a food pouch for the trip, or two undergarments, or sandals or a staff.” (Matt. 10:7-10) Their undistracted attention was to focus on spiritual matters, the giving of a thorough witness concerning God’s kingdom. If they put Kingdom interests first in their lives, their material needs would be provided. “The worker is worthy of'his wages.”—Matt. 6:32, 33; Luke 10: 4, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In modern times it has been the same with Jehovah’s people, as the history of the last 100 years shows. Rather than soliciting funds or sponsoring money-making schemes for the building of great cathedrals and ornate palaces for a clergy class, Jehovah’s people have put the emphasis on comforting depressed mankind with the glorious message of God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus—the only ,hope of the world. (Matt. 12:21) This Scriptural viewpoint of priorities was clearly set out in the second issue (August 1879) of the Society’s official publication. There it was stated: “ ‘Zion’s Watch Tower’ has, we believe, Jehovah for its backer, and while this is the case it will never </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">beg</span><span class="font13"> nor </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">petition</span><span class="font13"> men for support. When He who says: ‘All the gold and silver of the mountains are mine,’ fails to provide necessary funds, we will understand it to be time to suspend the publication.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> This policy has served well as our guideline ever since. “Seats Free—No Collections” has always been the slogan wherever we have held our meetings, and Jehovah has added his blessing. In modern times, as in. the first century, our preaching work has been supported in large measure by unsolicited and wholly voluntary contributions. (Rom. 15:26; 2 Cor. 9:13) In this respect Brother Russell himself took the lead. He closed out his partnership with his father and spent his personal fortune of a quartermillion dollars in the Kingdom work. Many other faithful ones with similar devotion to Jehovah followed this example.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLICITY OF THE KINGDOM BY FEINTED PAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* Early Christians were not content just with telling others the “good news” by word of mouth. They set about to duplicate copies of the Scriptures and to distribute them far and wide. More than just making copies of conventional scrolls, those early Christians are credited with producing the Scriptures in codex form, books, if you please, with individual pages for easy reading as opposed to the older and more cumbersome scrolls. Yes, in a figurative sense ‘Christianity went to press’ back there in the first century.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> So, too, in the 1800’s, when the Kingdompreaching work got started, it was not surprising that the brothers began distributing great quantities of the “good news” in printed form. Millions of copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Object and Manner of the Lord’s Return</span><span class="font13"> and other tracts were widely distributed. By 1884 over a million copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Food for Thinking Christians</span><span class="font13"> had been placed with the people, free of charge. The first volume (356 pages) of the “Millennial Dawn” series (later known as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures')</span><span class="font13"> was published in 1886. After that, during the next 40 years, six million copies of these volumes were put out in a number of languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> As the work increased it became necessary to obtain larger quarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (in 1889). This building was known as the “Bible House” and it served as the Society’s headquarters for the next 20 years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> An important feature of the work back there, and one that contributed to the expansion of the Kingdom preaching, was sending out a large number of colporteurs and evangelists with financial support. These are known today as “pioneers.” Then in 1897 the “pilgrim” work began. Those traveling representatives visited the ever-growing number of congregations on a regular basis in order to build up and strengthen their brothers spiritually. Today the same work is accomplished by the nearly three thousand circuit and district overseers; supported, in part, by the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Around the turn of the century foreign branches began to be established in Great Britain, Germany, Australia, and so forth. It seemed advisable With this overseas expansion of the work to move the headquarters of the Society to a seaport city. So in 1909 property was purchased in Brooklyn, New York, and the headquarters were moved there from Pittsburgh.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> A history-making venture in sound/motion pictures got underway in 1912. From January 1914 halls were packed out and crowds were turned away as the completed “Photo-Drama of Creation” began to be shown without charge throughout the world in a number of languages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, DECEMBER 1980</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Several months after it begin showing, World War I broke out in Europe on July 28, 1914. What would this mean for the work of Jehovah’s people? For 40 years the Kingdom message had been preached at a tremendous expense in time and money on the part of Jehovah’s dedicated people. Around 10,000,000 books and booklets and many millions of tracts had ■ been distributed. So the question was, Would this work now wind down and come to an end? The answer was ‘No.’ In fact, the following year, in 1915, during a question-and-answer session in Vancouver,' Canada, Brother Russell said: “There is a gre.at work to be done, and it will take thousands of brethren and millions in money to do it. Where these will come from I don’t know—the Lord knows his own business.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> How prophetic his words proved to be—‘a great work yet to be done that will take thousands of brothers and millions of dollars’!.AndJiow true , his words, “the Lord knows his own business”! For the Lord Jehovah did provide both the thousands of brothers and the dollars—in his due time, of course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> But first, World War I would need to run its course. And in its course fanatical opposition against Jehovah’s people was generated. (Rev. 12:12-14) This resulted in an almost complete halt in the Kingdom-preaching work when the Society’s officers were imprisoned on false charges in a federal penitentiary in 1918.—Matt. 24:9-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">REVIVAL OF THE WORK AFTER WORLD WAR I</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> Following the liberation and exoneration of the imprisoned officers of the Society in 1919, the preaching work was quickly resumed. .Again, the financial policies that had served Jehovah’s people so well as guidelines for more than 40 years were adopted. The attitude was: ‘Since Jehovah is the backer, he will supply the funds for what he wishes to be done now.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Up until then the Society had only small job presses of its own. The magazines and books were produced by outside printers. Now it seemed to be Jehovah’s will that a rotary magazine press be obtained so that we ourselves could do the printing of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The.Watch Tower.</span><span class="font13"> With the purchase of that first rotary press, a companion magazine of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font13"> the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font13"> (known today as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!),</span><span class="font13"> started publication. The first issue was dated October 1, 1919. After the transfer of the factory to 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, on March 1, 1922, a second rotary press, a M.A.N. press for printing bound books, was •purchased. In the years that followed, with the ever-greater cry for more books and booklets, the Society bought many, many more rotary presses. This in turn meant the building of bigger printing plants. Also larger housing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">' % __</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">facilities had to be constructed to accommodate the enlarged Bethel families as more manpower was needed to keep up with the increased demand from the field for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">literature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> Looking back, the unfolding of the slogan ‘Advertise! Advertise! Advertise! the King and the Kingdom,’ at the 1922 Cedar Point, Ohio, convention appears to have been the signal for the Kingdom-preaching work to gain added momentum. Soon the regular house-to-house work by congregation publishers was more fully organized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> About the same time the radio began to be used quite extensively to broadcast the Kingdom message. In 1927 Jehovah’s people arranged with the National Broadcasting Company for a chain of 53 stations to broadcast </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font13"> lecture entitled “Freedom for the Peoples.” That was the largest single hookup up to that time. This expense was covered, as the many other expenses of the Society, by voluntary contributions on the part of dedicated Witnesses. The next year another history-making event took place when Jehovah’s people hooked up 107 radio stations for a single broadcast independent of any radio network. That lecture was entitled “Ruler for the People,”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> At this 'time the pioneer work was encouraged and literature provided at a low cost to enable them to be full-time ministers. Are we not glad that now more than 125,000 are in this field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> Another milestone in the expansion of the proclamation of the “good news” occurred in 1937 with the start of the special pioneer service. These brothers and sisters are given assistance with a small allowance. Beginning with a few hundred, the ranks of special pioneers have grown until today there are more than 14,000 throughout the world. (Ps. 110:3; Heb. 13:15) The support of these special pioneers is borne by the Society. But when the results of their faithful efforts and self-sacrificing devotion are taken in,to account, when the lives of thousands of people whom they are able to help toward dedication are weighed, it is worth every penny of the contributed dollars that has to be spent to keep these special pioneer ministers in the field!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> It was in the midst of World War II, in 1943, when Jehovah put it into the minds of his servants to open up the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Since then more than 5,800 missionaries have been trained and sent out to the ends of the earth. These missionary ministers entered many lands where there were few, or even no, Witnesses. Now there are many thousands of our brothers and sisters in those places. These faithful missionaries have had a very large part in gathering together a “great crowd” of more than 2,000,000 persons, speaking some 170 languages and living in more than</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">200 countries around the world. Here is evf-dence indeed that,Jehovah has blessed the contributions given by our brothers. By this means, the Society has been able to support these faithful brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> This is a question often asked by people of this materialistic world. It is no secret. Some of the printing and shipping costs are covered by the contributions received for the literature placed in the field. But monies from this source nowhere near cover the Society’s expenses in this inflationary age. These expenses are not just those involving presses and literature materials (paper, ink, cover stocks, shipping costs, and so forth) but they also include the allowances of ’ the special pioneers, missionaries, members of Bethel families and circuit and district overseers. Also high costs are • involved as new facilities, new equipment and improved technology are required to continue the expansion of Jehovah’s work. Were it not for the additional voluntary &gt;&nbsp;contributions made by Jehovah’s devoted Witnesses and other individuals it would be impossible to finance the forward movement of this mighty witness throughout the earth in these “last days.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> We are reminded of a time in the past when God’s devoted servants built in the wilderness the tabernacle around which the worship of Jehovah was centered. Jehovah’s people only had to be alerted to the need and they voluntarily contributed more than enough gold, silver, cop-/ per, precious stones and other valuables so that the project could be completed. There was no coercion, no raffles, no bingo games, no bazaars or other money-raising schemes employed. Rather, as the record at Exodus chapter 35 shows, the compelling force of' Jehovah’s spirit acted on the dedicated minds and hearts of the people. The invitation was extended: “Let every willing- -hearted one bring it as Jehovah’s contribution.” (Vs. 5) What was the response? The account tells us: “Then they came, everyone whose heart impelled him, and they brought, everyone whose spirit incited him, Jehovah’s contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.” (Vs. 21) “Every man and woman whose hearts incited them to bring something for all the work that Jehovah had commanded to make by means of Moses did so.&quot; —Vs. 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> Some 475 years later Jehovah put it in David’s heart to build a magnificent temple to Jehovah’s praise atop Mount Moriah. Again the invitation was given: “Who is there volunteering to fill his hand today with a gift for Jehovah?” In reply, “the people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah.” The gold alone that was contributed by David himself and by the people'would amount</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">at today’s Inflated prices to something over $7,000,000,0001—1 Chron. 29:5-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>23</sup> In giving such voluntary support, did the contributors take credit to themselxfes? Far from, it! Note David’s praiseworthy attitude. He said: “Who am I and who are my people, that we should retain power to make voluntary offerings like this? For everything is from you [Jehovah], and out of your own hand we have given to you. . . . O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name, from your hand it is, and to you it all belongs. And I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, ... I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things, and now your people who are on hand here I have enjoyed seeing make offerings voluntarily to you.” —1 Chron. 29:14-17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">INFLATION—ECONOMIC PLAGUE ON THE WORLD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> What is the economic situation as we enter the year 1981? Within a short period of time prices of all types of commodities have skyrocketed far beyond the gloomiest predictions of astute economists. The price of gold soared from' a mere $35 a few years ago to as much as $800 an ounce. In the U.S.A, gasoline has gone from around 30 cents a gallon to $1.30, while in some countries it is $2, $3 or more a gallon. Air fares have doubled and quadrupled. A ride on the New York subway costs 12 times what it did 32 years ago, and soon may go higher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>26</sup> This galloping inflation has affected practically everything that is needed in a material way to preach this good news of the Kingdom. A case in point: Paper that cost $35 a ton before World War II is now nearly $500 a ton. Postal charges for magazines, and shipping costs for books, are soaring higher and higher. Why, in many countries around the world the Society now runs its own trucking service to the congregations in order to keep magazine costs down within the reach of all classes of persons who so much need the Kingdom literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>26</sup> With this inflation, there must be some increase in allowances to assist the special pioneers and missionaries in their assignments. Similarly the allowances given to the thousands of members of the Bethel families around the world have been increased several times over the past 30 years to help them keep decently equipped and to care for their transportation to meetings and service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DOES INFLATION AFFECT OUR WORK?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>27</sup> How do we keep the preaching of the “good news” going to all nations? Where does the money come from in order to cover these rising costs of printing and distribution? Well, Jehovah has multiplied the number of his Witnesses many times over during the past 40 years, and with their increased inflationary wages many of them, in turn, increase their unsolicited and voluntary</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">contributions. Jehovah’s people today have the same loving devotion and dedication to his worship and service that they had when the tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple on Mount Moriah were built. To be sure, not all are able to contribute the same amount, nor is there a tithing system in effect Rather, as among first-century Christians, their contributions are “according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.” Yes, “if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable” in proportion to how Jehovah blesses each one. —2 Cor. 8:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> Because of this Bible principle we find that much of the financial support of the worldwide witness work has come from the brothers in the more affluent nations of the world. Yet, for the most part, the greatest increases in publishers are not in the financially prosperous nations but, rather, among the underprivileged peoples who have little material means.—1 Cor. 1:26-29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> Not surprisingly, it has become increasingly difficult to cover the increased cost of paper and shipping and other enormous inflationary costs just from voluntary contributions. Hence, the brothers as well as the public need to contribute more toward the cost of the literature. It is no longer possible to place our bound books on the contributions Of former times. It has become necessary to increase these rates to offset to some extent the decreased purchasing power of money.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>30</sup> Other economic measures have also been taken by the Society in an effort to combat inflation. As much as we dislike using paper and other materials of lower quality, this has been necessary to some extent under the circumstances. Also the Society has recently purchased offset presses, which cut down on the percentage of waste paper due to their more efficient design. By converting to computerized phototypesetting we will also be able to cut both platemaking and manpower costs. These projects have been expensive initially, but in the long run they should prove economically sound investments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>31</sup> Some branch homes and factories around the world are overcrowded and badly in need of being enlarged. Some building programs have gone ahead, but it has been necessary to postpone others because of soaring construction costs in the past few years. Similarly, money has not been available from the Society for building Kingdom Halls as previously, but it is hoped this will be only temporary.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL INFLATION STOP THE WITNESS WORK?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>32</sup> Should the long-standing financial policy of the Society be changed or abandoned in order to cope with the world’s economic crisis? We think not. We believe the policy is as sound today as when it was first published more than 100 years ago, namely: “When He who says: ‘All the gold and silver of the mountains are mine,’ fails to provide necessary funds, we will understand it to be time to suspend the publication” of our books and magazines. We are absolutely convinced that this is not the work of any man or group of men. Rather, it is Jehovah’s work under the direction of his beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>33</sup> Inflation may call for adjustments but it will not hinder Jehovah’s work, so long as it is His will that “this good news of the kingdom” be preached. On the other hand, by viewing the short supply of money as a challenge, we are attempting to be realistic and to use practical wisdom in tackling the problem. (Prov. 3:21-23) We believe the Lord’s people should likewise view the problems of inflation that they are facing in their individual lives. They should not be unduly anxious as worldlings are who say, ‘What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to wear? Or where are we going to live?’ Never will Jehovah’s people have to beg for bread, if they seek first God’s kingdom and his righteousness. (Ps. 37:25; Matt. 6:31-34; Luke 21:28) At the same time they should be frugal with their money. They should see where they can cut down spending on unimportant things, avoiding always the spirit of the materialistic world, in order to have money for the necessities of life as well as for things pertaining to the Kingdom and a furthering of its interests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>34</sup> As economic conditions continue to worsen around the earth, Jehovah’s people worldwide are indeed to be commended for their generosity and for their support of the Kingdom work, both by their loans and by their contributions. They contribute not only for the building and upkeep of their local Kingdom Halls (and in some areas their circuit assembly halls) but also'for the construction of new branch buildings and the purchase of new printing presses and other equipment. More than that, they often contribute toward relief work when disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes strike our brothers in various parts of the world. A recent example of generosity in behalf of distressed brothers was the assistance given in providing for and resettling some 3,000 brothers who came from Cuba to the U.S.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>36</sup> Though some contributions are very small, like the needy widow’s “two small coins of very little value,” yet in Jehovah’s eyes they are of great value. They add up like many drops in the proverbial bucket to fill it to overflowing to Jehovah’s praise.—Luke 21:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>38</sup> As economic conditions in the world continue to worsen in these “last days” we look to Jehovah for continued guidance and direction of the witness work yet to be accomplished. May He continue to supply all the funds necessary and may He give his faithful servants the wisdom from above in their discreet expenditure of the same. May this be to the praise and glory of Jehovah the God who can more than superabundantly supply all that i!s needed for completing his witness work within the allotted time!—Eph. 3:20, 21.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Are We Making the Best Use of Magazines?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">'We must acknowledge the tremendous good accomplished by our magazines over the years. All of us have benefited in a multitude of ways from the information presented in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> The widespread recognition given them confirms their impact on the public. Not long ago a letter was received from a professor of sociology commenting on an article in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> that he found particularly interesting. He said: “It was the most scholarly analysis of the ‘disco’ movement that I had read.” A medical doctor commented: “While waiting in a hospital lobby, I got impressed with your magazine </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> and decided to have it every month on a membership basis.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> You may have noticed, however, that in recent years there has been some decline in the number of copies of the magazines printed and distributed. Is this decline because the articles are less informative, less spiritually upbuilding? Has the format become less appealing? Has the capacity for production been reduced? We must agree that the value, appeal and availability of the magazines have all increased. Why, then, the decline?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Though we continue to use the magazines, it is clear that less is being done in distributing them to the public. Some may feel they are designed specifically for Jehovah’s people and have only limited value to the public. The response shown over the years confirms that people from all</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep on Speaking . . . </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">(2) we know that we are doing a work that Jehovah wants to have done and we have the backing of his spirit; and (3) genuine love moves us to show our devotion to Jehovah and to extend help to our fellowman in this way.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Because of the apathetic attitude of people today, sometimes we meet up with indifference in preaching from house to house and also informally. What should we do? We should continue to boldly preach the good news. We may be tempted to hold back when we encounter indifference, but by doing so, we would not be following the example of Jesus and the apostles to speak God’s word boldly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> In Noah’s day, there was indifference and ridicule. We are told to expect similar attitudes today. Noah had a reputation as “a preacher of righteousness.” walks of life regard them as a genuine source of comfort. Neglect of public distribution may rob people of their only means to hear the Kingdom message. Appreciating *their value to ourselves and others, we have good reason to search out ways to increase distribution locally.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Do the following questions give you some ideas on now to increase the distribution of the magazines to those with hearing ears? (1) Do you have a regular order for a sufficient quantity of each issue? (2) Are you magazine conscious, alert to offer them regularly? (3) Could you start a magazine route? (4) Could you plan to use some service time just for magazine distribution? (5) Have you tried using the article “Have You Ever Wondered . . . ?” in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> as a means to stimulate interest?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> There may be other ways that you can increase distribution in your local territory. Much depends on our, personal appreciation of the contents of the magazines. Are you reading the magazines regularly and getting the benefit you should from them? One can hardly be stimulated to share the magazines with others if he knows nothing about what they contain. Surely the current cost of 10c per copy is very reasonable and with each of us making more of an effort, the distribution of the fine information in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> can be made available to the people in our territory. May Jehovah bless the effort that we put forth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">(2 Pet. 2:5) We need to speak God’s word with boldness. By doing so, we demonstrate our faithfulness to God and love for neighbor.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> During December we are presenting the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font13">and the new book released at our “Divine Love” District Convention entitled “Happiness—How to Find It.” By preparing well we can boldly declare God’s name and kingdom to people in our territories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> As we get deeper into the time of the end, our determination should be to continue telling out the good news and sounding the divine warning.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Happiness—How to Find It </span><span class="font13">—what an interesting subject to discuss with people we meet in field service during the month of December! And what a marvelous book to offer along with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> By now most of you probably have read the new book we received at the “Divine Love” District Conventions last summer. It may be that you already have in mind a number of talking points in the book. Also, your own personal interest in this new book very likely has moved you to offer it to friends, relatives and especially to interested persons who, were unable to attend the convention and get their own personal copies there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The book is designed to appeal to persons of many different interests and backgrounds. This should be obvious from the very title of the book, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness—How to Find It.</span><span class="font13"> Who doesn’t want to be happy? How many people are desperately in search of happiness today and yet find that it eludes them at every turn?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Just a brief examination of the contents of the book shows that there is something in it for everyone. It should appeal to those who have no particular religious background as well as those who profess a firm. belief in God. By becoming familiar with the various chapters in the book, you should be able readily to select one with appeal for whatever type of person you meet.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Chapters one through four should prove to be most helpful in presenting the book to persons who are not religiously inclined. These chapters appeal to reason and avoid being dogmatic. Even persons who are generally apathetic about spiritual matters may be intrigued by the content of these first four chapters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Chapters five through 10 show how practical the Bible can be in resolving problems of daily life, with such interest-arousing titles as ‘‘Money Problems—What Help?”, “Sex—Which Advice Really Works?” and “Better Health and Longer Life—How?” Then chapters 11 through 20 deal with fundamental teachings of the Bible, but often from a fresh standpoint that most readers should find stimulating.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFERING THE BIBLE AND &quot;HAPPINESS&quot; BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> During December we will be offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font13"> along with the» </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font13"> book on the contribution of $3.10. If you wish to feature the Bible as you call on people in their homes, the current Topic for Conversation will lend itself well to making the presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> If you should wish to feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font13"> book, after introducing&quot;-yourself you may wish to say something like this: “Everyone alive really wants to be happy. But genuine happiness is so difficult to find. Why do you think that is so?” (Allow householder to comment.) Then proceed: “There have been quite a number of serious studies made in recent times researching the subject. Some of these studies and their conclusions are commented upon in this book and are presented along with parallel comments from the Bible showing how to find true happiness.” Then you might choose to refer to an appropriate point in the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Or 3 direct presentation can be made by briefly stating: “You may have heard at some time or other the expression, ‘Happiness is where you find it.’ But I am sure you will agree with me that such reasoning doesn’t really help too much when we all find so much unhappiness in the world today.” (Allow householder to comment.) “The Bible promises happiness to those who make the effort to apply its righteous principles in their lives. You know, quite a number of modern researchers and professionals in the field of human relations are in full agreement with what the Bible counseled long ago. For example, . . .” (Cite point previously selected that you think may appeal to the householder, such as pages 58-61 or 65 and 66.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question ($ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is It proper to study or associate with dlsfellowshiped persons?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Individuals get together to study the Bible they do so for the purpose of learning more about true worship and Its blessings. Their coming together also Involves a mutual interchange of encouragement for the purpose of Inciting one another to “love and fine works. (Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10:24, 25) This constitutes part of our effort to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) An Invitation to another to study God’s Word is actually an invitation to “let us exalt his name together.”—Ps. 34:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are rules to govern the conduct of members of “God s household” that must be observed by all. (1 Tim. 3:15) The disfellowshlplng of an Individual actually constitutes his expulsion from the &quot;brotherhood,” and members of the congregation are directed to “quit mixing in company with anyone </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">called a brother&quot;</span><span class="font11"> who is a deliberate wrongdoer. (1 Cor. 5:11) Further, Paul asked: “For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? . . . what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” (2 Cor. 6:14, 15) So, in view of this counsel, it would not be appropriate to conduct a Bible study with a dlsfellowshiped person, nor to associate with him. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font11"> book, pp. 171-174.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What steps can a dlsfellowshiped person take toward possible reinstatement? Such a person seeking help may attend meetings open to the public. If he gives evidence of a genuine desire to pursue a right course, the elders may feel It would be justifiable to talk to him privately, giving exhortation from God’s Word In a corrective manner, which might move him to abandon his wrong course. This would not be conducted in the form of a Bible study; rather, it would be a matter of simply offering admonition directed toward his spiritual readjustment.—See’ August 1, &nbsp;1974, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, pp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1981 Memorial Observance </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font11">rather than meeting jointly with one or more other congregations. Separate meetings provide better opportunity for new ones to meet the local brothers. including the elders and ministerial servants. In turn, they can be given better attention by the congregation. We know, of course, that there are some situations where inadequate facilities or other problems make it necessary to arrange things differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is also good to arrange for a qualified elder to give the Memorial talk. Instead of the elders simply taking turns giving this talk from year to year, we feel the importance of the occasion dictates that one of the more capable speakers, anointed if available, be used and he should put extra effort into his preparation so that the discourse will be clearly understandable and motivating. We believe that this will contribute much toward achieving the maximum In spiritual benefits for all assembling for this special observance. ■</span></p>

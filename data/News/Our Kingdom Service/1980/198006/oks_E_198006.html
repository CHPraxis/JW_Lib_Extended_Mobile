<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping a Balanced View of Our Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Spiritual balance is a desirable Christian quality. Being balanced means we are able to weigh or compare the relative weight, force, importance or value of something. With balance, we can avoid the pitfalls, extremes and mistakes that adversely affect our service to Jehovah. It comes as a result of acquiring the wisdom taught by Bible principles. (Prov. 2:10-15; 3:5, 6) Study and application of such principles help us to develop “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) A person who has acquired good spiritual balance as a Christian strives to demonstrate moderation, modesty, patience, selfcontrol, discernment, faithfulness, endurance and dependability in all that he does. Such a person usually gets more done, finds greater joy in his service and will endure despite difficulty. All of us do well to cultivate this fine quality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">STRIVING FOR BALANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> We often find individuals involved in secular work to the point where they maintain only a token share in field service. What is the purpose of secular work? (1 Tim. 5:8) What would give evidence that we have become unbalanced?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefits of Group Witnessing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Do you often work alone in field service? Very few of us do. It is more encouraging to have someone either working with us at the door or working in the same territory. As one publisher remarked: “Just knowing that there is someone close by helps.” Starting out in field service with a happy group makes service all the more enjoyable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Group witnessing is not new. Luke chapter 10 relates to us the joy that the disciples experienced when working together. It should be noted that before sending out the 70, Jesus first gave them instructions. From his example we see why it is good, in most cases, to meet together prior to going out in field service.—Luke 10:1-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Recently in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font1"> there was a series of articles explaining the importance of helping one another. Are we still putting these fine suggestions into (Luke 12:18-21) What is the proper viewpoint? (Matt. 6:31-33) How can we keep a balance between secular and spiritual responsibilities?—! Tim. 6:6-8; Heb. 13:5, 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Today’s society puts much emphasis on entertainment and personal pleasure. If not careful, we too could be affected by this influence and become excessively involved in such pursuits. Is it wrong to enjoy ourselves? (Eccl. 3:12, 13) When have we gone too far? (2 Tim. 3:4) What principles can help us decide what type or amount of entertainment is appropriate?—Phil. 4:8; 1 Tim. 4:8; Eph. 5:15, 16; Luke 8:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Many problems are being experienced in caring for the spiritual and physical needs of the family. A father may be very active in preaching the good news while his children’s conduct is poor at the Kingdom Hall. Or a wife who is meticulously concerned about the physical appearance of her home shows only a minimal regard for the spiritual needs of her family. What two basic responsibilities are involved? (Eph. 6:4; Rom. 10:10) Why should concern for the spiritual interests of the family rate high on the list of priorities?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">practice? As an “association of brothers,” we all want to help one another. (1 Pet. 2:17) Reports show that in many congregations there is a good response to the special arrangements for field service on the first Sunday of the month. Some elders say that this arrangement has drawn the congregation closer together. Where morning meetings are held, some publishers bring their lunch and then go out in field service before returning home. We are happy to receive these fine reports. They should encourage all of us to continue taking advantage of local arrangements for group witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Meeting together for field service and working with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">group </span><span class="font1">give us the opportunity to work with new publishers as well as those who are more experienced. Elders and ministerial servants can get better acquainted with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18 mln: </span><span class="font11">Song 9. Convention coordinator reviews information from previous letters, as well as appropriate information on pages 31 and 32 of the May 15, 1980, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> on the &quot;Divine Love” District Convention. Also Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Showing &quot;Divine Love.” Encourage congregation to take advantage of informal witnessing while traveling to and from the convention. Is preparation important for Informal witnessing to be successful? Why? What literature would be good to take along? Demonstrate: (1) Witnessing to a gasoline station attendant and/or a waitress, (2) another situation appropriate for your area. (See the January, 1980, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> for additional Information on Informal witnessing.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 min: “Keeping a Balanced View of Our Service.&quot; Discuss article with congregation highlighting principles in scriptures cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Review field service arrangements for the weekend. Song 27 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">8 min: Song 20 and local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Getting the Most from Our Bible Reading. (To be handled by school overseer.) Family group on stage discusses their study needs. All agree that they have been negligent about weekly Bible reading assignment. Different family members volunteer variety of excuses. The father acknowledges that all have busy schedules and need to be determined to stick with a practical weekly schedule. Second Timothy 3:16, 17 is read and the question is asked: How important is it for us to read the Bible? All agree that it has many far-reaching benefits and is well worth the time. How can we Include It In our schedule? A portion could be read at mealtimes. Eliminating Just one half-hour TV program a week might be enough. Any other suggestions by the family are discussed. (Chairman Interrupts to discuss with the audience sug-§estions they may have. Then asks au-lence how they have benefited from regular reading of the Bible. Comments from the audience could Include new things learned, such as greater appreciation for Bible truths, more insight Into the meaning by understanding the context, better clarification of Bible principles and their application, and so forth.) Family expresses their determination to keep up with the Bible reading, not just out of a sense of duty, but because it Is enjoyable and rewarding. It serves for their spiritual upbuilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on article “Step Over Into Macedonia and Help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: &quot;A </span><span class="font11">Good Report.” (Prov. 25: 25) (To be handled by the secretary.) Joy and encouragement were experienced when many new ones first joined the Christian faith. (Acts 4:1-4) We too are encouraged by their service reports. Our reports likewise bring praise. (1) What good results has the congregation experienced In helping those who attended the Memorial? What is still being done? (Inviting them to the district convention, and so forth.) (2) Discuss congregation report. Commend the congregation. Mention any problems congregation may be having in reporting field service.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Group Witnessing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">brothers and sisters while working with them in the field. It affords a fine opportunity for all to share in encouraging one another.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Meeting with the group need not take much time. Usually groups can be organized and started out in service within 10 or 15 minutes. The service overseer should be alert to help brothers overcome problems with organizing the groups so that more time can be spent in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Group witnessing can also be arranged during the week. Many of the sisters are taking advantage of this. Also, most of the pioneers are out in field service on weekdays. By working with the pioneers you will receive encouragement and, in turn, you can be encouraging to them. Youths, now that school will be closed for the summer, why don’t you plan on spending some of your vacation time sharing in this midweek group witnessing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Some have commented that there is an increasing number of people that are not at home during the week. We encourage you to continue keeping accurate house-to-house records so that either you or those who engage in field service during evening hours or on weekends can try calling on the not-at-homes. With the coming of </span><span class="font11">18 min: “Presenting the Good News— With Magazines.” Questions and answers. Highlight our Scriptural responsibility to keep declaring the good news at every opportunity. Point up value of using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> whenever possible. (As time permits. Include several brief and practical demonstrations on most effective ways magazines can be placed in varied situations in your local territory.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font11"> mln: Song 33 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 mln: Song 14, Theocratic News, Question Box and local announcements. 15 min: &quot;Benefits of Group Witnessing.” Questions and answers. Also Include comments from audience as to why they enjoy group witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">&quot;Beware of Imputing Wrong Motives to Others.” A warm, kind talk given by an elder. Material taken from April 1, 1980, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> pages 12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 mln: Interviews on how some came into the truth. Use variety showing how the truth has appeal to (1) younger ones, (2) older folks, (3) family groups, and (4) one whose mate did not approve of associating with the Witnesses. If needed, see </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index,</span><span class="font11"> under heading “Field Service” (experiences).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 56 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the summer months, would it not be good to make definite arrangements for evening group witnessing? Some of the elders and the ministerial servants may be able to meet with the group on an evening that would be convenient for the congregation. Since evenings generally seem to be the best time to find people at home, service overseers should explore this possibility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> We want to reach as many people as possible with the good news while there is still time available. So, where conditions permit, some publishers may wish to work alone. In other areas, going to the doors alone may not be advisable. Or, a married couple working together may be more effective in talking to people. Also, when young ones are in the group, it may be wise to have an adult publisher work with each child. In every case good judgment coupled with a desire to accomplish the most good should govern the arrangements we make.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> We wish to commend all of you for the fine work that you have been doing in the preaching activity. We are seeing good increases in the number of new ones sharing in the work and this makes us all happy. May Jehovah continue to “send out workers into his harvest.”—Luke 10:2.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Step Over info Macedonia and Help&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup>Most of us are familiar with the above-quoted words and the circumstances that surround them. (Acts 16:6-10) Paul and Barnabas loved people. Their willingness to give of themselves was evident by their actions. We see that same willingness among Jehovah’s servants today. (Ps. 110:3) Many of you have moved into congregations so that you can help in working seldom-covered territories and be a source of encouragement. We are sure that, like Paul and Barnabas, those who have done this have been richly blessed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> We should not think that moving to serve where the need is greater is only for elders and pioneers. Oftentimes the Society receives letters from circuit overseers and congregations requesting families to move in to add support, as well as help in working territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The right motive is most important in deciding to make a move to serve where the need is greater. Our reason for moving should be one of wanting to be of help. A brother, who with his wife and son has spent many years serving in congregations needing help, commented that it is often necessary to lower your living standards. “Don’t try to change the congregation to suit your personal likes,” he said, “but work with it, relying on Jehovah for work, housing, and so forth. Be willing to accept what He provides.” Good suggestions!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Also keep in mind that in most areas where help is needed, secular work is often scarce, the cost of housing and other basic necessities may be expensive or weather conditions could be extreme. Much prayerful thought should be given before moving. Count the cost. (Luke 14:28) It is important to turn to Jehovah, as a family, asking for his direction and guidance. And it will be important for each member of the family to support the arrangement. Are you willing to make sacrifices and adjustments in your lives?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> What should you do if you decide to move to a new congregation? First, review what is stated in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font1"> book on pages 134 and 135. Then write a letter and give it to the service committee. They, in turn, will send it to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> In addition to what is mentioned in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font1"> book, please let the Society know if you have in mind a certain part of the country where you would like to serve. We will send you names and addresses so you may obtain additional information you need by writing directly to the congregation (s). It might be mentioned that Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington have a limited need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> There are a number of foreign language congregations that have needs. If you can speak another language and are in a position to move, please correspond with the Society, as indicated in paragraph four, and tell us which languages you speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> With the remainiii^ time of this old system running out, how good it is if we can be of help to our brothers and other honest-hearted people who are still thirsting for the truth. Our prayers are with you in this important matter. May Jehovah provide his guidance as we all work in boldly preaching the good news.—Acts 4:29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Balanced View &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1 Tim. 3:4, 5; Prov. 10:1) What good benefits result when parents are well balanced?—Prov. 24:3, 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> From time to time, some find it difficult to maintain the initiative necessary to share regularly and wholeheartedly in field service. When they do participate, to some extent they may feel that they are forcing themselves. Thereafter they may tend to become discouraged ana frustrated because of what seems to be a serious lack in themselves. Is it something unusual for a Christian to sometimes lack initiative to do the work assigned? (Gal. 5:17; Rom. 7:19, 20) Is a need to force ourselves necessarily a sign of failure? (1 Cor. 9:16, 26, 27) Our service to Jehovah is acceptable if our motive is right. (Col. 3:23, 24) It is appropriate to ask Jehovah for his spirit to help us develop greater initiative to act in harmony with his will.—1 John 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> The key to good balance lies in viewing ourselves honestly, expecting neither too much nor too little. We are balanced when our service is commensurate with our abilities, circumstances and opportunities, rather than judged in comparison with what others do. When we detect a lack in ourselves, a desire to please Jehovah should prompt us to do better. Satisfaction and peace of mind are the result of an inward assurance that we are pleasing Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The Christian congregation has been assigned the responsibility of spreading the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) From its inception, all members were taught and trained with a view to sharing in that work. They all rejoiced when the success of their efforts was reported. “The word of Jehovah went on growing and spreading.” “The word of Jehovah went on being carried throughout the whole country.” “All those inhabiting the district of Asia heard the word of the Lord.” “In a mighty way the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.”—Acts 12:24; 13:49; 19: 10, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> As members of the modern Christian congregation, our assignment has not changed. It is still God’s will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) We have a responsibility to ‘handle the word of truth aright’ by spreading it far and wide, making it available to as many as possible. With the help of Jehovah’s spirit, the honest-hearted ones will be gathered. Today, we rejoice to report that the word of truth is being carried “to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> are playing a large and vital role in getting that done.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINES SPREAD THE TRUTH QUICKLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> A key to success is being able to speak the word “at the right time for it.” (Prov. 25:11) Most people are not inclined to pause and listen when we call, but a magazine left in the home might later be available at just “the right time.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> A college student was impressed by an article he read in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> A return visit the next week resulted in his attendance at a circuit assembly then in progress a</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd the s</span><span class="font1">tarting . </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">o</span><span class="font1">f_a Bible </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">study(</span><span class="font1">One woman slammed the “door in the face of a Witness, but later her husband, who was receptive, accepted two magazines from that same Witness. On a return visit, the woman answered the door, humbly apologized, asked many questions and </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">right away agreed to a Bible</span><span class="font1"> study.] A brother left' some magazines in a car he sold and the new owner later contacted him to learn more about</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">what he hadreadjwhile riding ’tfie'TTain, Someone came across two copies of the magazines. After reading them he wrote for both subscri</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ptions and l</span><span class="font1">ater _began_tn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">study. [</span><span class="font1">Another person explained that sne had visited many different religions to find out what the Bible teaches about hell.

An elderly person found a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> in a stack of newspapers and thereafter searched at great length until she located Witnesses who were ^ble to tell her more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Much thought is given to the contents of the magazines with emphasis on providing information that is </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Scripturallv based, relevant to the times and practical f</span><span class="font1">or cur ‘rent needs.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Appreciating what the magazines can do in helping us fulfill our God-given assignment, should we not look for ways to get more of them into the hands of people who m</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ay be searching for the truth? U</span><span class="font1">t is certainly<sup>-</sup> appropriate<sup>-</sup>to carry them with us in all features of service, offering them to anyone who .might be inclined to </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">read them. ^</span><span class="font1">Placing a subscription may help someone cultivate a </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">growing interest in the Bible-</span><span class="font1">Many publishers have found that&quot; appreciative readers will readily take new issues of_f</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">he magazines on a regular basis.V</span><span class="font1">Those^ whio~em~ &quot;joy doing street work or calling on business people with the magazines report that a friendly, tactful approach elicits good response </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">and resu</span><span class="font1">lts in </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">many placemen</span><span class="font1">ts.

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>ORDER SEPTEMBER TRACT NOW</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The literature offer for September will feature a new &quot;Kingdom News” tract along with a book. Tn past campaigns the Society has printed and snipped tracts at no charge to the congregations. However, due to drastic increases in paper and shipping costs, and the expense of obtaining new printing equipment, it is not possible for us to subsidize the tract distribution this year. Therefore, the congregations are being asked to contribute $3.60 per 1200 tracts. Please determine your needs and order in lots of 1200 using the S-14 Literature Order Blank. Your order should be in Brooklyn by June 6, 1980.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• What should be kept in mind to insure good reading at congregation meetings and who should be used to read from the Society's publications at such meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those assigned to do public reading from the Society's publications such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Commentary on James, Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font11"> and so forth, at congregation meetings should manifest the needed qualities of good readers. These qualities include proper emphasis, sufficient volume, well-placed pauses, correct pronunciation, and so forth. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</span><span class="font11"> pages 30 and 31.) Effective reading on behalf of a group is necessary. Otherwise, those listening will miss the full import of what is being read and will fail to act upon the information. For these reasons those who are assigned to read at congregation meetings should take to heart the apostle Paul’s words at 1 Timothy 4:13: '&quot;Continue applying yourself to public .reading, to exhortation, to teaching.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Elders, ministerial servants and other qualified, baptized brothers should be used when such are available. If no baptized brother in the congregation is able to read in such a way as to benefit spiritually those in attendance, the one presiding may read the paragraphs himself or sisters who read well may be used. Also please see Question Box In the July, 1977, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p>

(Rom. 10:14) Our joy of accomplishment will be even greater if we can help get copies of the magazines into otherwise inaccessible places where their pages can convey the truth “at the right time” and in a manner that will reach honest hearts.</span></p>

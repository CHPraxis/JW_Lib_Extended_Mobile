<p><span class="font8">As is true of you, we here in Brooklyn are keenly interested in our brothers in every part of the world. It is our privilege to supply them with literature, and we are very much encouraged by reports received from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the time that this letter is being written, a number of members of the governing body and their associates are serving at assemblies and visiting branch offices in various parts of the earth: Leo Greenlees in east Africa, Albert Schroeder down the west coast of South America, Karl Klein along the Caribbean coast of Latin America, Milton Henschel in the South Pacific. Lloyd Barry has just left for the Far East, and John Booth will be serving the Mideast and southeast Asia. Others will also be traveling soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently Raymond Franz returned from a zone trip to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile. He reported that the 123 members of the Bethel family in Sao Paulo, Brazil, find that their once-spacious factory and office facilities are now pressed to capacity. Interest in the Kingdom message is great in that part of the field, over 210,000 attending their recent series of district assemblies. The thirty-five missionaries there with whom Brother Franz met have served in their assignments for a total of 476 years—a reflection of the zeal that many of the brothers there feel for Jehovah’s service. In both Paraguay and Uruguay, Brother Franz met many of the friends from Argentina who crossed the border in order to assemble with their brothers in lands where there is greater freedom to do so. Despite changed circumstances in Argentina, they are continuing to press ahead with the Lord’s work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Make the Good News Attractive to Your Neighbors</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It would certainly make us rejoice if our neighbors—people who live on the same street, or who rent apartments close to ours—were to accept the good news. No doubt you have called at their doors when in the field service; perhaps you have also tried to witness to them at other times. Is there anything else that could be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Open your Bible to Hebrews 13:15, 16 and read it carefully. Notice that, in addition to urging us to ‘make public declaration to Jehovah’s name,’ it says: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” Remember, in his parable about the “good Samaritan” Jesus illustrated what it means to love one’s neighbor. He showed that it includes coming to his aid in physical ways when there is genuine need. (Luke 10:25-37) And in his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus made it plain that such kindnesses were not to be reserved only for those who happened to be “nice” to us. (Matt. 5:43-48) Do we keep our eyes open for opportunities to apply this counsel from</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">They Plan ITheir Use ©f Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul urges us to “become imitators of God” by showing love for one another. (Eph. 5:1) We can also imitate our God by showing that we appreciate the value 6f doing things according to a schedule. Are you doing that? Repeatedly, the Bible tells us that Jehovah causes things to take place at an “appointed time.” (Ex. 9:5; Hab. 2:3; Mark 1: 15) He set a definite period during which the good news was carried exclusively to the Jews. At the appointed time, it was extended to the Gentiles. Today, according to divine schedule, the preaching of the Kingdom message reaches around the globe.—Mark 13:4, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses we know the importance of this evangelizing activity, and we all share in it. But those who do it according to a schedule find that they are able to accomplish much more than otherwise. What about yourself? Do you personally have definite times each week when you share in the field service? Or is your participation somewhat irregular, often getting crowded out by other purGod’s Word toward those who live in our neighborhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> They know that we talk about neighbor love, but it means more to them when they see us show it in ways that they can appreciate. When people move into your neighborhood, do you stop by to welcome them? If you know that someone is ill, do you offer to be of help? While we are no part of the world, and we avoid getting involved in its social affairs, we are very much interested in people, and there are many opportunities to show this by acts of genuine kindness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> It may not be opportune to discuss the Bible on each occasion when we extend some kindness to a neighbor. As the apostle Peter counseled Christian wives whose husbands are not believers, there are times when it is better to try to win others to the truth by one’s conduct, without direct preaching. (1 Pet. 3:1) If the conversation opens the way to draw attention to the hope of the Kingdom, do it in a natural way. Do not feel that, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font8"> 7, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3) </span><span class="font8">suits? Would you enjoy more blessings by scheduling definite times for field service? You may be interested in how others arrange their schedule.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">some: practical examples</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Here is what a mother of four and who must work part time says: ‘When my son leaves for school at about 7:20 a.m. I get the housework done and sometimes start supper; then on most days I am ready for secular work or for field service. I also try to get out on weekends so that I can witness with my children. It is best for me to have a definite schedule and be determined to go, barring emergencies, rather than to have a wait-and-see attitude.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> A sixteen-year-old publisher who attends school reports that he too has regular times for field service. How often? At least twice a week for about two hours he is out telling others the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Of course, poor health limits what a person can do. That is true of a sixty-nine-year-old brother</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font16">Song 31. “They Plan Their Use of Time.’’ Questions and answers; read scriptures as time permits. After discussing paragraphs 3-5, interview some local publishers as to their service schedule. When doing this, also bring in the fact that the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font16"> book is the offer for the month; ask what they find to be especially appealing to householders. Outline local arrangements for group witnessing. Then discuss last paragraph of article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font16">“Make the Good News Attractive to Your Neighbors.” Possibly have a husband and wife first </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">read</span><span class="font16"> and then discuss this material together, a paragraph or two at a time. Emphasize what scriptures say. Let them discuss in practical terms how to apply the counsel in their own neighborhood (but not using names).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font16">Enduring When Faced with Indifference. We have been entrusted with lifesaving good news, but Satan wants us to quit our telling others the truth. If not by outright persecution, then by influencing the minds of people so that they are indifferent, he seeks to cause us to get discouraged and slow down. (2 Cor. 4:4 • Mark 4:14, 15) Are we going to let him win out over us? What kind of reaction did Ezekiel and Isaiah meet in their territory? Did they quit? (Ezek. 2:7; Isa. 6:8-10) The situation is similar today in Christendom, which is our territory. Yet some sincere ones do accept the truth, and how glad we are to help them! (Have good local experience related; or use </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ybll p.</span><span class="font16"> 250 f4 to p. 252 1J2.) Conclude with Hebrews 10:36. Encourage full share in field service this week. Song 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font16">Song </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6. </span><span class="font16">Local announcements; accounts report; reminder to turn in field service reports this week, covering first half of month. Questions and answers on article “Can We Reach More People?” Outline any arrangements made locally for evening witnessing throughout the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font16">Branch Letter; then discuss How to Start Bible Studies. Once we find persons who show some interest, we want to help them get the truth into their heart. Have realistic practice sessions with audience participation, showing how to start studies (1) in the house-to-house work and (2) when making return visits. Use local situations arising at doors. Have audience help publishers develop presentation in a way that will really appeal to persons locally. Take it step by step from introduction until consideration of paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">House-to-house demonstration may feature direct approach, such as: “If you have a moment I would like to show you how we learn about God’s good news as we study the Bible and see what you think of It.” After getting householder’s permission, proceed to discuss a Bible topic, using one of the Society’s publications (or just the Bible) as the basis. Keep it informal. Return-visit demonstration can be on person who, although busy, took literature during evening witnessing. Emphasize need to start studies quickly whenever possible to reach person’s heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">20 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font16">Reaching Everyone in Our Congregation Territory. Talk on witnessing in business territory, perhaps reviewing the material in June 1973 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font16"> page 3, highlighting</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font16">need to reach businessmen with good news. Also highlight need of contacting store owners when covering regularly assigned territory before considering territory as completed. Ask: In harmony with Matthew 9:37, 38 and John 3:16, how should we feel about the need to reach everyone with Kingdom message? Comment on how often local territory is covered. Does that mean that we are actually reaching all the people? Why do we want to reach them? (2 Pet. 3:9) Are we taking time to make not-at-home calls? If not consistent about this, what could help us to improve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If truly looking for people, then when interest is found we do not simply read a scripture, place literature and leave. We are looking for these very people! Anytime that is appropriate, anywhere people show interest we take the time to talk with them. Be alert to every sign of interest. In one area where little literature was placed, publishers made a practice to call back on those who were even a little friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As shown by the congregation report, how many return visits were made last month? Are we individually endeavoring to reach people’s hearts? Would it be beneficial to plan to include at least one return visit each time we share in service? How could the telephone be used to make return visits? In what ways would this be effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Discuss with congregation what is being done to reach persons who live in apartments, trailer courts and other difiicult-to-reach places. Here street work can be emphasized, not merely to report time, but to reach people who might otherwise be missed. Instead of simply walking down the street holding up magazines, actively approach people. You may be able to reach certain other persons by obtaining a special mailing permit from the Post Office for a $40 yearly fee, which would entitle you to mail </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">printed</span><span class="font16"> material at the rate of two cents per envelope. If you have fewer than 600 persons to whom you would mail printed material and would mail only once a year, a permit would not represent a savings. If we are all alert to our opportunities, we may be able to reach everyone in our territory with the Kingdom message and thus fulfill our sacred trust. (Prov. 22:29) Song 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font16">Song 48. The Importance of Assemblies in Our Lives. Talk, with audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Regularly we meet in congregation. In ancient Israel, Jehovah also provided for larger assemblies at various times. Today we enjoy a similar provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Draw comments from audience on following points: (1) How was your appreciation for Jehovah’s direction of his people furthered by your attending your first large assembly with Jehovah’s Witnesses? What impressed you? (2) How many of you were present for the following notable events? — Introduction of what has come to be known as the Theocratic School, at assemblies in 1942. Release of the first volume of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font16"> in New York, in 1950. Release of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font16"> book, in 1968 (over a million persons have become Witnesses since then). Outlining of arrangements for congregation elders, in 1971. (3) We can look forward to further rich blessings at the forthcoming district assembly. Don’t miss it! </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font16">Discuss insert regarding district assemblies. Use varied presenta</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">tion (some questions to audience; perhaps group discussion, or experienced publishers answering questions for newer ones). Emphasize assembly that local congregation will be attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font16">Persevering in Efforts to Benefit from Spiritual Provisions. Talk. In the days of Jesus, those who traveled from Capernaum in Galilee went some 75 miles one way, many on foot, to assemblies in Jerusalem. At Pentecost of 33 C.E. persons were present from all the places listed at Acts 2:8-11; compare with map in back of Bible. Earnest efforts are likewise put forth by Jehovah’s servants in modern times. (Cite examples: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">yb76</span><span class="font16"> p. 210; p75 10/22 p. 23; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">g7S</span><span class="font16"> 11/8 p. 19.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Announcements encouraging participation in field service (also ask, Did you turn in your field service report?) and stimulating anticipation for coming meetings. Song 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font16">Song 21. Prayer and Hope Aid Us to Endure. After introductory comments to set the theme, invite audience to read scriptures and to make practical application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not only when at the Kingdom Hall, not merely when out in field service, but at all times we need to conduct ourselves in a way that honors Jehovah. (1 Cor. 10:31) If family members do not share our faith, this is a test. Even the imperfection and thoughtlessness of others in our household can be a trial. Away from home—at secular work, at school, when shopping or traveling—• the selfish, often crude, spirit of the world puts our Christianity to the test. They may even ridicule us for trying to do what is right. How will we react? —Jas. 1:2-4; 1 Pet. 3:1, 2; Prov. 15:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What will aid us to do what is right, even when under pressure? Prayer, reliance on Jehovah. (Rom. 12:12; Col. 1:10, 11; Phil. 4:6, 7) Also, keeping clearly in focus the grand hope that -Jehovah has set before us. (Heb. 12: 1, 2; 1 Thess. 1:3) With the help that God provides, every one of us can attain to the approved condition that results from endurance.—Rom. 5:1-4; 8:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font16">Learning to Converse About Our Hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">(5 min.) Talk outlining some of the principles of good conversation. (See </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font16"> p. 82 fll6, p. 79 114; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">g75</span><span class="font16"> 3/22 pp. 10-12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">(15 min.) Discuss with audience how to converse in such a way that we tactfully give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Mention that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font16">has suggested as a topic for conversation, the question, “Will there ever be an end to violence?” Ask audience: (1) Why would people who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses be interested in that subject? (2) What further tactful questions could you ask to stimulate conversation on the topic? (3) What scripture could we use that would have a direct bearing on the subject? And what comment might we offer on the text? (4) What other informative points could we mention that would contribute to conversation on this subject? (Perhaps include interesting items from “Watching the World,” “Insight on the News,” other news reports; also consider how to go ahead with a more extensive witness if interest is shown.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Now ask the audience to suggest another subject that they feel would be a good topic for conversation with a view to giving a witness. Analyze it </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A</span><span class="font2">RE you completing your plans to attend one of the 109 “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies arranged for us in the continental United States this summer? Truly it warms the hearts of all of us as we contemplate coming together once again in Christian assembly to receive Scriptural instruction and to see how we can improve our relationship with Jehovah. A marvelous program is being arranged and the assembly will be a highlight of our theocratic education this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the opening words of the assembly chairman, throughout each of the four assembly days, the program will be beneficial for each of us. As the theme for the opening day, we will consider “Working What Is Good at Home.” Who is there that cannot think of some aspects of his homelife that he would like to see improved? This program, with much Scriptural guidance for every member of the family, including those in religiously divided households, will offer practical help. To enjoy this day fully it would be beneficial to read in advance the Bible account at 2 Kings 18:1-20:11 and Isaiah chapters 36 to 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The theme of the second day will be “Inciting to Love and Fine Works.” Attention will be focused on Christian love in action. We suggest that you read 1 Corinthians 13:1-10 ahead of time. Timely material is to be presented on the active share that elders will have in the days ahead in inciting others to love and fine works by their shepherding in the congregation. This day will also highlight material from the Bible account at Exodus chapters 5 through 15. Don’t miss it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Exerting Ourselves in the Field” is the theme of the third day’s program. How effective is your field service? Would you like to improve? Helpful information about conversing on the Bible from house to house will be included, along with material featuring the joy we can find in conducting Bible studies. These activities deserve the best that we can give. To share more fully, some are in the regular or auxiliary pioneer service. Are you? Would you like to be? The program will be especially practical for all of you with the pioneer spirit. In preparation for this day we recommend that you read the entire book of Malachi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The theme of the fourth day is “Loyal Workers Inherit the Promises.” By reading ahead of time the material in Hebrews 6:1-3, 9-20 your enjoyment of the morning program will be greatly enhanced. And what is the subject for the public talk? “How God’s Kingdom Can Benefit You.” It is a good subject for all of us, but we will especially endeavor to invite the public and newly interested ones. The assembly will close with comments on what the future holds for God’s people. We urge you to stay to hear it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our hope is that you personally will be able to benefit from all the fine spiritual provisions at the “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies. The following information is being provided to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT THAT HONORS JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only does good conduct make things pleasant for others, but it often serves as a fine witness to outsiders. (1 Pet. 2:12) When we as Jehovah’s people congregate together, what a fine impression of our God others will have if we conduct ourselves at all times in an unselfish, loving manner and take the lead “in showing honor to one another.”—Rom. 12:10; 1 Cor. 14:25; Col. 3:23; John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One such situation that requires consideration for others is that of saving seats. Even though reminders have been given in the past, many have found magazines or other items placed on every available seat in the building, although there w<sup>T</sup>ere far more seats than the number of persons in attendance. This may be due to some using seats for storage purposes, but would it not be much more loving to keep our things under our own seat, on our lap or in the checkroom? In this way brothers will be able to find seats without having to disturb those already seated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In many places it has been observed that large numbers of seats have been saved and were never occupied during entire sessions, forcing people to stand. How would we feel if this happened to us? Jesus stated: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.” (Matt. 7:12) In harmony with this principle, our Christian conscience should move us to consider others. If you need to meet with certain ones for various reasons, why not arrange ahead of time to meet them at a certain time and place before or after the sessions, and then you will not have to save seats for one another. Of course, there may be instances in which you need to save a seat or two for good reason. Families may need seats together; volunteer workers may be coming to sit with their families; individuals may leave for a short time to go to the washroom; also, interested persons may be coming to sit with Witnesses who are encouraging them. So, we need to be loving and balanced in our viewpoint of such matters.—Phil. 2:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At times it has been noted that numbers of brothers have arranged to rush into convention facilities early in the morning when the doors or gates were opened so they could save whole sections of seats, often the choicest ones, by laying magazines and books on them. Such actions certainly do not reflect well upon our Christian personality, do they? How refreshing it is, instead, to see others freely offering their seats to elderly or infirm persons who need them. This loving concern for others truly honors Jehovah, whose loving example we are trying to follow.—1 John 4:8; 1 Cor. 13:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a fine thing for all in attendance to arrange their affairs to be in their seats for the beginning of each session and to remain for the conclusion of the program. Such consideration shows respect for Jehovah’s table of spiritual food. If we are invited to visit someone for a meal, everyone is usually seated and ready when the prayer is given at the start, and no one leaves before the conclusion of the meal with dessert. This should be true at an assembly of Jehovah’s people so that no one inconsiderately roams around the grounds or corridors talking to others during the program, nor should there be a mass exodus before the conclusion of the spiritual program with prayer just to leave ahead of everyone else. Parents can shoulder their weighty responsibility in this by arranging to have their children sit with them and be with them before and after the sessions. This will prevent children from thoughtlessly or deliberately committing acts of vandalism, as has happened at assemblies where children have been allowed to roam freely about the assembly grounds. Many blessings are realized by parents who keep their children with them as loving companions to them at assemblies. The resulting good conduct of our children can bring much praise to Jehovah.—Deut. 6:7; 31:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is also important to remember that not only what we do at the assembly grounds but also our actions elsewhere in the assembly city, where we may stay or engage in recreation, reflect upon our God, Jehovah. Think of the impression we would leave with other guests and workers in motels or hotels if we left food and trash all over our rooms, used the swimming pool after it closes, engaged in loud talking or making of noise in hallways late at night, or even allowed our children to ride elevators for fun, resulting in poor service for others or costly damage. Some have allowed friends who are not staying at the motel to use the pool and other facilities, which the management reserves for only those residing at the motel. These are things that have actually taken place; we need to be mindful of them. Perhaps elders or parents staying at these places who observe such abuses could offer appropriate Scriptural counsel and aid to those concerned, since Jehovah’s name is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By far the majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses, both young and old, at such large assemblies have proved themselves to be fine Christians. Their good conduct is definitely observed by outsiders, as noted from this comment by the director of the convention bureau in an assembly city: “Those in attendance this year, as well as last year, were indeed the finest people who have ever convened in our city.” Much good can be accomplished by all of us reflecting the fruitage of God’s spirit in everything we do. Good manners motivated by love go a long way in enhancing the enjoyment of the assembly for everyone.—Gen. 18:27; 19:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now is the time to bring your plans to completion and make the necessary arrangements to attend. We know you will find it a delightful experience to be there all four days and we look forward to attending the “Joyful Workers” District Assembly along with you.—Heb. 10:24, 25; Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">District Assembly Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOMING: </span><span class="font1">The Society has sent a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation, on which are printed the addresses of the rooming headquarters for each assembly. If you wish assistance in obtaining a room, please fill out a Room Request form neatly and carefully and mail it directly to the rooming headquarters address for the assembly city where you will be attending (NOT to the Society), doing so </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">no earlier</span><span class="font1"> than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly you have selected. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please immediately advise (1) the landlord and (2) the convention rooming department so the room may be reassigned. Some choose to contact hotels and motels themselves and make arrangements, but often more economical hotel and motel arrangements can be made through the convention rooming department. There will be no trailer camps at the conventions, but the rooming department for each assembly will gladly furnish available information on any commercial or other trailer parking facilities in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font1">You may obtain Application for Volunteer Service forms from your congregation. Please fill them out completely and have them signed by your presiding overseer and then send them to the rooming address for the convention city you will attend (NOT to the Society). If you later find that you are unable to serve in your assignment, please notify immediately the volunteer service department at the assembly city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is much pleasure in lovingly serving your Christian brothers as you volunteer individually or as family groups, with even younger ones working along with their parents or older members of the family. It is truly a joy to see so many at Christian assemblies willingly offer themselves to work along with their Christian brothers and sisters of various races and nationalities to care for the assembly departments and the needs of their Christian brothers. —Acts 20:35; Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS: </span><span class="font1">Besides your family, do you have room in your automobile for someone that needs a ride, a pioneer, an elderly brother or sister, or an interested person who wants to attend? It will bring great joy to you as well as to them as you show such loving concern and Christian hospitality to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font1">No doubt all will enjoy wearing the cards as a means to advertise the assembly and to get acquainted with other brothers and sisters in attendance. Field overseers, please have the district assembly lapel cards and holders ordered on the Literature Order Blank right away if you have not already done so. These are cash items. The lapel cards are lc each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font1">At most locations, the immersion will be on Friday. Those who have made a dedication and wish to symbolize this by water baptism at an assembly should cover the eighty questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font1"> book with the elders prior to the assembly. Bathing suits and towels should be brought from home by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font1">Plan to enjoy the entire program, which, in most cases, will begin every morning by 9:25 and will conclude at approximately 5:30 p.m. each day except Sunday. We encourage you to arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to 4:15 p.m. on Sunday, when the convention closes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font1">Why not plan to spend some ji time while in the assembly city engaging in 8 informal witnessing, perhaps on your way to 0 the sessions or when returning to your accom- p modations? Take advantage of every opportu- b nity to speak about the good news and to invite j everyone possible to attend the assembly, es- | pecially those where you are staying. If any handbills remain, these may be obtained at the bookroom and used to aid in such informal witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CLOTHING: </span><span class="font1">As you select appropriate dress for the occasion, keep in mind that the many new ones in attendance have been told that Jehovah’s Witnesses dress modestly, in good taste and avoid the extreme appearance of many worldly people. If they now attend the assembly and find many dressed otherwise, they could be stumbled. If you are doubtful whether some kind of dress would be appropriate, then it is best not to wear it. By following good I standards of modesty you can help to adorn the assembly in a spiritual way.—1 Tim. 2:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font1">Regular pioneers who were appointed on or before February 1, 1977, have been sent a 1977 Convention Pioneer Identification for use at a district assembly during the service year. These were sent by the Society to the presiding overseer of each congregation along with the monthly statement for April. Pioneers, be sure to bring your Convention Pioneer Identification to the assembly; treat it as cash, as no replacements will be available. It can be used to obtain the regular food tickets at the assembly and will also be needed to obtain literature from the bookroom at pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPFUL ITEMS: </span><span class="font1">To enjoy the benefits of the program to the full, plan to take along a Bible, a songbook and a notebook, as well as your copy of this convention insert from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font1">Regardless of the assembly you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk of your car. Also, beware of pickpockets. They often mingle in large crowds. And, for the same reason, do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">TO ASSIST YOU in completing your plans to attend one of the 109 United States district assemblies, the following chart sets out the assembly cities and the circuits nearest to each. To the extent possible, we recommend that you attend the convention shown for your circuit unless vacation plans or other circumstances make it necessary for you to attend elsewhere. In some cases the size of the crowd needs to be balanced with the seating facilities available and so some congregations in those circuits marked with an asterisk (*) may be slightly closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend the assembly indicated so that there will be plenty of room. Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend a particular assembly, such as % or %, and so forth, it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that assembly would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly closest to them, as shown elsewhere on the list. In a number of cities where two or three assemblies are being held in succession, we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> In many places it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach people with the good news. Many are not at home when we call. Do you find that to be true in your territory? What can we do to reach more people with the Kingdom message?—1 Tim. 2:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> For a moment, think about what you customarily do when you are out in field service. As you walk from one house to the next, do you stop to converse with people who may be working in their yards, with men who may be cleaning their car in the street out front, with those who may be sitting on the steps of an apartment house? Or are there times when you find yourself walking past people who are readily accessible and then ringing doorbells at homes and apartments where no one answers? Why not make it a point to converse with everyone who is accessible and thus reach more people in your field service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> When householders are not at home, we probably make note of that fact, but do we persevere in our efforts to reach these people? For example, during the past month, have you spent at least some of your service time in following up your not-at-homes? Is effort made to call a second and even a third time to reach the householder if at all possible? In other words, are we really endeavoring to reach the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">people</span><span class="font8"> in our assignment, or are we simply covering territory?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16">(10 min.) Publisher approaches Bible study overseer, would like to have a study, has not had success in starting one. Together they </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">read</span><span class="font16"> and discuss material under the heading Presenting the Good News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">(5 min.) Encourage all to share in field service this week. Monday, May 30. a worldly holiday, may also be a good day for field service for many publishers. Suggest that those who handle service groups review at their meetings for field service this material from Presenting the Good News. Song 32.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">group visited homes in a certain territory and found very little interest, but during the next week two of the publishers followed up on the not-at-homes and had several fine discussions, placing literature with appreciative householders.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The days are getting longer now, and some of us may be able to take advantage of this for evening witnessing during the daylight hours. This is “prime time” for finding people at home. Often the majority of ones who are not at home at other times can be reached at these hours, and many people seem to be in a good frame of mind at this time of day. Too, you may contact members of a household whom you would not likely find at another time. Some have found they can reach as many people in an hour of evening witnessing as in several hours on a weekend. Of course, evening hours may not be your regular time for field service, but could you make an adjustment if it would enable you to reach more people? The elders in your congregation may be able to arrange for group witnessing on one or more evenings during the week from now until fall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> So, in addition to setting aside time to devote to field service and covering the territory assigned to us, let’s give increased thought to reaching </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">people—</span><span class="font8">sharing the good news with them wherever we find them and on every appropriate occasion.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">rulers, this report was recently received: ‘We are still alive. Efforts are still being made to put an end to our most precious labor to impart hope to the people. They would like to see us dead, but we continue to be upheld by the Almighty, who tells us not to be silent. We obey Him rather than men. The cost is high, but nothing is more important than to serve Him. We ask Him for the strength to endure to the end, and He is responding wonderfully. Ours is the privilege to give to the Father an answer for Satan. We are happy to suffer for righteousness.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May all of us share their love and zeal and reflect it in our service in the days to come. We remember you in our prayers and we send our very warm Christian love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">once you begin, you have to give an entire discourse. Make a statement or two, then pause to see what response you get. (Notice how Jesus did this, as illustrated at John 4: 7-15.) If no interest is shown, perhaps it would be better to wait for another time before pursuing that subject further. But keep your objective in mind; over a period of time you may find that you can accomplish more than if you try to do it all at once.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Some of our brothers and sisters have had fine results while doing this. In New York state a sister says of herself: “I had a desire to have my own Bible study right among my neighbors.” She decided to start off by getting to know them, simply by being friendly. Not right at the outset, but in time, there were openings to give a witness. One neighbor asked what her religion was. Soon a study was started. Others became interested. Three women and two husbands are now fellow Witnesses. Notice that patience was shown; friendly relations were established before she tried to witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Another publisher simply offered some new neighbors the use of her phone until theirs was installed. Not the first day, but in time, the conversation led to a witness about the resurrection. The publisher deliberately kept it brief, not wanting to overwhelm the neighbor with too much all at once. But in a few days the neighbor lady brought it up again. Now a study is being conducted regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> In Ohio, a woman’s leg was broken in an accident. A neighbor, a Witness, kindly cared for her, cleaned her house and cooked meals for her and her family, and, as she did so, she spoke about the Kingdom, when appropriate. The genuine Christian kindness shown moved the woman to have a Bible study. Now she and her three children are doing well in the congregation. Of course, not everyone shown such Christian kindness has become a Witness, but many of them are now much more receptive, because their personal experience has convinced them that Jehovah’s Witnesses really do care about their neighbors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Showing kindness to our neighbors should be a normal part of our lives, not just a means to an end. But if you realize that, in your case, it needs some cultivation, why not make some definite plans as to what you could do and when. It may well be that, “as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses,” some of them will “glorify God.”—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Perhaps I can come by again and we could look up another topic together for, continue our discussion]. Would that be all right?” If the householder agrees, then, depending on what you find to be practical, either suggest a convenient day and time or say: “When I call, if it’s not a convenient time for you, just let me know. I’ll understand. But I do look forward to talking with you again.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Will the householder be glad for you to return? Commenting on an important factor involved, a circuit overseer writes: “Instead of being willing to listen, some publishers want to do all the talking. But by our letting the other person talk, conversation is opened up, and frequently the householder is willing to let us return. It may take more than one revisit in order to turn the call into a study, but it is important to get the person to feeling that he has the right to an opinion. Instead of trying to correct what they say, I try to find points of agreement and then proceed from there.” That is good advice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Another brother says that his success in starting studies is directly related to his attitude when he calls at the door. When he pauses before taking a door and thinks about how precious life is to us and to those who may listen, and prays to Jehovah for his direction, he finds that he expresses genuine sincerity and true love for the people that he meets. To quote him: “I pray very often when out in the service, sometimes before every door.” This brother has outstanding success in starting studies and in aiding persons to make the truth their own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Are you as deeply concerned about each householder as that brother is? Does the person’s life mean enough to you that you would be willing to call on him regularly to conduct a home Bible study? Not everyone will accept your kind offer of assistance. However, if you really have in mind starting Bible studies, you may be surprised to find how often you are able to do just that.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It is often true that the results we get when we call at a person’s home depend on the objective that we have in mind. Of course, there are many householders who simply do not want the good news and who reject it no matter how it is presented. But that is not the reaction that we find at every door, is it? When you find a measure of interest, what do </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font8"> try to do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> If your objective is to place the current magazines or a bound book, then what you say is no doubt slanted in that direction, and when the offer is accepted you are ready to go on to the next door. Much good has been accomplished by the distribution of such literature. But could we accomplish more? Perhaps. In most cases, those who accept literature have had some in the past. They would no doubt enjoy what we have with us today, and we are glad to share it with them. But what they need most is personal attention. They need a home Bible study! How can we help them to see that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Well, if the topic of conversation that you bring up interests the householder, then, instead of simply reading a scripture and offering the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font8"> book, endeavor to do more. First open the book to a point that connects with your conversation and read a paragraph or two. Get the householder’s reaction, but keep it informal. Read together from the Bible any cited scriptures. In other words, where interest is shown, really try to start a study, instead of leaving that for another call. Today the person is at home; today he is showing interest. Who knows when you will have this opportunity again? (With our current “topic i for conversation,” you might start with paragraph 2 on page 106 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font8"> book.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Before you leave, offer the book, if appropriate. In many cases, if sufficient interest has been generated, the householder will already have asked for it.</span></p></li>

And those who really plan their use of time, giving a prominent place to the vital work of proclaiming the Kingdom message, find great pleasure in what they are able to accomplish. —Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p></li></ul>

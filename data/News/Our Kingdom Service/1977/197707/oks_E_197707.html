<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 1977</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 20, No. 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">kingdom ^PMskeKS:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font11"> text that is a favorite among many of us here at Bethel is Psalm 27:4: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Bethel means “house of God,” and Bethel has the largest theocratic family on earth, 1,813 living in Brooklyn and 588 at Watchtower Farms. We have 371 married couples, 1,622 single brothers and 37 single sisters. The oldest member is 88 years old and has been working here for 61 years. Fifty-eight are of the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The 52 kitchen and dining room workers in the Bethel homes prepare and serve over 7,000 well-balanced meals a day for the family, who eat in 10 dining rooms. Most of the food consumed by this large family—milk, cheese, eggs, meat, vegetables, fruit, and so forth —is grown on the Society’s 2,418 acres of land located in New York and New Jersey. Personal services for the brothers also include washing over 67,000 pieces of laundry a week. There are 160 housekeepers to look after the cleaning of over 1,274 rooms. The 1,407 brothers who work in the factory are eagerly looking forward to printing and binding the 23 million books and Bibles they now have scheduled to meet the needs for the congregations and branches for the next six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The family starts the day with an upbuilding, 15-minute discussion of the daily text. Then after working for approximately eight hours in the home, factory or farms, they spend their Monday evenings at a family </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. On other evenings and weekends they are with one of the 312 congregations in the New York city area or rural areas surrounding the farms, attending meetings and participating in the field service and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrating a Superior Way of Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “When we can demonstrate to others that our way of life is superior, then people will listen to what we recommend.” So said an elder who has been in the truth for years and has successfully raised a large family. What do you think were some of the things he had in mind? There are, indeed, many ways in which the Christian way of life is superior, and which, when followed closely, not only will be pleasing to Jehovah but will make a favorable impression on honest-hearted ones who observe. We recommend to others not only the truth, but also our way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CLEAN AND RESPECTFUL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> True Christians follow the Bible’s counsel to be clean both on the inside, in mind and heart, and on the outside. Paul says: “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.” (2 Cor. 7:1) So we should endeavor to be clean not only spiritually, but also personally, in our homes, surroundings and possessions. Our personal appearance is important whether we are at home, at work or in the field service. The favorable comments we hear following our conventions prove this to be true.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">A Full Day in Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It takes effort as well as planning to share in the field service. There are work schedules, the home, family and similar details of life that need attention. Our territory for witnessing may be widespread, involving considerable time and expense in travel. With all that is involved we want to keep in mind the words of Paul: “Therefore, the way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.” (1 Cor. 9:26) So, once out, why not stay out in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> A number of things can be done to get the most out of the effort put forth. For example, meetings for field service can be kept brief and on time. Although some may not have arrived, the one taking the lead could begin the discussion with those on hand at the scheduled time, usually spending no more than ten to fifteen minutes, then leaving immediately after the prayer. Some leave a note so that latecomers can find the group in the territory. If meetings for field service are held following a meeting in the Kingdom Hall, they can be especially brief.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Christians should be respectful. We ought to respect the authority of Caesar and be quick to obey law-enforcement officers and others who benefit the community in helping to make things more safe for alL (Rom. 13:1, 2) We should show respect for others in the community, appreciating that they have rights such as those involving property and personal privacy. Our children are taught to appreciate their schools, striving to learn and supporting the teachers. (1 Pet. 3:15) Older persons both within and outside the congregation should receive due respect.—Lev. 19:32.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GOOD FAMILIES, HONEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* Genuine Christians work to make marriage a success, the husband shouldering his responsibilities of oversight and providing life’s necessities, and the wife giving loving cooperation and Joyal support. They also strive for a happy atmosphere within the entire family circle. (Col. 3:18-21) Children are taught to be obedient, helpful and kind and thus are protected from the rebellious, defiant spirit often seen in worldly children. (2 Tim. 3:1-3) What a blessing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When you make a special effort to reach distant parts or your territory, give particular thought to making the time count. Try to line up the groups so that when the territory is reached, all will be able to stay for about the same length of time rather than having the whole group return because one person has to come home early. Those whose time is more limited could witness in closer territory. It may be appropriate to take a lunch along so that a maximum amount of time may be spent in this distant territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Making return visits requires careful thought too. Groups should be kept as small as practical and those with calls in the same area could be in the same car. Making return visits on the way to ana from the territory will save time. Another time-saver is making personal field service arrangements with those in similar circumstances. These private arrangements give us the flexibility we need in order to fit our personal situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> With all the planning and effort involved in preparing for the public</span></p></li></ul>

Scriptures can be looked up and commented on. as time permits. At certain points in discussion, audience can be aslted such questions as: How does this apply to us? Is there something here that you think we can especially benefit from? Does someone know of an experience that demonstrates the value of this point?

When discussing field service, arrangements for field service for weekend can be briefly mentioned and encouragement given for publishers to support these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Building One Another. Up. It is vital that we take full advantage of meetings and good association so that our spirituality can be kept at a high level. Some publishers occasionally lose sight of the great value of congregation meetings and the need to build one another up bv this and other means. Encourage the brothers in the audience to give heartfelt answers to the following questions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What were some features, guiding principles and purposes of early Christian meetings, and are some of these encouraging things found In our meetings? (1 Cor. 14:26, 33, 40: Col. 4:16)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">Conclude with warm encouragement for all In congregation to be lovingly concerned for the spirituality of others. One thing that we cannot neglect, if we want to make progress constantly and also to have Jehovah’s approval. Is meeting together. (Heb. 10:24, 25) 20 min: Congregation can arrange this part in accord with what Is needed locally. Song 85 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Superior Way of Life </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font11">for congregations that have many such examples!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Christians must be honest. This is true in little as well as big things. One who is dishonest is soon thus identified wherever he is. Borrowed things should be returned and this is best done promptly. Honesty also requires giving secular employers a full day’s work. Jesus said we, should ‘pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,’ and this would include paying taxes even though at times we might think they are exorbitant. —Matt. 22:21; Rom. 13:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> We are not concerned primarily with making an impression on others. We are anxious to please Jehovah. So we remember that we have other important work to do too, namely, to act as illuminators in the world, speaking the goc news to those in our territory ana<sup>1</sup>^ teaching those who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• But we are fully aware that the life one leads constitutes a witness in itself. We must be sure that our way of life is different —that we are indeed conforming to this superior way. Then people will more readily listen to what we recommend.—&lt;Jal. 5:22-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Full Day in Field Service </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">witnessing work, why not stay out as long as possible? When the weather and other circumstances are favorable, take advantage of the situation to do more than usual. The more time we spend in talking the truth to others, the more opportunities we will have for finding honest-hearted ones. Thus, more praise goes to Jehovah and we will experience greater joy from our sacred service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Your Bible Handy?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “While I was eating lunch with another businessman, the subject turned to worsening world conditions. I always carry a Bible in my pocket and so I read 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and asked him if he thought it applied today. This led to a long interesting discussion and the reading of more scriptures. When we parted company I knew he was interested and told him I would be glad to arrange for someone in his part of the city to call at his home. ‘No,’ he said. ‘I want you to come. You read all the answers right from the Bible.’ ” This was not an unusual experience for this brother. It had happened a number of times before. He has been in the truth for many years, and has made it a point to be able to witness right from the Bible. He always has it handy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Is your Bible always handy? Note what Psalm 1:2 indicates in this regard: “But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” Any craftsman will tell you that the tools of bis trade are indispensable; he wouldn’t think of going to work without them. The Bible is our principal tool. It equips us for every good work. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) It should be nearby.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">t) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE IT HANDY AT HOME</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Some efficiency experts say that those who accomplish much use well the time that others waste. Much of our day is spent “between” things: between home and work, school, shopping or resting and other things. What could be more refreshing and beneficial during those waiting periods than reading the Bible? Our Theocratic School Bible reading during July averages about five and a half pages a week. That can be read by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Letter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">caring for some personal matters. Bethel elders may be requested by the congregations as weekend speakers within a radius of 200 miles, once a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You family members and friends back home miss those who left for Bethel service, and you can be sure they feel the same toward you. But we know how pleased you are to have them here doing such a vital work that benefits so many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We invite all of you single brothers between the ages of 19 and 35 who are wholeheartedly devoted to Jehovah, and in good health, and who are interested in enlarging your privileges of service, to come to Bethel for at least a year but with a view to staying much longer. the average reader in less than a half hour.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But there is more to it than straight Bible reading. Do you have the next Topic for Conversation well in mind? (See Presenting the Good News on page 4.) Having your Bible handy and going through it “in an undertone” or out loud will allow you to master it before you use it in the field. (Josh. 1:8) Repeating the “topic” a number of times will allow you to think of how to reply to additional arguments and objections that might come up in the field. Or, are you preparing for a return visit where a certain question must be answered, or are you hoping to start a home Bible study? Why not rehearse the points in your mind from time to time during the day if your task allows you to do this?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT KINGDOM HALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—IN FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Have your Bible ready for use at the Kingdom Hall. Many have commented favorably on the shorter </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study lessons, which allow us to use our Bibles more. By all means, bring your Bible to the meetings and use it. Some of the questions now also cite scriptures. Maybe you will want to read one and volunteer a comment on how it applies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Have your Bible handy in the field service. Some brothers have the Bible in hand when approaching a door. In some territories brothers prefer to have it in their pocket or easily accessible in their book bag. Whatever the situation, it is our chief instrument and should be ready for immediate use.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As previously mentioned, the psalmist encouraged reading God’s law day and night. One will surely experience increased blessings if he follows the psalmist’s advice, always keeping his Bible handy. Get a Bethel application at your district assembly, when your circuit overseer visits your congregation, or by writing the Society. Fill it out and make yourself available to become a part of the largest theocratic family, sharing in one of the grandest privileges of service on earth.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Jesus’ disciples asked about the future.—Luke 21:7.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. He predicted events taking place today.—Luke 21:10, 11, 28. (See Presenting the Good News, page 4.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">New Subscription Arrangements</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">i When a magazine Is mailed to a person twice a month by subscription, ne Is given many opportunities to Know Jehovah better. Anything we can do to give more persons this opportunity will be of Interest to us. We are pleased to announce the following new subscription arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ALTERNATIVE SUBSCRIPTION OFFER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">2 In addition to the usual offer, some publishers may wish to offer a sixmonth subscription and a 25c pocketsize book on a contribution of $1.00. Many persons may accept such a subscription and after six months may agree to a yearly subscription. Additionally. the subscriber would have a book which could be used to start a home Bible study. From his viewpoint he would immediately receive something substantial, namely, the book. Why not try this offer in the door-to-door activity during July?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTING SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">3 Beginning July 1. both new and renewal subscriptions obtained from unbaptized persons should be reported on your monthly field service report. We believe this adjustment will help all to appreciate that renewal subscriptions are just as Important as new ones. Of course, subscriptions for baptized persons would not be reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUBSCRIPTION RATE CHANGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">4 Effective July 1, the following simplified subscription pricing will be used the year around for both new and renewal subscriptions:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">s This means that the money remitted for a subscription will be the same regardless of whether it is new or renewal. or whether it is obtained during the subscription campaign or not. If individuals send renewals or new subscriptions personally to the branch office, the price would be the public rate because the office has no way of knowing every publisher. Pioneers will be able to submit their personal subscriptions at the pioneer rate. All, Including pioneers, are encouraged to send their subscriptions through the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EXPIRING SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">o When a subscription nears expiration, the Society places a renewal notice In one of the subscriber's magazines. At this same time we will also be preparing expiring subscription return visit slips (forms M-9L and M-191) tor all expiring subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 When these slips are received in the congregation, they should be compared with the duplicate subscription slips In the file. These duplicate slips can be attached to the return visit slips and given to the Bible study overseer. Then each return visit slip, with the subscription slip attached, can be handed to the publisher who turned in the subscription originally. If It Is for his personal subscription, then he can handle his renewal. If it Is for a person he has met in the field, he can make the return visit, as he already knows something about the Individual. This will be especially important for rural </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font9"> 2)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul asked fellow Christians to pray on his behalf “that ability to speak may be given me with the opening of my mouth, with all freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news.” (Eph. 6:19) He wanted to do well in talking to people and saw the importance of looking to Jehovah for help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Isn’t this exactly the way we feel today? In talking to people during July, what topic for conversation will you use? We can use our own or the following one.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Jesus' disciples asked about the future.—Luke 21:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. He predicted events taking place today.—Luke 21:10, 11, 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Our goal, of course, is not just to proclaim a message. We want to converse with the householder, getting him involved in the conversation. Then there is greater opportunity to learn his thoughts and generate interest. To start a conversation we might say: “Most people today are interested in the future. They feel that if they know in advance what will happen, they can plan their lives better. Do you feel that what the Bible predicts is of value today? [Allow response.] Jesus’ disciples wanted to know when this old system would end</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of July 1 will especially lend itself to this Topic for Conversation.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question teox</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• Who mav be used to read the paragraphs during the congregation book study and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">The purpose of reading the paragraphs at the meetings Is to benefit spiritually those in attendance. Therefore. efforts should be made to ensure good, fluent reading at the meetings. When a person reads too slowly, tne conductor may find It difficult to finish the study on time. Wrong emphasis, mispronunciation and stumbling over words In the reading can be very distracting, confusing and disturbing to the brothers and interested persons who are trying to concentrate on th; te-rial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One assigned to this privilege should also be a good example in the congregation. Must the reader be a baptized brother? This Is preferable but not a requirement. If none of the baptized brothers in the group are good readers, the book study conductor may decide just who In his group would be able to read in a way that would be of the greatest benefit to all in attendance. At times this may require using sisters at the book studies. It Is helpful to assign readers In advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As far as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study is concerned, the best readers should be used, even If there are only two or three. Here again. It would be preferable to use baptized brothers. In most congregations there will be no problem in this regard. But If there Is a problem, the elders should work out arrangements locally that they feel will best serve the spiritual Interests of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">a renewal is obtained, we can give the expiring subscription return visit slip and a copy of the subscription form we make out, along with the remittance, to the person handling subscriptions In the congregation. In this case, the publisher should advise the subscriber to disregard the renewal notice he received In the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">io If the subscriber has already renewed his subscription, we may still use the opportunity to further his Interest and perhaps offer a Bible study. In such a case the duplicate subscription slip should be filed In the congregation files for next year's reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ii These new arrangements will help more persons receive the magazines regularly through the mail and thus have uninterrupted delivery of precious Information In </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">All of us have enjoyed sharing in the Theocratic School. We have benefited greatly by our participation. In the future we hope to gain even more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For some time now no counsel has been given students having parts on the Theocratic School conducted at the circuit assemblies. This method has allowed time for the one conducting the school to highlight truths and principles that the students may not have included in their presentations. It has provided more information and knowledge to all in attendance. It also allows flexibility for giving better counsel to the student in that it is not given on the spur of the moment. More than two minutes may be used as advisable, and, being given privately, it could be more direct and specific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Because of all these advantages, this method will be used in the Theocratic Schools in each congregation as of March 1977. Hence, all school overseers will need to familiarize themselves fully with the material on which student talks are based so as to be able to mention the main points if they have not been presented, or perhaps by questions to highlight certain pertinent points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So that the Theocratic School may prove yet more helpful, literacy and/or reading improvement classes may be arranged in connection with it. Because of poor teaching systems in some communities, more and more youths are growing up with inadequate reading skills. Some adults may need further assistance in this respect, too. It will be up to each body of elders to survey carefully the needs of any associated with their congregation and then make such arrangements as they find are appropriate. As a suggestion though, the material scheduled for Bible reading may be used or a publication like the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher (Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">The Book Study—A Good Place for Spiritual Growth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus called attention to the vital need that his followers would have for spirituality, that is, to be the kind of persons who think like God, whose thoughts are elevated above those of man. He said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.”—Matt. 5:3; 6:19-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There are many ways that all of us can work toward the spirituality that Jesus outlined. One of such is through the congregation book study arrangement. Have you taken time lately to think about the many benefits we receive through this arrangement?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL MATERIAL CONSIDERED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> First of all, the material that we consider at our book studies helps us to think God’s thoughts, and by regularly elevating our minds and thoughts above those of man we are assisted in bringing every aspect of our lives into closer harmony with God’s requirements for his name people. For some weeks now we have been reading the paragraphs first at the book study, and it has been observed that this has enabled us</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Wise Use of Available Bible Study Aids</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> For over one hundred years Jehovah’s organization on earth has used the printed page to assist millions of people in coming to an accurate knowledge of the truth. Among the many printed publications used are both the large bound books and the pocket-size books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It was in 1968 when </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font13"> was released for general distribution. At that time there were over one million of Jehovah’s servants sharing the good news of the Kingdom with others. This large number of persons were assisted greatly in a spiritual way by the 384-page books available to them up to that time. Since then we have received additional large bound books at many of our yearly conventions and the information has been to our spiritual benefit and upbuilding.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">USING THEM IN THE FIELD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Many who have come to a knowledge of the truth in recent years have not had the opportunity to study these publications. Such ones will benefit from getting copies of available publications to read and study. When using these books to get more out of the lesson. Further, during March, as we study the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font13"> book, we will discuss Romans 12:2, analyzing together what is involved in not being fashioned after this system of things. It will be especially beneficial for us to do this at our book studies because there is greater opportunity to comment personally in these smaller groups.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Our spiritual growth also includes progressing in appreciation of our privilege of sharing Bible truths with others. Every one of us can encourage others in the group to share fully in spreading the Kingdom good news. How? By inviting others to work with us in the house-to-house field service, possibly by using one’s automobile for service, or perhaps by taking someone along on a particularly good return visit or Bible study. Do we give needed attention to older ones among us? What encouragement do you give to younger ones in your book study group? Our genuine concern for one another will be of much help toward good spiritual growth. —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">in our field service activity during March we should have in mind a highlight or two. For example, if you are using the topic for conversation centering around Psalm 37:8-11 and wish to highlight the value of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font13"> book, you could refer to pages 298 and 312, or the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font13"> book has a comment on this thought on page 122. In this way these older publications can be utilized in our field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Each congregation can stress placing such books that they have in stock. Congregations that would like to order what we have in stock in Brooklyn may do so. Or, they may ask neighboring congregations if they have extra supplies on hand. Mention of what is available in Brooklyn was made in the February issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom. Service.</span><span class="font13"> These publications will be placed at the regular contribution of 50c, and two booklets will be given free for study purposes. Where there is an opportunity to do so, try to use a booklet to introduce people to the Bible study arrangement. Surely this will result in praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Note: In this issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> we have arranged for only-three parts on each service meeting. Be sure to plan on having as many participants in each part as seems advisable. Keep meetings lively, informative, spiritually upbuilding and within the allotted time. This calls for preparation on the part of each one and especially those responsible for the various parts of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 81, announcements and a question-and-answer coverage of the article “The Book Study—A Good Place for Spiritual Growth.” Develop these points, with practical local application: (1) What will help us and our families to benefit fully in a spiritual way<sup>7</sup> from the study itself? (2) How field service is involved in our spiritual development, and (3) What we can do to help one another in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">“Presenting the Good News —With Effective Bible Conversations.” Discuss article with audience. Demonstrate approach suggested in paragraph three: include questions and answers on “Use Topics for Conversation in Field Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Wise Use of Available Bible Study Aids.” Question-and-answer coverage. Suggest demonstration (2-3 minutes) of information in paragraph three. Encourage new ones to get copies of available publications for personal library. Booklets will be used in March and April, so begin working with them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font11">starting studies. Song 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 6 Cultivating a More Spiritual Outlook</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 4. Announcements including accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Making the Book Study More Interesting. Brother handling part may use following outline of points in audience discussion. It may be possible for study conductors to make expressions on point one, others attending study on point two, and those with studies in their homes on point three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Consider the conductor’s role</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To teach others, conductor himself must have a good knowledge of the material, getting the Bible’s view (2 Tim. 2:2; Mal. 2:7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Teaching involves not just asking questions, but drawing out information</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He should analyze how material being studied can contribute to one’s relationship with Jehovah and how it can be used in a practical way</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conductor should listen carefully to comments to see if heart appreciation manifested. Should not expect more than is reasonable from those with limited education</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be kind, considerate of those in group (2) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Those attending the study</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Show interest by sharing in giving comments (Gal. 6:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now that paragraphs are read first, make it a practice to give answers to questions in your own words. However, if new, you may read answers to questions propounded and seek to grow in knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If a parent, consider needs of your children as well as others in attendance who appreciate an atmosphere conducive to learning. Thus when youngster may disturb meeting, take him outside of study area if possible and quiet him down so that study not disrupted</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Always be ready to look up and read Bible texts</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Consider privilege to have such a study in your home</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Householder should try to do his or her part to make each one welcome Strive to maintain clean, well-lighted area for study</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All should respect property of householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Reaching Hearing Ears. Talk, with audience participation. Revelation 22:17 says in part: “And let anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">We appreciate how satisfying it is to drink in waters of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have desire to help other thirsty ones (1 Cor. 9:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Many opportunities to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Need to realize people will live or die according to their reaction to good news (1 Pet. 4:5, 6, 17; 2 Thess. 1: 6-8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our concern not just to cover territory or report activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Help &lt;&nbsp;all sheeplike persons because we love them (1 Thess. 2:8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Heart appreciation should prompt us to speak at every opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Do not allow selves to become discouraged by lack of results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When persons do not respond, that is their responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Determination to prove our devotion and love for others should move us urgently to speak truth at every opportunity with assurance Jehovah will bless our efforts (Mal. 3:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Give encouragement to share in auxiliary pioneer work in April;</span><span class="font11"> make diligent efforts to reach hearing ears. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">(The following information may be used if desired. If elders feel some congregation matters are in need of attention, this material may be deleted.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Have Tender Affection for One Another.” February 1, 1977, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font11">Suggest having cross section of congregation represented on stage, to express what they appreciate about article and how practical application of such can be made. Prepare well so that main points are developed. Song 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 63, announcements and audience discussion of article “Improving Our Service Together.” Highlight scriptures and show how they apply. Wherever possible, have experiences showing benefits of giving and receiving assistance in field service. Include comments on Branch Letter, emphasizing beneficial adjustments in School. Review congregation field report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">How Our Young People Have Benefited from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> Book. Interview several young people, preferably teen-agers, who have sought and found answers in i connection with certain problems or situations in life. Great pressures on them to conform to worldly ways. Stress realistic approach to each problem and in each case show </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font11"> the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book material helped. Following situations are suggested, but if others fit your congregation, feel free to adjust. (1) How do you view discipline? (Pp. 92-96) (2) Movies and television? (Pp. 119-122) (3) Honorable conduct in courtship? (Pp. 152-156) (4) Is it realistic to be honest? (Pp. 172-179)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Use whatever situations fit and can be covered in allotted time. If not sufficient young people to match intended points, could discuss practical nature of material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Consideration of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">article of 11/15/76, “How Far Should Kindness Extend?” Cover as talk but with participation of audience on some key points. For example, appropriate to involve audience in discussion of paragraphs one through four of column one, page 676. Highlight fact Christians should not want their kindness and generosity to be less than that shown by persons who do not claim to serve God. Consider example of people on island of Malta where Paul was shipwrecked and what they did, in contrast with people claiming to be chosen of God in cities of Israel who showed Jesus greatest unkindness and indignity. Show need for Jehovah’s servants to exhibit kindness and consideration for all. Give consideration to how kindness can appropriately be shown in dealing with any who prove to be rebellious, unrepentant or stubborn. Highlight 2 Corinthians 10:1 as criterion for all our dealings. Song 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 9. Starting and Continuing Home Bible Studies. Audience discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On page three suggestions are given as to how we can improve our field service together. If you have heartfelt desire to start home Bible study, the following suggestions may prove helpful:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Start home Bible study on initial call. Some have had success by stating reason for calling is to find honest-hearted ones looking for God’s solution to problems that plague man today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then having a specific Bible thought in mind, such as Psalm 37:8-11, which deals with complete elimination of crime and violence, you could proceed to offer the Bible study. May tie in with booklet, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a God Who Cares?,</span><span class="font11"> pages 21-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">More often, studies are started through return visits. Sometimes several visits are required before the actual study is started. May need to develop friendly basis first, perhaps by making a number of brief visits, featuring a helpful Bible thought. (Discuss information page 122, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">or.)</span><span class="font11"> Or by regularly placing magazines with individuals. Some have Bible questions they will want answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At appropriate time, demonstrate how </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font11"> study will answer many questions. Likely will stimulate desire to have regular Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What should we study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No set rule; consider individual student’s needs, interests. Topics the student first mentions may help you to determine what to study. Consider with audience some of local interests of people. Try to use what will help the student most and hold his attention. Show sincere interest in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Right from start of study, good to include other members of family. Fewer problems when husbands and wives, whole families, study the truth together. Good to explain why there may be opposition to their study. —Matt. 10:36, 37 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(tr,</span><span class="font11"> p. 16)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup>Who is there among us that does not need and appreciate encouragement from time to time? In this connection have you ever felt the need for help in handling objections you meet in your house-to-house activity, or in learning how to rekindle interest on a return visit? Or would you like someone to take you along in field service with the objective of starting a home Bible study? Since approximately one half of all those sharing in Kingdom service have been in the truth only five years or so, doubtless a good number would be pleased to have help in some way to become more capable in field service. What can we do to improve our field service </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">together?—</span><span class="font13">1 Cor. 3:6; Gal. 6:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In terms of being able to help, think of your own book study group. If you see there is someone you might take with you from house to house, who would appreciate learning how to converse better with householders, could you take the initiative to assist that one? Together the two of you could discuss the points outlined in “Presenting the Good News,” which center around Psalm 37:8-11. This is also highlighted in the article “Use Topics for Conversation in Field Service.” (The topic suggested is, “Will there ever be an end to violence?”) Then endeavor to discuss this information from house to house.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps you need help in making return visits or in starting a home Bible study. Quite likely there is someone available to offer skilled help in these fields right in your own book study group. Do not hesitate to discuss your needs with the book study conductor, and perhaps he can make arrangements for helping you. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Often when midweek service arrangements are well organized and coordinated, pioneers and other qualified brothers and sisters are available to help, and these delight to do so. Or, if the best time for you to receive assistance is in the evening, perhaps some calls can be made for a short period of time before the book study. More and more people are working secularly, and a good time to visit them may be during the early evening hours, if conditions allow in your area. Saturday and Sunday are days most of us have time to share in field service and when many working people are at home. It is also the time most elders and ministerial servants can work with others in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Book study conductors, aware of the spiritual needs of their groups, can do much to arrange for them to have assistance in improving their service, which can add so much to enjoyment and effectiveness.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Conversation, like music, is an art. To become skilled at it requires practice. If we are conscious of the need to cultivate the art, we will find much opportunity as we go from house to house. How grateful we are to Jehovah that we have the opportunity to carry on Bible conversations with those we meet at the doors. But what is involved in making our conversations “effective” and how do we get good results when “conversing” with householders? There are several ways: Be friendly, be discerning, be tactful, be a good listener.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Initially, it is good to put ourselves in the householder’s position. For example, many people are occupied with household duties and other matters when we ring the bell. So we may be viewed as intruding on their time, &quot;uninvited guests” as it were. What will help to resolve this problem and gain a listening ear?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps we could say, after introducing ourselves appropriately: “Quite likely you have things to do, so I’ll get to the point of my</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Will there ever be an end to violence? —Psalm 37:8-11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Soon the wicked will be removed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. True peace will prevail.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Almost everyone responds to kindness, warmth, and a genuine concern for his welfare. As we approach householders in this manner, we will also want to have something to say that will immediately appeal to them. This is where “Topics for Conversation in Field Service” should prove quite helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Most of us are not pioneers and so we are not out in the field service as often as we would like to be. But when we go, surely we would like to be winsome and discerning in our conversations. Since Topics for Conversation in Field </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Service will now be featured in</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">call. Have you ever hoped for an end to the increasing violence we see all around us?” (Mention a local example of this, if available.) Allow time for a response by householder. Then you could say: “On this subject the promises made by God at Psalm 37 are of interest, and I’d like to share them with you.” Remember, conversation is a two-way street. It means listening as well as talking, so we should allow time for a response from the householders as we discuss matters with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> At an appropriate time you can ask the householder how he feels about the fulfillment of such a promise by the only One really capable of carrying out his promises. Then, depending upon the reaction and the interest displayed, you could show’ him something in a publication that might interest him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Since the offer during March is any one of the 50c books, it would be good to select in advance some fitting points relative to the end of wickedness by means of the Kingdom. Preparation will aid you to converse and to make practical use of the literature too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font13"> perhaps some questions and answers relative to this feature will be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Q. Do these topics have to be changed by you each time a new subject is introduced in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service<sup>1</sup>?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font13"> No. Perhaps changing three or four times a year may work out well for you personally. This will allow you the time and practice in the field so you can get thoroughly acquainted with them and the Scriptural thoughts presented therewith. This should be helpful in building confidence and ability to present the good news with ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Q. How should these topics be introduced?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A. Local current events such as what is happening in the community or on the world or national scene often prove helpful. An example of this is given in “Presenting the Good News” in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Q. Are we required to stick to these topics at every door?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">these topics helpful, if you have been able to develop something more effective, more applicable locally, feel free to use it. These are only suggestions and can be used or varied at the discretion of the publisher. Pioneers who are out in the field often will no doubt find it helpful to use variations of this topic or other topics of conversation. And if your territory is covered frequently, you will necessarily vary your themes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Q. What is our goal in being able to share these topics of conversation? Is it merely placing literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A. Not in itself. We want to give a testimony or message to the people. First, we can acquaint householders with God’s Word, the Bible, which points to the real remedy for man’s problems, namely the Kingdom. Secondly, we desire that people use the literature to help them to understand what is in the Bible, since it is usually difficult for them to appreciate its teachings. The topic for conversation is designed to help us to talk to those who will give us a listening ear, so we might stimulate interest in God’s Word.</span></p>

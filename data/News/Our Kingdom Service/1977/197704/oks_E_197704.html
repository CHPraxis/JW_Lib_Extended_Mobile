<p><span class="font12">In this “time of the end” it is to be expected that opposition to the Kingdom message and its pro-claimers will increase. This is in line with Jesus’ prophecy that “people will lay their hands upon you and persecute you,” and that “you will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name.” All of this, Jesus said, “will turn out to you for a witness.”—Luke 21:12-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In view of Jesus’ words, it is not surprising that the Christian work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is now restricted in more than forty countries. The list continues to grow. In April 1976 it was Benin. Then, in August, Argentina and the Central African Republic followed this course. On December 23 the Southeast Asian country of Indonesia placed a ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Protestant section of the Office of Religion, supported by the clergy in local areas, have long agitated for this. In January 1977 the Congo announced a ban.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our brothers in all these countries, like those elsewhere, are very courageous in the face of these actions and continue to do everything possible to witness about the Kingdom. It is good to pray for them. Seeing the enemy forces closing in throughout the earth, all of us can take courage from Jesus’ promise: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—Luke 21:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As recorded in Matthew chapter ten, Jesus also gave encouraging counsel to those facing opposition. Whether it comes from family or friends, people in the territory or from official sources, we want to show loyalty to Jehovah and his kingdom and continue faithfully in our privilege of representing Him.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was seated by a well in Samaria waiting for his disciples to return with the food they had gone to buy. He was tired and thirsty but was still ready to give a timely witness that fitted the circumstances. Read for yourself how the conversation went as recorded at John 4:7-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Do you also take favorable opportunities to give a witness, relating the conversation to things at hand in just such a natural but interesting way? You will find many occasions to do so each day if you are alert to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What are some situations that Jesus and his disciples used to give a witness, not just when going to the homes of the people, but wherever they found the opportunity? One time “while passing along” Jesus spoke to Matthew who was “seated at the tax office.” Another time he had been walking through some grainfields when he took the opportunity to speak to the Pharisees. Later he spoke to a crowd who gathered at the sea. On many occasions and in various locations Jesus gave an impromptu witness. He spoke both to strangers and to persons he knew.—Matt. 9:9; 12:1-4; 13:1-4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Paul made it a part of his service to talk to those “who happened to be on hand” in the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Faith in Jehovah God and in his Kingdom rule through Christ Jesus is greatly to be desired. It makes possible a favorable relationship with Jehovah and gives one the wonderful prospect of everlasting life. But solid faith rarely comes easily. Many persons desire faith but find obstacles in their way to putting full confidence and faith in what they have learned about the truth. Can we do something to help them?—2 Thess. 3:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Each year at the Memorial of Jesus’ death, we see many interested persons come to the Kingdom Hall. No doubt the extent of their faith varies but at least they were willing to make an effort to come on this important occasion. Can they be helped to make further spiritual progress? Perhaps you are just the one who could be of assistance. Even Jesus’ disciples at one time said to him: “Give us more faith.” (Luke 17:5) We can be helpful to such persons today in aiding them to build a solid marketplace in Athens. (Acts 17: 17) He took advantage of every situation to speak about Jehovah, even late at night after being released from prison, as well as later to all who visited him when under house arrest.—Acts 16:2534; 28:30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Do we also take advantage of opportunities to give a witness or do we wait until we are “out in service” or only talk about the truth when we are calling from house to house “in our territory”? How rewarding also to look for openings to give a witness knowing that the field is the world and that we may never have a better opportunity to talk to certain ones! Certainly we have Bible precedent for such informal witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>0</sup> While such service may not be “formal witnessing” in that we have not made specific plans to talk to certain persons, yet it may well be witnessing for which we have prepared to some extent by thinking of possible appropriate topics for conversation to use, or by taking literature along in the hope of finding someone who might appreciate it. If you have ever been without some literature in your car or on your person when you met someone showing interest, you can appreciate the wisdom of plan-</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">faith. This faith comes by hearing a discussion of the word of God by a person of faith. As Romans 10:17 says, “Faith follows the thing heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Do you know someone that might be helped to grow in faith in Jehovah’s purposes, in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, in the wonderful prospects of the new system of righteousness? Then let them hear the word of truth from you. Encourage them to read material that will help them to build their faith; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> especially could be presented to them during this month. But try to help them to find material that will be of interest and that will build their faith. For example, what may be holding back the person from spiritual progress? Is it lack of confidence in the Bible? Is he inclined to believe in evolution? Or is it some doctrinal teaching of Babylonish religion that hinders him from understanding Jehovah’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Song 78. Local announcements, also discuss “Report Field Service Twice a Month.” Questions and answers on &quot;Building Faith in Others.” If time permits, discuss Romans 10:11-14 in conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: Faith is built on a knowledge of the Bible. (Rom. 10:17) Encourage use of Bible in the service. Our topic for conversation will help us do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstration: (5 min.) Publisher uses as his topic the question, Will there ever be an end to violence? Refer to Psalm 37:8-11. Many feel they should take action themselves to stop evildoers. God promises to end violence himself. Explain how the April 1 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> gives tine Information on the subject &quot;The Sure Promise of a Secure New Order.&quot; Encourage householder to take subscription to build faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will help us build interest and faith in the Bible. Discuss with audience talking points from the current magazine, emphasizing how we could show a householder that it would be of value to him. Discuss how current issue ties in with topic for conversation. Recommend that conductors review at the next meeting for field service the topic for conversation just presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">22 min: Planting the seed of truth is only the first step. Our desire is to conduct Bible studies so the Interest can be cultivated. We offer three booklets with the subscription to aid us in starting studies. Leaving magazines or even a subscription is not usually enough to help one learn the truth.. It takes patience and effort. Try offering a demonstration of the study on the first call where appropriate. Select the booklet you want to use and get acquainted with it. Practice starting a study at home or with another publisher and then try it in the service. To do this successfully we need to be familiar with the material to be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.): Chairman studies with congregation material as time permits starting from beginning of booklet Is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">There a God Who Cares?</span><span class="font10"> Read paragraphs first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Offer to demonstrate Bible study can also be made in the magazine work. It is Important for us to see that the only way to help seeds planted to grow Is to give continued care through return visits and Bible studies. Mention article “Following Up on Expired Gift Subscriptions. Conclude with Romans 10: 20 showing importance of our service. Song 17 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing the Truth on Every Occasion</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Song 117. Announcements, Including report of field activity of congregation for the past month. Audience discussion of questions and answers on article &quot;Scatter Seeds of Truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Reaching People by Informal Witnessing. Chairman: We have good reason to bless Jehovah every day. (Ps. 145:2, 10) Ask audience for situations (not experiences) where a witness might be given other than in actual field activity. Many more people could be reached if each of us would take advantage of opportunities every day. Encourage the brothers to consider in which of the following situations they can see themselves giving an informal witness in view of personal circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scene I. Brother on secular job gives witness to workmate who asked about article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> he is reading during lunch period. Chairman comments on fact that many brothers make a habit of taking Society’s publications to work to read. Provides opening for informal witness. Does this give you an idea to do the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scene II. Three sisters talk about advantages of giving informal witness. One mentions that on an evening when she cannot get out she likes to write to friends and relatives and in a casual way always makes mention of the truth. Then if she gets favorable response she may send some literature or a gift subscription. Second sister says she likes to witness to people she meets when out shopping. Third sister says she sometimes witnesses to people who come by the home. First sister asks them to show how they do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scene III. While waiting in line at check-out counter in market, second sister talks to woman who complains about high food costs. Agrees it is a problem out says that a secure future is possible. Presents booklet on that subject. Chairman: By having magazines or other literature in purse or car one can always be prepared to follow up on informal witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scene IV. Salesman calls at home of third sister, who raises question about how things are going for him. Steers conversation to Bible. Encourages person to read booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a God Who Cares?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scene V. Teen-age Witness In school talks to friend, stating that teacher cannot convince him of evolution because it is too unreasonable from what he reads. Friend asks him what he means and he shows him picture on pages 74 and 75 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book. Schoolmate says that his parents sometimes get our literature but that he docs not know what it is about. Publisher suggests that he can visit friend at home to explain more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman points out that informal witnessing is something we can all do. Many are already doing it. It is good to plan for such opportunities. By doing so we can reach many more people. Encourage congregation to see wnat they can do in the next few days in trying to give an informal witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Has informal witnessing brought results? Ask congregation for experiences. How many got interested in the truth because of informal witnessing? Have some had good results locally In doing this? (Chairman may be prepared with experiences from the publications such as those found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">w71</span><span class="font10"> 4/1 pages 221, 222; w73 3/15 pages 187. 188.) Do brothers understand that It is appropriate to report time used that way, even if only a few minutes at a time? Stress that it is good for us to be friendly with others, as it often opens the way to a fine witness. Song 51 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 43. Local announcements. Helping new persons progress spiritually. In visiting the people this month we have two ways to help them. We are Interested In starting Bible studies and getting subscriptions. Mention how many subscriptions have been obtained thus far. Also ask how many have been able to demonstrate or start a Bible study during the month. Jesus encouraged Bible study. (Luke 24:45; John 21: 15) Are our Bible students progressing well? Do they &quot;grasp the meaning of the Scriptures”? Discuss with questions and answers “Presenting the Good News—By Conducting a Helpful Bible Study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Starting and conducting interesting studies. Chairman briefly mentions need to catch interest of householder so that it is his desire to hear more. How can this be done? Notice how publisher simply uses cover of booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">18 There a God Who Cares?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstration: (5 min.) In concluding discussion of Psalm 37:8-11, ask householder if he thinks there will ever be an end to crime and violence. Mention that, since there is so much of it in the world, many people wonder if God really cares. Point to the questions on the cover of the booklet. Ask householder: Do these things concern you? Do you know how to get the answers? Publisher explains that this booklet is designed to help us learn the answers from the Bible. Ask to spend a few minutes to show householder how this can be done. Briefly start discussion with paragraph seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman next discusses with congregation making study instructive. Read and discuss with congregation paragraph 18. Ask: Why is reading paragraph first especially helpful in starting a study? Why is it best to encourage student to put answer in his own words? Why is it good to explain how to find scriptures Instead of just telling person the page number? Why are viewpoint questions helpful? For example, regarding the illustration, does he see a point he could apply in his life? Encourage those conducting studies to talk kindly to students about the need to progress to have Jehovah’s blessing. —Luke 8:9-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font10">Discussion on question, Wha is required for spiritual progress? with brief demonstration. Discuss with congregation Jehovah’s instructions at Hebrews 10:24 and what might be said to encourage persons we study with to come to meetings. Interview some who bring people to meetings as to how they go about it. Ask why they feel that meeting attendance is so important and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once people do come to meetings, how can we help them progress besides making them feel welcome? Present two short demonstrations, both scenes after a home Bible study. In first one publisher helps the student prepare a comment for the book study, using the material next scheduled for study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font10"> book. In the second scene. Interested one has been assigned a talk for the Theocratic SchooL so publisher encourages person to read over the material and make note of the key scriptures and then offers to help the person in arranging the talk. We want to help each person associated with the congregation progress spiritually and become equipped to share the good news.—2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: [If local body of elders have material they feel important to present, it can be used instead of following, with brief references to points made herein.] Discuss with congregation the question. Who Can Share in the Preaching of the Good News? Consider with questions and answers the material from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 128130.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstration: Brother at Bible study explains topic for conversation to student and invites him in service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintaining a Happy Family Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Song 10. Chairman makes brief announcements and then mentions meeting will deal with above theme. Introduces scene, with elder being asked by brother how he can cope with his family situation. He realizes that real spiritual &quot;life&quot; seems to be missing from his family. Elder reasons with brother on Importance of his own spiritual attitude—it his headship is to be respected, he is obliged to follow directions of his head. Christ (1 John 2:6), assign his wife honor as weaker vessel (1 Pet. 3:7), train his children (Eph. 6:4), and so forth. (See Aid under Headship, p. 726; w76 10/15 pages 613616.) Family oneness developed through study, service and recreation along with good communication. Elder lovingly helps brother to arrive at his own decision as to what he can and must do to correct family situation. Elder then turns to &quot;multitude of counselors” In audience for observations on what family members can do to cooperate In developing and maintaining a happy family life. Also brings up Question Box material and shows need for each one watching conduct at local meetings as well as at assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 mtn: Obedience to Parents Brings Happiness and Life. (Eph. 6:1-3) Youngsters In congregation can be interviewed saying what they have learned from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> book on obedience, and with older ones, preferably of teen - age. mentioning the benefits obedience has brought them in avoiding temptations In school. Scriptures from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure,&quot;</span><span class="font10"> pages 359-362 may be used If time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Working in the Field as a Family. Talk first on how children trained by one or both parents have faithfully served Jehovah, such as Samuel (1 Sam. 1:21-28; 2:11) and Timothy (2 Tim. 1:5: 3:15), and so forth. Are you also training your children? (Ps. 148:12, 13) Training for field service Involves good example of parent, and Instilling desire to tell others the truth. Make learning enjoyable. Where there are two or more children Involved, let them practice presentations on one another. Demonstrate how father or mother helps children prepare for service by developing brief presentation. For example: Child, after Introduction of him by older publisher working with him. might say: “I would like to grow up in a world where there Is no crime. Did you know that the Bible promises an end to crime in the near future? Let me show you where you can read this In the Bible.”—Turns to Psalm 37:9, 10. &quot;There is more good news like this In the Bible. You can learn about It by reading this Bible study aid.&quot; (Opens </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font10"> book to page 8) &quot;You can have this for just 25c.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also briefly demonstrate parent explaining to child how to give a witness to a fellow student at school, and then have, child tell how it went as he reports back to his parent on the result of the witness given. If time allows, show parent ano child on return visit of placement child has made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Benefits of such loving example and training are closer relationships In family as well as better prepared youngsters In field service. Song 60 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Building Faith in Others </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">purposes? If you know what it is, you will be in a better position to call to his attention some of the fine material that has been published on such subjects as well as discussing what the Bible says on these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">« Since faith is a fruit of the spirit, it will grow in the right soil when God’s inspired Word is allowed to influence the individual. If you do what you can to get regular discussions or a Bible study started using one of the booklets that are so well designed to overcome common objections, then Jehovah will help you in getting the seed of truth to grow. But which booklet should be used? This depends on the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> For example, the booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">There Is Much More to Life!</span><span class="font12"> discusses the question of evolution, how life began, the reasons for the world’s problems and the way to survive for eternal life. The booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A Secure Future—How You Can Find It</span><span class="font12"> appeals to the common desire for security, but it gives some fine Bible background, snowing that only God can provide what man really needs, who Jehovah is, his qualities, what the Bible tells us about the reason for insecurity today and how a secure future is possible. The booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a God Who Cares?</span><span class="font12"> answers questions that hinder the faith of man such as: Is God to blame for the present problems we face? How did wickedness begin? Why has it been permitted for so long? And what is God’s purpose regarding a righteous new order?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> Select the material you think would be most helpful to the persons you would like to help. You might make a list of persons you would like to visit during the month. Take along a copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> that you think might be of interest and encourage them to subscribe in order to build up their own faith. But whether they subscribe or not, try to get a Bible study started. Take a personal interest yourself in these persons, talking the truth to them and encouraging them to discuss the Bible with you. Our objective is to build faith that leads to life as we share with people who are searching for the truth the knowledge we have already received.—Rom. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Will there ever be an end to violence?—Psalm 37:8-11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Soon the wicked will be removed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. True peace will prevail.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Report Field Service Twice a Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregation publishers sometimes overlook turning in a field service report at the end of the month. It will be practical for them to turn in a report by about the 15th of the month and then another at the end of the month. The regular report slip will be used. Congregation elders should plan to remind all congregation publishers of the need to turn in field service reports at the meeting nearest to the 15th and to the end of the month. Some, by overlooking the turning in of their reports, are now counted as irregular publishers, when in fact they have published the good news each month. If some congregations wish to ask the congregation book study conductors to collect the reports twice a month and turn them over to the field overseer, there is no objection to that arrangement. Do what will be of greatest help to the publishers and the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Scatter Seeds of Truth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ning for such possibilities as you go about your daily activities or on trips.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> It is not necessary to try to have a lengthy discussion with each person. You may wish to be brief, just a sentence at a time to see how the person replies or if interest is shown. That is what Jesus did. (John 4:7-26) If no interest is shown, you may prefer not to continue the conversation. Whether you are at school or at work, at home or shopping, with friends or family or with strangers, you will find many possibilities of talking in an interesting way about what you have learned. Do not overlook including time spent in this way when you turn in your field report.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Our giving an informal witness greatly enlarges the number of persons we are privileged to witness to and may mean we can speak to many who are not regularly reached with the Kingdom message. Just as a farmer scatters his seed on the soil, so we desire to spread seeds of truth.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">By Conducting a Helpful Bible Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On the average during the last service year there were 1,339,466 Bible studies conducted regularly world wide, some with several persons attending. It is a work that brings much joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> You too can have a share in this work if you have the desire and are willing and able to put forth the time and effort. Disciple making is a work Jesus said should be done and conducting Bible studies is a way to do this. Do you conduct such a study with your own family? Could you also study with someone else?—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> It is clear, as the interesting experience in the August 1976 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font12"> showed, that some publishers are more successful in making disciples than others. The article told of two couples who have had outstanding success in this field, each couple aiding between 250 and 300 persons to become dedicated praisers of Jehovah. Is there something we can do to be more successful in this work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> These couples tried to involve the whole family. They worked together, and the sessions were never simply question-and-answer reviews, but were enthusiastic discussions of the truth, helping the students to see the value of what they were learning. They stressed the importance of keeping the study appointment. They tried to bring people to the meetings and to acquaint them with the organization. They saw the need to be genuine friends of the people. Have you tried these suggestions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Being whole-souled in your efforts to help Bible students to progress will bring Jehovah’s blessing. Remember, they are Jehovah’s</span></p></li></ul>

However, it may be our privilege to help lay the foundation of truth in the hearts of some. For a start especially, it is good to discuss matters of special interest to the person. Let him pick the subject he wants to discuss. Once he learns the value of what he is studying he will want to continue and enlarge his understanding of other topics from God’s Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> It is of great help to keep the discussion flexible. Find out what the person thinks about the topic before you start. Many find it good to paraphrase certain questions, as it encourages the person to put his reply in nis own words also, rather than in the words of the publications. Occasional questions to see if the person agrees with what is being said may be helpful to you in determining if more Scriptural discussion of certain thoughts would be in order.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Help the householder to understand how the material is of concern to him and will benefit him and his family. Do not hesitate in a tactful w.iy to point out the difference between the teachings of the Bible and religious traditions. Do you feel you are reaching the heart of the student? Is he responding to your efforts, accepting your invitation to come to the congregation meetings at the Kingdom Hall or the book study? Is he talking with his friends about what he is learning? If not, you may wish to try enlarging his view of the organization, telling him about the assemblies, the worldwide educational work and how instructive our meetings are for each one in the family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> When you feel it is appropriate to start opening and closing the discussion with prayer, it will help the student to see even more the importance of the study. In your personal prayers, ask Jehovah for his direction and spirit so that the studies you conduct will be productive and your efforts to make disciples will have his blessing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The first assembly hall in Japan was completed at the end of November and was in use the first weekend of December. On the average about 200 persons shared each day in remodeling this former bowling alley. The willingness and hard work of all the brothers and sisters who helped during the three-month construction period gave a very fine witness. The hall, which has seating for 1,500 and is located on the outskirts of Tokyo, is ideal in sixe and location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Following Up on Expired Gift Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When we are given an expired subscription slip it should be our desire to call on the former subscriber with the aim of furthering his interest in the good news as well as encouraging him to resubscribe. The person may have been the recipient of a gift subscription rather than having subscribed directly. To aid us in adapting our approach in making the return visit on such persons, the letters “GFT” will now appear along with the address on expiration slips on former gift subscriptions in connection with English subscriptions in the continental United States.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>'Question (jSox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">• Why should parents be concerned with controlling their children’s conduct at the Kingdom Hall and at assemblies. and what should the elders do It parents habitually fall to exercise such control?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The conduct of children directly reflects on the training given by their parents and on how deeply the children's hearts have been Impressed with respect for the laws of Jehovah and man. (Prov. 29:15) &quot;For everything there is an appointed time.&quot; including running and playing: but that time Is not when one is at Christian meetings, whether at the Kingdom Hall or at assemblies.—Eccl. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some youngsters are naturally more energetic and mischievous than others. Understanding the hearts of their children, parents may find that they will have to keep a closer watch on some than on others. If some are not closely watched by their parents and are found to be running around bumping Into people, even defacing the Kingdom Hall property, and so forth, then elders or others would do well to speak to the child or to bring the child to one of his parents so that corrective measures may be taken. Parents should welcome this loving assistance so that shame Is not brought on them because of the conduct of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In those rare cases where parents habitually fall to exercise control despite the kind counsel of individual elders, then several elders may get together with the family at an appropriate time and place and talk with them about the Scriptural principles involved and the necessity ot maintaining proper conduct at home and at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Q)eaft ^Kingdom ^PuWlstefts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the past few months, in addition to our normal activity, we have been very busy here arranging for all the elders in this country to go through the new Kingdom Ministry School Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the week of October 4-8, there were 372 circuit and district overseers who attended the first classes of the new Kingdom Ministry School Course and enjoyed it immensely. The course is geared to help elders render better service in shepherding their brothers, in teaching, in providing a helpful lead in the field service, in counseling and judging and in working together well as a body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One commented: “The course was far beyond anything I had hoped for.” Another: “How often we were reminded to ‘preach the Word’ in offering counsel and when answering questions.” And another said: “We have been filled with ideas as to what we can do in a positive way to aid our brothers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These same brothers also got a brief review of the new Pioneer Service School Course. They were thrilled with the course. Some of their comments were: “It is practical!” “It is a real Bible study.” “It is obvious Jehovah is deeply concerned about the pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then, during the week of October 11-15, 662 more brothers, who will have a part in teaching the Kingdom Ministry School Course in their own circuits, went to school to help them get ready to teach. Over 900 brothers will have a share in teaching the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, during November and the early part of December all the elders in this country have been scheduled to attend the new school course in their own circuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is apparent that ‘Jehovah the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls’ is continuing to care for his people in a marvelous way.—1 Pet. 2:25.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">*“1 bend my knees to the Father, to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name,” wrote the apostle Paul. (Eph. 3:14, 15) Yes, Jehovah is the Father of mankind and also the Originator of the family arrangement. He knows and can tell us what is needed to make a family spiritually strong and happy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah has set the perfect example for all fathers by effectively instructing us through his Word and by means of the faithful and discreet slave. (John 6: 45) Are you fathers regularly feeding your wives and children with spiritual food? Are you studying with them, using publications and information appropriate to their needs? Take the initiative in providing the help that is needed. Encourage heart-to-heart discussions with the members of your family. Help them to grow spiritually. You will reap good fruitage from your hard work if you do.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARE IN KINGDOM-PREACHING AS A FAMILY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> During December, with its school holidays, parents have an excellent opportunity to share in Kingdom-preaching with their children. Endeavor together to engage householders in conversation and to present the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World Government </span><span class="font0">book on a contribution of $1.25. Since this will be the first time we will be offering the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World Government</span><span class="font0"> book in the field, it may be helpful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font0"> your whole family has some ‘practice sessions.’ This can be done with others at the book study group, too. Preparing ahead of time will help you as you endeavor to engage householders in the conversation and to present the offer in an interesting way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How Many Can You Reach?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> How many people do you pass ] in a day’s time? How many of these have you ever greeted or talked to? Have you ever wondered how many of these have ever heard the good news from one of our brothers? And how many have not? One brother, in an area where the territory is covered every few months, and much of it every few weeks, decided to talk to those who were on the street one day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> As he walked, he watched the eyes of those approaching him. When he had ‘eye contact’ with a person, he smiled and said: ‘Excuse me. May I ask, Would you care for the latest </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span><span class="font0"> Have you ever read them?’ The first three people he approached said </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">they had never seen them before.</span><span class="font0"> While the brother was surprised to hear this— in an effort to keep the conversation going, he said: ‘I can un-</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Whether both husband and wife are in the truth, or only one of you, when you share with your children in the field, it can be a very pleasant time for you and for them. Commend them for the efforts they put forth and the progress they make. As you serve together, you also have the fine opportunity to help your children make progress in Jehovah’s service. Do they need assistance in encouraging the householder to have a share in the conversation? If you observe this, you can help them. Do they lack appreciation for the real purpose of the field service? Help them to see that lives are involved and that our service is an honor to Jehovah. Are they discouraged when householders are brusque? Help them to see that the householder was not angry with us personally. Do your children need help to see why we should participate regularly in Kingdom-preaching? (Rev. 22:2) As you accompany them, you will become aware of their needs and will be in a position to encourage and help them.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">derstand that. We call at the homes of people here in the neighborhood quite regularly, but so many are not at home, and it may be that you were not at home when we called either. But let me tell you briefly something about them and the good news they contain for you.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> The brother and his wife approached people in a variety of ways that day. They placed lit-terature with some and talked with many. It was a very pleasant experience for them. And it was their conversations with the people they met that made it pleasant.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> How many people are there in your territory who have never had opportunity to hear the good news? Look at the people you pass when you are away from home. Some of them are standing and waiting. Some of them are</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 95. Announcements. Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Are You Prepared to Talk on the Bible?” Talk ana audience participation on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article, in issue of November 1, 1977.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">“Are You Instructing Your Family?” Cover the material , with questions and answers. To be handled by a brother who sets a fine example in assisting his family. Include brief demonstration or two, using topic for conversation or as outlined in paragraph six. Encourage parents to share in the field service with their teenage children as well as younger ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Why Do They Auxiliary-Pioneer? Interview brothers and sisters who have served as auxiliary pioneers. Ask: What motivated you? How were you able to be of help to others or how were you helped by others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some, asked why they auxiliary-pioneered, answered: ‘Out of love for Jehovah.’ ‘The fact that others were doing it was encouraging; I found it enjoyable to work with others doing the same thing.’ ‘I was encouraged when the elders enrolled as auxiliary pioneers. They were not just talking about it from the platform but were setting an example. If they could do it with their busy schedule, so could I.’ ‘I knew that the more who did it the easier it would be, so I did it, hoping it would encourage someone else.’ ‘I enjoy field service and this meant more service and more joy for me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One elder said: ‘I could not regularpioneer but I enjoy field service and so arranged to auxiliary-pioneer. I found it best to do this when school children in the congregation were on vacation. When they learned that an elder was going in the service each day, a number of them arranged to auxiliarypioneer too. It was stimulating, resulting in starting new studies, and others expressed appreciation for my working with them in this special activity.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Encourage all who can do so to auxiliary-pioneer during the holiday period. Encourage parents to share in the work with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Encourage all to read the book of Jonah before the service meeting next week. Song 13. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 56. Accounts Report. Local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">28 min: </span><span class="font12">“Can You Benefit from Jonah’s Experience?” There is much we can learn from what happened in Jonah’s day. Audience participation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 1:1-3. What assignment of service was Jonah given? (verse 2) (Much like our’s today) Who sent him? (verse 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ask audience to turn to the map on the front endsheet of the bil2 Bible and locate the city of Joppa. Where was Nineveh? Where was Tar-shish? How many times farther would it be to Tarshish than to Nineveh? Do you think it was foolish for Jonah to leave Jehovah’s people and to try to go so far away, without Jehovah’s blessing, to get away from his assignment ? Why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why would it show a wrong motive to scnedule other activities for ourselves in a deliberate effort to avoid having a full share in the work of preaching and disciple-making that Jehovah has given us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What happened to Jonah because he </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tried </span><span class="font12">to get away from the assignment</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">that Jehovah gave him? (Jonah 1:4, 10, 12, 17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 2:1, 2, 9, 10. What did Jonah do to get help? (verse 1) Did Jehovah hear his prayer? (verse 2) What did Jonah promise Jehovah? (verse 9) According to verse 10, what happened to Jonah? What can we learn from those verses?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 3:1-4. How big a territory was Nineveh? (verse 3) What was the message that Jonah proclaimed?, (verse 4) Do you think it was easy for Jonah to preach that message?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 3:5, 8, 10. Why did Jehovah show mercy to the people of Nineveh? Do you believe that Jehovah will show mercy to people now if they put faith in him ana change from their bad ways? How does this emphasize the urgency of the disciple-making work today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 4:1, 3, 4. What was Jonah’s attitude when Jehovah did not destroy Nineveh at the time that Jonah expected it? Was that the right attitude?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">Read Jonah 4:11. How does verse 11 indicate that Jehovah desires people to repent and live? How did Jonah describe Jehovah in verse 2? What should be our attitude over the fact that Jehovah is having the preaching work continue and people are still learning the truth? Invite expressions from one or two publishers who have learned the truth in the past two years and who appreciate Jehovah’s patience in having the preaching continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “What Would You Say?” To be handled by an elder who does well in the field service. Ascertain beforehand from hard-working publishers and pioneers some of the objections that are most common in your territory. Have audience comment on how they would answer the objections. Consider also common holiday greetings and how to handle these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Spend most of the time entertaining suggestions from the audience. Use one or two capable publishers or pioneers to demonstrate briefly how they handle these objections in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Encourage families to share in field service together on the weekend. Song 33. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 34. Announcements. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font12">A Closer Look at the Jubilee and Its Provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) Chairman: What was the liberty that Jehovah’s people inhabiting the land of Israel were to enjoy on the 50th year, the Jubilee? It was deliverance from indebtedness and from servitude. It was a time for handing back property lost because of economic problems. Also, if an Israelite had fallen into debt and, if in order to pay his debt, he had sold himself or members of his family into servitude, then on the Jubilee (even if the customary six years of servitude had not been completed) he and the members of his family were to be set free, his debt was to be canceled and he was to be given enough provisions to start a free life again. (Lev. 25:13-33, 39-13, 53, 54) The Jubilee was a restoration of the condition that Jehovah established for his people when they entered the promised land. Of what value is this information to us today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(23 min.) Discuss with audience:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What is the symbolic Jubilee? (w 8/1/76, page 454)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. What evidences do we see to indicate that our deliverance is near? (Luke 21:26, 28)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. How do the Jubilee and God’s incoming new system of things show that Jehovah is a compassionate God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. How do they prove that Jehovah recognizes man’s need for land and income? (Isa. 65:21)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. Just as Jehovah promised Israel, what can his people confidently look forward to in the coming new order? (Isa. 25:6-8)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">6. Since debts were canceled during the Jubilee, does this mean that we can go into debt and wait for the “great tribulation” to cancel our debts? (Rom. 13:8; 2 Kings 4:7)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">7. What do the Scriptures encourage us to do for our brothers when they have a need and when we are able to help? (Jas. 2:15-17; Lev. 25:35)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">8. What view should be taken of those who persist in not putting forth the effort to help themselves? (2 Thess. 3:10)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">9. What does all of this help us to appreciate about our loving heavenly Father? Our responsibilities? And our hope for the future?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">The entire arrangement of the Jubilee should draw us closer to our heavenly Father and give us confidence in his interest in us. He is proving that he is our God just as he proved to be to the nation of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Presenting the Good News— On Holidays.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate points in paragraphs two and three, or an approach that would be particularly appropriate for your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">“How Many Can You Reach?” Questions and answers.

<p><span class="font12">Emphasize the need for tactfulness and discretion when evangelizing informally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Interview one or two publishers who do well in this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How Many Can You Reach? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font0">sitting on a bench or in a car. Some are walking and looking. Could you approach them? You may say to yourself: “That would be hard for me. I have never done anything like that before.” While this may be true, most of us never did house-to-house work before we learned the truth either. But with the help of Jehovah’s spirit and our brothers and with good effort on our part we learned how. While approaching people who are away from home may be a new field of service for you, you may find it most rewarding. Why not put forth the effort and learn how to converse with people who are away from their homes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE WHAT THE SCRIPTURES SAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Take a moment, look up Luke 19:1-10 and observe what happened. Jesus was walking through the city of Jericho. He noted an interested man; perhaps he was only a curious man. But who spoke first? It was Jesus. And the results were good. The man heard the truth with appreciation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Notice what Paul did, according to the account at Acts 16:13. He went into an area where he felt there were religiously inclined people. But who took the initiative to approach these people and speak to them? It was Paul. And what was the result? One of the group responded, and the way it turned out, she and her household learned the truth.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Do you remember what Acts 17:17 says? Take a moment and look up the verse. In this case where did Paul go? He went where he knew there would be people he could talk to—the marketplace.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> First there is a need to be friendly. You like it when people are friendly with you, don’t you? And others are attracted to those who are friendly and kind to them. If you can start your conversation in a friendly, warm, complimentary way, you will often find that you get the best response.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> Another point, to get started, be selective as to the people you talk with. Someone sitting on a bench or waiting is usually easier to approach than someone who is walking. At least this may be true at the beginning. A sister may find it easier to approach a woman. If a woman has her baby with her, your showing interest in the youngster may be an easy and effective way to start your</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">conversation on a friendly note. In some areas, because of crime or other factors, good judgment needs to be used in choosing whom you approach. Of course, you brothers are aware of this.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> A helpful observation is also given at Proverbs 15:7. It says, “The lips of the wise ones keep scattering knowledge.” A farmer does not pour out all his seed in one spot, but he scatters it. And a wise man does not pour out all he knows on one person and on one occasion. Just a little at a time may be enough. A sentence or two may be sufficient, then pause and see what response you get. Observe how Jesus did this with the Samaritan woman as recorded at John 4:7-26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> And don’t forget, your picking the right subject may also help you to get </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> hearing ear. So endeavor to discuss a subject that you feel will be of interest to the person with whom you are speaking. It may be a current news item or a point you read in one of the publications or the Bible. After you gain eye contact and start the conversation in a friendly way, where do you go from there? You could offer one of the publications. Or you might choose to show the person an appropriate verse in the Bible on the subject under consideration. If you get a favorable response, fine. If not, you can end the conversation. If interest is shown, you might even suggest discussing the matter further with them in their home, if they wish. If people do not want to talk, you can wish them well and let them know that it was nice to meet them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> Yes, how many more people in your territory can you still reach? Many are effectively reached in the house-to-house activity. But how many more might you reach when they are away from their homes?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">People of all nations can be unified. 1. Why? God is not partial.—Acts 10:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2. How? Acknowledging God's rulership will unify people from all backgrounds. —Rev. 7:9, 10.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—On Holidays</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (Col. 4:6) This fine counsel of the apostle Paul applies to our conversations about Jehovah and his purposes at all times, but especially can we apply this admonition during holiday seasons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Generally speaking, during the holiday season people are in a better frame of mind and are a little more willing to converse about religious matters. We do well to take advantage of their feeling this way by incorporating comments perhaps to this effect: “We note at this time of year that many people are particularly concerned. with subjects dealing with religion, and we are happy to find that. Since the Bible is the basis for true Christianity, now is an especially fine time to read God’s Word.” Then we can go on to consider our topic for conversation from the Bible and offer the easy-to-understand </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World Government</span><span class="font0"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Or we might say: “At this time of year many people are thinking about religious matters and particularly about Jesus Christ. Most know of the ‘Our Father’ or ‘Lord’s Prayer,’ which points out that when the Kingdom comes, then God’s will is to be done on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">earth</span><span class="font0"> as it is done in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heaven. </span><span class="font0">(Read or quote Matthew 6:9, 10.) But will that Kingdom govern the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font0"> earth? Or will it be a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">small, temporary</span><span class="font0"> Kingdom? (Allow for response; then read Daniel 7:13, 14.) That description of Christ’s kingdom shows it will not be weak or temporary. It is the government by which righteous conditions will be brought about world wide.” Then we could go on to offer a Bible study or discuss some point in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World Government</span><span class="font0"> book or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font0"> and present this month’s suggested offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> We want to be tactful and presept the message of truth in a way that appeals to the heart and mind of the householder. It would not be wise to offend individuals unnecessarily with regard to their attitudes about holidays. If they specifically ask how we feel about the subject, we can truthfully, though respectfully, answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> If questions come up with regard to holidays, or if the householder appears to be interested although too busy to talk, we should make a note of this on our house-to-house record. Then we can prepare and call back to give a further witness after the holiday season is past. It would be wise to make our message brief and to the point if people are busy due to having company or getting ready to visit others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Sometimes when we call early in the morning on a holiday such as New Years Day, we disturb people who want to sleep late. Might it be wise to start your house-to-house activity a little later than usual on that day? Or you may feel it would be considerate to start your service by making some return visits first on those you know are in a position to receive you. You will be able to decide what will be appropriate for your territory. We want to present the good news in a way that attracts the householders, and if we can talk to them without disturbing them from their sleep, they are more likely to listen to what we have to say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Presentations ‘seasoned with salt’ can be appealing. We are wise to recognize the feelings of others as we present the good news during the holiday season.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Instructing Your Family? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> As you share in the field service with your children, be sure to include them in the conversation. And by all means, invite those with whom you are talking to express themselves also. All of us enjoy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> conversation when we have a part in it. How can you do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> You might say: “Good morning! My name is .............., and this</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">is my son (or daughter). No doubt you have wondered why world conditions have continued to deteriorate. My son (or daughter) and I have found a Bible verse that we believe will interest you.” [Invite your son (or daughter) to read Proverbs 29:2 and comment if they would like.] Then ask the householder: “Do you believe that those in government may be contributing to the difficulty?” (Allow for response.) Ask the householder if he thinks God has enough interest in mankind so that he will eventually take a hand in world affairs. (Allow for response.) Then you might continue by saying: “Jesus knew that God someday would take a hand in the affairs of mankind and that is why he taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come and God’s will to be done on earth. This publication about the incoming world government will aid you to learn more about God’s kingdom government, and we are offering it, along with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font0"> for $1.25.” As you draw the householder into the conversation, be discerning. You will be able to determine the interest of the householder or the lack of it. You will also be able to determine whether it would be appropriate to offer literature or not.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> When witnessing with your children, do not underestimate how effective young publishers can be in presenting the good news. There are times when they can be more effective than older publishers in reaching certain people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> One father was going from house to house with his two sons, eight and ten years old. In talking to a woman who had ten children, he said: “Children can learn much from the Bible, but they need to understand it.” The woman replied: “Where do you ever see children six and twelve years old reading and understanding the Bible?” The brother turned to his son, who was ten years old, and asked him to read some of God’s promises about everlasting life. The boy read and explained Psalm 37:29. When the woman showed amazement and pleasure, the brother turned to his eight-year-old son and asked him to read and explain Matthew 4:1-11. The woman readily took the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font0">book and a Bible study was arranged with her and her children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> Are you taking time to teach your children the truth and to share with them in the field service? Are you young publishers showing a willingness to study with your parents and accompany them in the field service? You can be sure that Jehovah is pleased with you when you do. Yes, both parents and children are called upon to show appreciation for the family arrangement.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 1977</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Many indeed have been the heartwarming expressions of appreciation received from you regarding the auxiliary pioneer arrangement announced last summer. Truly it is wonderful to see your enthusiastic response to this opportunity to share more fully in preaching and disciple-making, and numerous benefits have resulted from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Many who have found pioneering too great a challenge up to this time now have pleasure in serving as auxiliary pioneers. One of them wrote: “For many years (24 in fact) I have wanted to be a pioneer <sub>k</sub> but lacked stamina. Seventy-five hours was even more than I could handle. Sixty hours is just perfect. Best of all, I can do it continually, month after month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Another publisher, from Ohio, wrote: “Although I had to make some adjustments, it was truly a joy to start off the new service year in this way.” But was this done at the expense of the family? No, all in the family cooperated well and the sister had a fine schedule. She reported: “The entire family benefited from my pioneering. Meals were on time, the children were sent to school on time, our personal study habits were improved as well as our family studies. I am so grateful to Jehovah and to his organization for this wonderful new opportunity to increase our service to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Clearly, such enthusiasm is shared by many. During September and October of 1975 we had 7,611 and 12,846 temporary pioneers respectively. But during the same two months in 1976, after the new arrangement went into effect, we had 16,388 and 21,344, a fine increase indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Think of the many additional ones contacted with the Kingdom message and assisted spiritually, and of the joy this brought to Jehovah’s heart because of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Why We Preach and Teach</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Householders often ask us why we come to their doors to talk about our beliefs. One answer is found in the words of Jesus: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come,&quot; and, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 24:14; 22:39) World wide the witnessing work goes on, as shown in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">1977 Yearbook.</span><span class="font15"> What conclusion is there to draw? Only one, namely, that there is preaching and teaching work yet to be done, that there is still opportunity to demonstrate our love for Jehovah and for fellow humans by sharing in this service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY WE SHARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The answer to the question of what motivates our preaching and teaching lies in the heart of each of us. This is because it is out of the ‘abundance of the heart’ that one’s mouth speaks. (Luke 6:45) When our heart abounds in love for God, it moves us to stand up for Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 40:5-10) To illustrate, if a friend you loved dearly was being falsely accused and you possessed evidence of his innocence, would not your love for him impel you to speak up to clear him, to vindicate him? In the same</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">Make Disciples</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> An important work Jesus outlined for his followers is to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) It is important that those who are baptized have the full opportunity to gain knowledge and understanding and to have appreciation of what it means to be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy spirit. There is also the necessity to teach them to observe all the things that Jesus has commanded. Obviously this requires time. In order to become disciples they have to take in knowledge and be instructed. In many cases the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font15"> book is a basic book that they study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> In the future, when the time comes for considering baptism, the information on pages 18 and 19 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font15"> book will be considered with the candidate. Then there is a review of the 80 questions that are listed, along with the scriptures. In addition to that, it is important that the individual contemplating his baptism and way our hearts are incited to preach and teach the truth about Jehovah our God. Knowing that many people blame God for this system’s wrongs, we want to inform them of ms Kingdom arrangement for correcting all the problems facing the world of mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> And what about our fellowmen who are still part of the world? Those who have not yet conformed to God’s purposes stand in imminent danger of losing their lives. There is no nope without Jehovah’s protection. Yes, they are living in the very shadow of death. If we truly love our neighbor as we do ourselves, we will want to aid all we can to draw close to Jehovah now.—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARE THE TRUTH EACH DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> To share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and to help our neighbors require activity on our part. Are we responding by sharing the Kingdom message at all op-Eortunitics? Are we sharing in the ouse-to-house work regularly? This remains a most effective means of giving all an opportunity to hear the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Do we as well take advantage of opportunities to give an infor-</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font15">dedicated service to Jehovah should see clearly what is involved in this serious step. Therefore, in the future it will be part of the preparation for baptism for the elders to arrange to discuss with baptismal candidates the material in Chapter 6, “Your Service to God,” in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font15"> book. It is not good to rush through the 80 questions, or Chapter 6 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font15"> book. So the elders are encouraged to allow time for this. As soon as they know of a coming assembly, they can make plans to help those who are considering baptism.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Those who contemplate baptism may obtain the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font15"> book when they approach the elders and indicate that it is their desire to be immersed. It is fine if they can read through all the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font15"> book before baptism. But we do want to be sure to go over the 80 questions and Chapter 6 with them. It is preferable to do so on an individual basis rather than doing this in a large group, so that the elder will be better able to see if the individual has the informa-</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> The reports from presiding overseers covering last service year’s activity reflect that a number of publishers have become inactive in our God-given work of preaching and teaching, while others are irregular in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Why have some drifted away or slowed down in sharing the truth with others? Was it tribulation or persecution? Was it the anxiety of this system of things or the deceptive power of riches? (Matt. 13:18-23) What can we do to help our brothers spiritually?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> If some with your congregation are inactive in field service, perhaps even failing to attend the meetings of God’s people, what can you do to aid them? Go to them with a loving and helpful spirit; by getting them to talk, endeavor to determine the cause of their spiritual problem. Helping our brothers, which includes looking after those who are drifting away or need encouragement, is an essential part of our service to God. (Matt. 18:12-14; Acts 11:23) It may be possible to aid them to resume their active worship of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> All elders and ministerial servants who serve as book study conductors should be alert to the spiritual needs of each one in their group. Reviewing the Publisher’s Record cards from time to time will enable them to be aware of trends developing with regard to a person’s field service. When an individual needs help or assistance, the study conductor should give him personal attention or enlist the aid of an experienced publisher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer for March</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Although we have all come to enjoy using the pocket-size books in our field service, we still have a considerable stock of the larger books on hand. Who could benefit from them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The fact is that, by studying these larger publications, many ot us learned the truth. Others, too, can benefit from what they contain. So, instead of leaving them on our shelves, during March we are planning a concerted effort with a view to getting as many of them as possible into the hands of interested persons. Our literature offer during March will be any 50c book, with two free booklets. When you make placements, have in mind trying to start a home Bible study, possibly using one of the booklets that you place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> In addition to offering them in the field, it would be good to make a display of the books at the Kingdom Hall so that publishers and other interested persons who want copies for their library can obtain them before the stock is exhausted.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> If the problem is a failure to report field service, make a greater effort to encourage accurate, prompt reporting. Mention it at the book study near the end of the month and have report forms available there. By directly encouraging and arranging to work personally in field service with those who have become irregular, elders, ministerial servants and other publishers may aid many to regain their joy and satisfaction in doing the divine will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> During the visit of the circuit and district overseers, these brothers will be utilizing more of their time to aid inactive and irregular ones. Early in the week the traveling brother will observe how much aid has been given in the past few months and now it is currently being given. He will do what he can do to assist during his visit, as well as discuss arrangements with the elders for additional care and attention as needed after he leaves.</span></p></li></ul>

If your congregation has more stock on hand than it can place, contact nearby congregations to see if they might assist in getting these books into the hands of the public during March.

It is not advisable to try to study Chapter 6 as one would the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> magazine, but the material can be talked over, perhaps making use of the subheadings as points to be discussed, and considering the scriptures. The time spent by the elders in going over this material is field service time and can be so reported. More than one elder may take turns in discussing the material with one person if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER BAPTISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Much of the instructing of disciples is done following baptism. Jesus stressed the need to teach the newly baptized ones all his commandments. The publishers who are studying with people who get baptized should continue studying with them thereafter. This is part of our field service. The knowledge that a person can get from just one book we do not find to be sufficient to round out his spiritual training and fit him for the work to be done and the pressures that come upon those who serve Jehovah in these last days. We believe that at least two books should be studied with all persons who come into the truth. It is advisable to study the publication that will be most beneficial for the one who has just been baptized. So the study should continue after baptism until the second book has been completed. If you are studying with someone when he is baptized and are in the middle of a book, go right on with the study of that book until it is finished. During that period you will continue to </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">report the study</span><span class="font15"> as a home Bible study and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">count the time</span><span class="font15"> spent in the service while doing this teaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Newly baptized ones appreciate the close association with those who are their fellow servants, especially with the one who found them and has helped them through home Bible study. So we want to encourage more association. This includes taking the new ones out in the field service. It will be good, too, during this period if the elders and ministerial servants become better acquainted with the ones who are newly baptized, perhaps also going in field service with them. We hope the new ones will be attending all the congregation meetings, and will have much pleasure in association with others who are serving as disciples of Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">—With the “Holy Spirit” Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> All persons have need of God’s holy spirit if they are to enjoy a life truly worth living and a hope for the future, for it is the force behind the coming new order! (Gal. 5:22, 23) Yes, our neighbors need to lie informed about God’s holy spirit. They need to see how it can affect their own relationships with other people. This is something that we can all talk about. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font15"> book can also help them to appreciate the reality of God’s spirit so it can become a force in their lives. Three presentations are outlined below as suggestions, but, of course, you can use any other presentation you may desire.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR NEW PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> “Hello. I have been studying the Bible recently, and this Bible verse will help to explain why I have come to your door even though you likely already have a religion. Galatians 5:22, 23 states: [Read it.] Most of us have heard of God’s spirit but wondered iust what it is. Something that will help you to understand how God’s spirit can work in your life is this small Bible handbook. [Display book to householder. Add your own comment on how much the truth means to you.] God promises to put his spirit upon those desiring it. I am sure you will find this Bible handbook very helpful. You may have this copy for 25c.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR YOUNGER PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> “Hello. From discussions at school I can appreciate that man is trying very hard to bring peace to the earth. I wonder, though, if the Bible’s comment here at Galatians 5:22. 23 is not being overlooked. [Read verses.] Did you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Why We Preach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>

While we might not be able to share each day in house-to-house work, almost every day we talk with someone who is not in the truth, a storekeeper, salesperson, friend, relative, and so forth. If we all take advantage of our opportunities each day to share the truth with others through informal witnessing, the prospect of helping many is fine indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOW MORE URGENT THAN EVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• During the past service year 43,900 were baptized in the United States, and we averaged 282,557 Bible studies a month; so with Je-notice that it says a fruit of God’s spirit is peace? So peace comes from God’s spirit. That is what this Bible handbook is all about. [Display it.] You may have this copy for 25c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR ALL OF US</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">* “Hello. I am calling because of concern about the problem many people have in getting along together. I am sure you will agree that we see this almost everywhere—on the job, in the schools and even in the home. What do you think could be done to help people in getting along with one another? [Allow householder to respond.] I would like to get your opinion of what is stated here at Galatians 5:22, 23. [Read.] These qualities come from the operation of God’s spirit in our lives. Don’t you agree, then, that since God’s spirit produces such fine results, it would help people to be interested in one another’s welfare? [Allow for comment.] This book [display it] is designed to help us to understand how we can enjoy God’s spirit and its wonderful fruitage. Notice what it says about the future time when God’s spirit will operate on everyone living on earth. [Read page 181. H36, first two sentences.] The book is yours for a contribution of just 25c.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Feel free to adapt these presentations to your area and what concerns people there or use whatever is appropriate in your territory. If you find a prospect for a Bible study, you may want to give a booklet to the householder and try to start a study. Let us make every effort during the month of February to help people to understand and benefit from the wonderful active force of Jehovah God. —Ps. 143:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">hovah’s blessing, continued growth is expected. Just how much time is left to help others before the “great tribulation” none of us know. (Matt. 24:36) However, we do know that Jesus’ prophecies at Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21 are being fulfilled in this generation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Is it not urgent then that our hearts motivate us to give generously of our time and energy in preaching and teaching while others may yet hear and respond? (Prov. 3:27) Moved by deep love for God and for our neighbor, let us do all we can to share in Kingdom preaching and teaching. —2 Cor. 5:14, 15.</span></p>

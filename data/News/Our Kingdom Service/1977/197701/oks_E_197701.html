<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 1977</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 20, No. 1 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Qeaii</span><span class="font6"> <sup>&lt;</sup>EKing(foin ^ubCisliefts:</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">“Exciting!” was the word we kept hearing from members of the Brooklyn Bethel family. And truly it is hard to describe the thrill and pleasure we all had over what occurred at headquarters during the three weeks of October 18 through November 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Governing Body had arranged for special meetings with the branch coordinators and other representatives of the branches around the earth. In all, 128 brothers attended, and 107 wives accompanied them to work at Bethel during the period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The meetings were not a school, but more of a gathering of elders • to consider Kingdom interests and the worldwide preaching work. It was an excellent opportunity for an interchange of information and encouragement. (Rom. 1:12) In addition to sharing information with these visiting elders, the Governing Body obtained much valuable information from them, such as on the spiritual condition and needs of the brothers in their lands and comments about assemblies, meetings, field sendee, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And how the Bethel family benefited! Many of the visitors had attended Gilead School or spent time at Brooklyn Bethel in years past. So there were many old friends to meet. You can imagine how you would enjoy seeing acquaintances from distant lands each day, being able to converse with them and share experiences at mealtimes and in free evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At each breakfast and lunchtime we were delighted to hear their reports, which were carried to all the six dining rooms and to Watchtower Farms. And following the family </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study each Monday we heard more experiences and firsthand reports from our visitors. Yes, it was thoroughly upbuilding and stimulating.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Endure in Work That Is Good</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Those worshiping Jehovah exclusively have alwavs needed endurance. This wicked system under Satan’s control has been relentless in its opposition. If not suffering outright persecution, we have needed endurance just to persevere in right works while waiting. The year’s text has meaning for each of us: “You have need of endurance, in order that , . . you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.” (Heb. 10:36) Volumes could be written about the uncompromising endurance of true Christians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In modem times, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> magazine has played an important role as an aid to Christian endurance. It has faithfully provided strengthening Bible instruction. (Prov. 4:18) Hundreds of thousands of sincere people the world over have expressed appreciation for its help. Because of Jehovah’s backing and the determination of his people, it has maintained unbroken publication since 1879.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">USING &quot;THE WATCHTOWER&quot; TO H£LP OTHERS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> January will mark the beginning of the thirty-ninth annual </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> campaign. This year arrangements have been made to feature the subscription offer during the months of January, April and July instead of from January through April. The subscription</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Benefiting Even More</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Have you thought about the recent adjustments in the congregational book study and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study? These meetings have been slightly modified, putting us all in position to benefit even more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Since December, in our book study we have been following a schedule set out in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font14"> The schedule for January is in this issue. It is hoped that this has helped you. How? In the past we did not know exactly how far to study ahead in preparing for the book study. As a result there could have been a bit of laxness in preparation as a person got toward the final pages of the material that might be covered in the meeting. Did you ever observe that? But now we know precisely what pages to study, so we can give our full attention to all the material; we can be thoroughly prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Furthermore, each designated lesson is a logical section. Thus there is more unity and coherence as a complete section of related offer on a contribution of $1.50 will include the three new booklets released last year. We will emphasize starting studies wherever possible. It will be quite appropriate to offer subscriptions for both magazines for $3.00 where there is interest. Also, magazine work presents many opportunities to offer the subscriptions, especially to individuals who accept the magazines regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that the real purpose behind our work is to stimulate interest in the Bible. It is God’s Word that people must come to respect and understand. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> will help them to do that. To assist you to focus attention on the Bible, the opening article in each January issue will feature a discussion on a Bible text that you may find helpful in starting conversations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> You might want to use a presentation like this: “Wouldn’t you like to see more people live by the Bible? We are interested in cultivating greater faith in it as God’s Word. The rmcertainty so many feel about the future is enough to convince us that there is a need for that. Wisdom from God, written long ago in the Bible, provides reliable guidance to lead us to a happy future.” (Read Proverbs 3:5, 6; refer to opening article, January 1 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.)</span><span class="font14"> If there </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2) </span><span class="font14">material is considered during a study. We will not find that we have to stop at some awkward point, and the next week begin in the middle of a line of reasoning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">_ USE YOUR BIBLE , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> To some extent the number of Bible texts in a portion of material has had a bearing on the length of the assignment for the week. Do you appreciate what this means? As we prepare we can look up the citations, planning to work some of the texts into our comments. And the conductor will be able to include cited verses in the discussion. Consequently we will be using the Bible more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> As to the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study, have you noted that in the past few months the lessons have often been shorter than in years gone by, actually about 20 percent shorter? This is intentional. Now, while still completing the study in an hour, we will have more time to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEETINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JANUARY </span><span class="font12">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Song 39. Local announcements. Short talk reviewing the Importance of handling subscriptions accurately and promptly. January marks the beginning of another </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">campaign. To ensure proper handling of subscriptions, all are asked: (1) Submit subscription slips </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">in duplicate, </span><span class="font12">doing so at the first meeting after they are obtained. (2) Congregation should send in all subscriptions </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">each week. </span><span class="font12">Always send the remittance form with the subscription slips. (3) When doing so, mark the envelope MAGAZINES. Addresses must be accurate and complete. For every magazine mailed out that is undeliverable, the Post Office charges the Society 25 cents. At the rate such magazines have been returned in the past, this expense could exceed $45,000 a year. Your cooperation will be much appreciated. Also discuss article “Replying to Critics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Discuss article “Endure in Work That Is Good.” Highlight yeartext. Build up enthusiasm for subscription campaign, including one or two brief demonstrations of presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Using Booklets to Start Studies.

We have received suggestions from experienced brothers that you may find helpful: Success in starting studies begins with building up your own desire to help other people. Preparing what you are going to say is also an important factor. An informal approach designed to initiate a friendly conversation usually gets good results. Familiarize yourself with the contents of the booklets, selecting interesting points in the one you want to feature. Here are some ways that have been used to start studies using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a God Who Cares?:</span><span class="font12"> A sister built her presentation around this introduction: “I have been a Bible reader for many years and have been delighted with the way this booklet has dealt with a question that many people have asked about: ‘Why has God permitted wickedness?’ ” (Refer to page 18, paragraph 23.) Another asks the question posed in the title, then refers to the Scriptural answer in 1 Peter 5:6, 7 at the end of page 31. Another used just the Illustration on pages 6 and 7. showing that man. not God, Is responsible for human suffering. All favored use of the Bible with texts marked for handy reference. As time permits, include one or two brief presentations. If local response favors using a different booklet, discuss that instead, offering suggestions for presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Scriptural Discussion: Generosity </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(ad</span><span class="font12"> 642: 12/8/76 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> pp. 27, 28).

Elder (preferably a father) has variety of youths come to platform one at a time: warmly draws each one out on some of these questions, which they have been given beforehand: What do you like most about the meetings? Why? Have you found the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book helpful? In what way? What was the biggest problem you have faced? How did you handle it? Would you enjoy adults talking more with you? About what? What do you think adults in the congregation could do to help you?

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Replying to Critics</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">Newspaper articles, TV programs and radio programs sometimes have information that is critical of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Before deciding to answer in behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses, it is wise to remember that usually the best policy is to ignore the critics, following the example of Jesus, who did not go searching out those critical of him and his message in order to debate or argue with them. ' Moreover, harm can be done if one is not thoroughly prepared to answer or is not experienced in handling controversial questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If a situation is such that the elders believe that the position of Jehovah’s Witnesses should be defended in a community, they might first take it up with the Society, giving all the facts and showing why and how they feel the defense should be made. The Society will then offer some counsel as guidance. But experience has shown that it is usually best to do as Jesus counseled regarding the critical Pharisees: “Let them be.” (Matt. 15:14) Like Jesus, let us keep busy preaching the good news of the Kingdom and gathering the sheeplike ones, not letting the carping of the critics disturb us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting More from Public Talks</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Back in January 1945 public talks in person became a regular part of our weekly meetings. They nave since contributed significantly toward our expanding program of Bible education. The outlines provided have covered a wide range of topics, including doctrinal subjects. More recent outlines deal with everyday problems, exploring the proper application of Bible principles. More than one hundred outlines are available. Additionally, congregations may arrange other talks periodically to fill local needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> If we “pay more than the usual attention,” there is much we can learn that will aid us. (Heb. 2:1) It is helpful for listeners to follow the reading of texts in the Bible. Taking brief notes can provide a handy reference for review later. Also, to grasp new points we can compare our knowledge of the subject with what we are learning from the speaker. It is good to think about specific situations where Bible counsel or principles can be applied in our life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">USING WHAT WE LEARN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We recently had public talks that reviewed material in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font14"> books. Were you alert to note specific points ■mentioned by the speaker? And -».ave you since been able to put these to good use? Here are some examples:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Doctrinal subjects:</span><span class="font14"> One of the talks drew attention to pages 148, 149 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font14"> hook, which highlights the fulfillment of the “sign” Jesus gave. (Matt. 24:325:46; Luke 21:7-36) It also considered page 145, which outlines 38 prophecies proving Jesus to be the Messiah. Another covered the material on page 83 that you might use to convince a skeptical person that the Flood actually occurred. If you were listening closely to the discussion of pages 12-15 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font14"> book, you probably gained additional proof on why there is no basis to believe that the holy spirit is part of a triune God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Shepherding:</span><span class="font14"> Some of the talks presented Scriptural thoughts that the elders can use in their shepherding work. The discussion on chapter 15 in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font14"> book</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Letter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All too soon the meetings were over. But we are sure that all of God’s people will be benefiting from the results of the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Your brothers, </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font14">might provide basis for some encouragement that could help one avoid a variety of pitfalls. Or, a brother depressed with a personal problem might be refreshed to hear you relate details you remembered from the talk describing the paradise discussed in chapter 16. The material in the talk based on pages 132-137 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit </span><span class="font14">book can be used to explain how God’s spirit acts as an “intercessor,” which might be just what is needed to help a person who feels his prayers are hindered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>0</sup> Answering questions:</span><span class="font14"> Public talks provide you with answers to questions that come up in Bible discussions. Do you recall how the speaker, when reviewing pages 127132 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font14"> book, explained how an individual knows he has been spirit begotten? Have persons asked how Moses obtained details about the record of creation and events transpiring in Eden? Very likely that was answered by the speaker in his comments on page 16 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font14"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> These are just a few examples to show how public talks can help us tap a storehouse of information. If you cultivate an interest and pay close attention, you can acquire a wealth of Bible knowledge that you can use for the benefit of yourself and others. Each time you attend the public talk in your congregation, remember the proverb: “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.”—Prov. 1:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Most congregations have found it advantageous to have several book studies conveniently located in different parts of the territory. It has enabled more people to attend regularly, provided a convenient location to meet for service and given us opportunity to get to know and assist one another personally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The elders may feel that it would be advisable to add additional studies or to adjust book study locations. This could be needed if some of the groups have become large or if circumstances change in some homes where studies are being conducted. So, the elders may be interested in knowing about additional homes that are available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> It could be that you have never thought about volunteering your home, assuming that there was no particular need. If your home is suitable in every way for accommodating a book study group and your family is agreeable, why not make that known to the elders? There may be an existing need right now or the elders could be planning something for the future. So, your offer might be a real help toward taking definite steps in that direction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">_<sup>4</sup> All of us should show appreciation for the thoughtfulness of families who volunteer their homes. Christian principles, not to mention good manners, prompt those attending to be lovingly considerate by not going uninvited into other rooms, soiling the carpet or furniture or allowing children to run about unattended inside or outside the home.—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">. <sup>5</sup> Your family may be rewarded in many ways by having a study in your home. Hospitality is a Christian virtue. (Rom. 12:13) Lydia’s strong desire to be hospitable brought her a blessing. (Acts 16:15) Philemon was commended for his kindness, which included having a congregation meet in his home. (Philem. 2, 21) We can make a fine contribution toward the expansion of Jehovah’s organization by showing that we are “ready to share” with others what we have.—1 Tim. 6:17-19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—To Those Who</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Lost Faith in Religion</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In recent years, more and more people have expressed a lack of confidence in religion. Questions have been raised about the existence of God and the value of any form of religious worship. What could we say in a tactful way that might help these people to listen to our message?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In many cases, the individual has simply been disillusioned when he found himself surrounded by hypocrisy and falsehood. Having little Bible knowledge, he was unable to defend his faith. He may be surprised to know it if you were formerly part of a religion like that but lost your faith in it. Mentioning this might give you an opportunity to tell him about what you have found as an alternative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> You may be able to explain that the failure of organizea religion to give him a satisfying hope should not be a cause for him to abandon worship of God. The Bible shows there is true religion and there is false religion; Jesus said that he would tell many professing Christians to “get away from me.” Only those on the ‘cramped road . . . doing the will of my Father’ would have his favor. (Matt. 7:14, 21-23) It is wise to abandon false religion, in fact, we are commanded to do so. —Rev. 18:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Simple logic indicates that there must be a powerful Being responsible for the marvelous universe. We are part of what exists, so it is only reasonable that we try to understand the role we play and ••watHnp Even More &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">savor fine points in the lesson and to make comments of application. There will be less of a feeling of rushing as we consider choice Scriptural material. And, as with the book study, we will be able to look up cited verses and incorporate them in our answers. Hence the meetings will be much more a study of God’s Word, which is so beneficial.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Certainly those who have the joy of conducting these meetings can take advantage of the adjustments to help their brothers to know and use the Bible more. And all of us can look upon these changes as a means to make the meetings more interesting and worth while for all in attendance. what we must do to live in harmony with everything else. That, very simply, is what the true religion will teach us. An attempt to ignore that will simply leave us confused and without any reliable hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> His faith in the Bible may have been undermined, making him reluctant to accept it. Yet, he may be able to see that there are certain laws, rules of ethics and inclinations of conscience that have been proved sound, harmonizing with the makeup of man and the laws of nature. These are invariably in full accord with principles found in the Bible. Most lawmakers admit that Bible instruction surpasses human wisdom. Its pages reveal the only satisfactory explanation as to the origin of man, his purpose on this earth and the remedy for the problems that distress him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> There is a genuine religion that can be easily identified by the good that it produces. It teaches people to love one another. (John 13:35) Personalities are changed, people stripping off what is bad and unclean. (Col. 3:5-10) Those formerly violent are taught how to live in peace. (Isa. 2:2-4) Families are drawn together in a warm, enduring relationship. (Enh. 5:22-33) There are more than two million people earth wide who are enjoying these benefits.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> You may encounter irreligious persons who hold views bordering on atheism, which they readily expound to others at great length. Do not waste time in useless talk where there is no appreciation for what is good. (Matt. 7:6) On the other hand, if someone shows he is open-minded and desires to learn, do what you can to help him to appreciate the pure worship that has moved you to call at his home.—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Without endurance no one can survive the coming tribulation. An understanding of the Bible and a determination to be guided by it are critical needs. Jehovah will reward those who maintain “endurance in work that is good.” (Rom. 2:7) Keeping ourselves busy in the work of teaching and helping others will aid all toward endurance.—Jas. 1:4.</span></p></li></ul>

They are currently receiving the benefit of practical training from 12 experienced instructors whose varying backgrounds include circuit, district, missionary and Bethel service. On the average, these have been baptized for 35 years and have 28 years of full-time service. The same course is being provided in many other lands under direction of the branches. The elders, as well as the congregations, have surely been strengthened by this fine training.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• May the Kingdom Hall be used for a ’'second wedding” ceremony?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In some lands a couple must get married by a representative of the state, such as a Judge, at city hall or the courthouse. That applies to Christians, too. But a Christian couple might want to share the happy occasion with their brothers as well as hear a Bible talk on marriage. So they might ask permission to use the Kingdom Hall in order to follow the civil ceremony with a Bible talk. If such does take place at the Kingdom Hall, it is not really the marriage ceremony, for the marriage actually occurred earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But this two-part arrangement Is not followed by Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States. In this country authorized brothers can perform marriages In the Kingdom Hall. So a coup’ good standing with the congregat &lt;&gt;&nbsp;can request permission to get married at the Kingdom Hall If that Is what they want. Or they may decide to marry elsewhere, at a home, or a rented facility, or to have a civil ceremony at city hall. If they choose to have their marriage at a home or a rented facility or to have a civil ceremony elsewhere, there is no reason to have something additional at the Kingdom Hall later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In some churches of Christendom the idea prevails that a couple must have a &quot;religious wedding&quot; In order for their marriage to be acceptable to God. But that is not the case. (Gen. 24:67) So, if two persons who are free to marry get married by a judge or any other authorized marrying agent, then the marriage is valid before God and the Christian congregation. To go through a &quot;religious wedding&quot; months or years later would suggest otherwise. And because once a couple are legally married in the United States their vows are binding, it would not be fitting to use the Kingdom Hall for a &quot;second wedding” to &quot;renew” those vows. In accord with Jesus' counsel, a married couple can let their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Yes”</span><span class="font12"> mean </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Yes,” </span><span class="font12">viewing their vows as still In force before God and men.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1977</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vol. 20, No. 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">FOR U</span><span class="font1">NITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">kingdom ^PuMisfie/ts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This is really a fine thing that you are doing! It’s going to help all of us in the medical community to understand your position better.” That was what a professor at a medical school enthusiastically said when a Witness sitting next to him on an airplane outlined the coming campaign using the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font3"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Don’t you agree? What a unique witness will be given as we present the new booklet and brochure to all doctors, hospital administrators, judges, lawyers and nurses. In the United States there are some 370, 000 doctors and hospital administrators, 320,000 judges and about 1 million nurses. What a work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now the work and excitement are yours. During October you will have a lot to do: Getting lists of the professional people to be visited, finding out which doctors have Witness patients and making arrangements so that no one is missed. Almost all of us can have a share, but one brother will be coordinating your congregation’s effort. So check with him on any questions you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the time you read this, missionaries in foreign fields will have received the Governing Body’s letter giving them detailed information about the arrangements to help them attend an international convention in their home country next year. Your generous contributions each month for the purpose of making this possible are greatly appreciated. As additional contributions continue to be received, we feel confident that the 1978 Assembly Fund will be able to cover the travel expenses in behalf of those who are to be assisted in this loving way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Bear Witness to the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> In three and a half years, Jesus performed a multitude of good works, ranging from resurrecting the dead to laying the foundation of the Christian congregation. Yet, the purpose of Jesus’ ministry was remarkably simple: ‘To bear witness to the truth.’—John 18:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jesus went to great lengths to teach his disciples many things that they had never before known about Jehovah, making them aware of responsibilities that touched every aspect of their lives. Yet, what was required of them could be summed up in the command to “bear witness” to the truth, by the lives they lived and by their expressing their faith to others.—John 15:27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK ASSIGNED TO THE CHRISTIAN CONGREGATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The work of the early Christian congregation reflected the importance attached to Jesus’ command. Clearly, all that a Christian does in his daily life should be a “witness to the truth,” helping others to embrace the Kingdom hope. Along with this we should feel impelled always to “offer to God . . . the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (Heb. 13:15) Though threatened and abused, the apostles declared: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” —Acts 4:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> With that in mind, the congregation is planning a full month of activity during October, when the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscription will be fea</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You See Your Advancement?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Think back to the time when you first learned the truth. That marked a turning point in your life. Your course took a new direction toward doing the will of God. (1 John 2:17) If you have applied yourself, your advancement should be manifest.—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Advancement is an integral part of true worship. To stand still is to hold back. Every provision of the congregation is directed toward helping us to advance spiritually to the “full-grown man” instead of remaining “babes.” (Eph. 4:11-15) In time, solid spiritual food should replace milk, enabling learners to become teachers.—Heb. 5:11-14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW MANIFESTED?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Advancement can be shown in the disciple-making work. At first, many of us were timid, hesitant to speak up. In time, we began to use tured. Where individuals may not be able to take a year’s subscription, why not offer a six-month subscription and a 25c book, for $1.00? You may have good success doing this.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The October 8 issue has interesting articles on “Races” that you may be able to use to start conversations and direct attention to the reassuring Bible principle stated in Acts 10:34, 35. Or, you may prefer to use another topic. In any event, we encourage you to prepare something before going out so that you can “impart what is favorable to the hearers.”—Eph. 4:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Most of us find that time is in short supply. In deciding how your available time is going to be used this month, do you find that a good share in the Kingdom proclamation is high on your list of priorities, or does it tend to be obscured as something incidental? Remember that time is one of our most valuable resources and wise use of it has a direct bearing on how much we are personally able to do in sharing the good news with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The need for witnessing both by our lives and by our words continues to increase since “the fields . . . are white for harvesting.” (John 4:35) People are becoming more disillusioned so they need to hear the truth. Vigorous activity in “public declaration in front of many witnesses” assures us a “firm hold” on many rich blessings.—1 Tim. 6:11, 12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the Bible to start Scriptural discussions. Have you done that? Have you also followed through, making return visits to start your own Bible study?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Advancement becomes apparent at the meetings. Initially, many are slow to offer comments. As they become more involved and appreciative, they feel motivated to participate. When they realize how the Theocratic School can speed up progress, they are eager to enroll. Very likely you have done that. Do you also take the initiative to approach the instructor for counsel after each talk? This shows a desire to advance and contributes to your progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> It is also good to see evidence of family advancement. At one time, for many of us, there was little to hold our family together. When we </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEEV IGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 102. Announcements. Request each family head to bring name and address of. family doctor(s) and/or lawyer to meeting next week. Read congregation service report for September. Have some relate good experiences involving tract distribution or other activity during September. If time allows, interview some parents about how they learned the truth and how this has been a blessing to the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font12">“Bear Witness to the Truth.” Discuss with audience. Comment on extent congregation as a whole is sharing in declaring the good news locally, offering suggestions where improvement is needed. Outline activity for October, encouraging all to share. Briefly review new subscription rates as outlined in July </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Preparing for Conversations. Success in talking to people depends largely on the extent to which we prepare. October 8 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> features subject of “Races” and related problems. Could use this as a topic for conversation, being careful to avoid controversial aspects. Might begin this way: “I think all of us would like to live in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> peaceful world where we could enjoy some of the better things in life. But, it seems that every effort made to achieve that always ends up in failure because people are divided in so many different ways. Don’t you feel that these divisions separating people around the world are a real barrier to peace and prosperity? [Allow for response.] The prospects for improving the situation would be very dim except for one very encouraging fact: God is not partial and he does not favor any group of people over another. [Read Acts 10:</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">34,</span><span class="font12"> 35.] God has promised that he will soon remove all barriers that divide people, making it possible for them to live in unity and equally share the good things that make life enjoyable.” Refer to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">page 23, for further comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have this presentation demonstrated. Give suggestions on possible ways to adapt conversation to what people in your community are talking about or show how another article in a current magazine could be used. Song 88 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 54. Announcements. Briefly review history and progress of your congregation since it was formed. Show increases and evidences of Jehovah’s direction. Include experiences from older ones who can show progress of true worship in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Can You See Your Advancement?” Questions and answers. Interview some who can tell what helped them to make advancement or some who can tell why advancement can be seen in others. Show how all can manifest their progress in congregation activities this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22 min: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood.</span><span class="font12"> To be handled by brother in congregation who is coordinating campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cover Branch Letter. Tie in facts about number of local hospitals, doctors, and so forth to extent you have obtained such. Highlight benefits. Briefly outline campaign, using points under subheading “Objective” in letter of August 14, 1977. Deal mainly with role of ones in congregation in general in visiting own doctors. Stress why publishers should not take it on themselves to visit all doctors; should check with one assigned to coordinate efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have adults (or family heads) fill out slips, listing own name and name and address of doctor. (In cities having a city overseer, also list congregation name.) Separate slip for each doctor or lawyer. Publishers should also fill out slip for any doctor, lawyer, judge, hospital administrator or nurse that they know on personal basis and so can best approach. Invite suggestions as to obtaining lists, using contacts at hospitals, knowledge of medical or nursing schools, and so forth. Explain that slips will be given back later so publisher can deliver booklet and brochure (or just brochure).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Brief remarks on “Studying the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font12"> Booklet.” Deal mainly with how publishers can best prepare and benefit from three studies; encourage extra preparation. Song 79 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 40. Announcements. Elder discusses with a group of young persons, preferably ages sixteen to twenty-two article “What Are Young Persons Thinking?” in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> of August 15, 1977. Analyze thinking of many youth in world; get comments on how this compares with what they have seen locally. Consider how this information is useful when witnessing to young persons. For example: We can acknowledge that many rely on only themselves. Might link general ‘live-for-today’ outlook with pessimistic view youth have about future, leading into consideration of what Bible says. Could use fact that youths tend to think future will be worse as a way of interesting them in God’s means of bringing better future. Also, comments on how this information might help Witness parents understand better what sons and daughters are exposed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Let Them Praise the Name of Jehovah.” (Ps. 148:12, 13) (Group discussion including an elder, parent, child and study conductor.) Children are a sizable part of every congregation. Bible directs them to attend meetings, make public expression of their faith. (Deut. 31:12, 13; Matt. 21: 16) Their efforts are appreciated. At meetings for service, they sometimes outnumber adults. But commonly reported that children going together cover territory in fraction of time taken by adults. Often just offering two magazines for 10c. Result: Territory covered frequently, but few keep records or call back. Elder discusses problem with group. (1) Parent: Commend for effort to study with family, bring to meetings and aid them to share in service. Should see that they are prepared, equipped in advance. If at all possible, should accompany to supervise conduct and training. Fine way to follow up training in family study. (2) Child: Commend for willingness to share in service. (Eccl. 12:1) Relate examples showing how young publishers got good results. How youngsters can help: Take seriously. Prepare in advance. Keep record of placements, follow up interest. Maintain proper decorum. Be respectful of adults. (3) Study conductor: Discuss ways to organize group to minimize problem. Can encourage parents to shoulder their responsibility; offer practical suggestions and help. When working from car, parent may take two or three children, letting them take turns accompanying. Check on them regularly in the territory. Encourage them to follow up placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As time permits, get expressions from audience of what various ones have done to help children “praise Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Elder discusses with audience ways that all can help our young people through example and encouragement. Reassure young people of our interest in them. Discuss pressures at school, need to be able to talk to parents or mature fellow Witnesses. In trying to help them, one congregation found: Many felt older ones did not talk to them. Most wanted the elders to go with them in service. Invite young people to express themselves. Discuss ways all could show more personal interest in them, for their encouragement. Mention any point of counsel needed by young people locally, giving kindly, upbuilding advice. Close meeting urging all to rely on Jehovah. (Isa. 40:30, 31) Song .97 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 38. Announcements. Include Accounts Report. “The Problems of Working Women.” (p77 9/8 p. 7) Brother discusses main points of articles with three or four sisters to show how information can help us in service. W’hat adjustments might we have to make in view of this situation in many homes? What could be done to contact many who are not at home? Why are women often busy when we call? What topics for conversation might be of greater interest to most women? Invite audience to comment as time allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Prepare locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Getting the “Spirit” of Jesus’ Field Instructions. If Jesus were to conduct a meeting for service, we would all be there and listen. He did! Matthew chapter 10. Instructions given to twelve apostles before they were sent out by two’s. Analyze how we can apply his counsel locally. (1) Note how he felt about people s spiritual needs. (Matt. 9:35-38) “So,” (Matt. 10: 1) sent forth apostles. While no authority to heal sick, do we feel “sent forth”? (Vs. 5) We should. (Matt. 24: 14) (2) What should we stress? (Matt. 10:7) Urge them to look into Bible where Kingdom is dominant theme. (3) (Vs. 8) Not only refrain from charging for witness given, but demonstrate attitude of generosity—really want to give of self. This will keep us going with right motive. Verses 9 to 14 deal with instructions regarding staying in homes of the people. While we seldom do this today, learn from attitude Christ taught. Positive wishing of peace toward householders and only if they do not allow you to help them do you ‘shake dust off your feet.’ Not negative view of people, rather hoping for good outcome. How can this outlook be kept? (4) (Vss. 16-22) Apostles going into hostile territory; local religious leaders would instigate trouble. Since they must declare good news among wolflike opposers, should be “cautious as serpents”—moving away from trouble where they could, not foolhardy—yet innocent of any wrong,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">not repaying in kind to opposers. How do principles apply locally? If arrested, should not worry about what to say before courts; holy spirit helps. Does not mean we should refrain from preparing for field service, but shows we should ask for God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What can we learn from Matthew chapter 10? Should follow Jesus’ example: Be genuinely concerned about people; avoid confrontation with opposers when possible; highlight tne Kingdom hope; do not cease telling out the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are still under his command and have his assurance that as we continue, he is with us. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Encourage audience to bring new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font12">book next week. Song 24 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 72. Announcements. &quot;Approaching Your Doctor.” To be handled by brother in the congregation who is coordinating the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Discuss how to go about seeing family doctor (or lawyer). Why it is best to be brief, clear, kind. Short demonstration of brother presenting booklet and brochure to doctor. (Follow wording in article.) Urge all to get ideas in mind, then put in own words. We are not trying to get each doctor into a long discussion, but want to encourage him to read material. Explain why some may be asked to deliver only brochure to their family doctor. Call attention to what to write on back of brochure. Could also demonstrate very brief presentation of booklet, and possibly brochure, to friend who is a nurse. During meeting or afterward, return slips to publishers with matching supplies. (If it is certain that there will be ample brochures for campaign, you could give each publisher or family head a personal copy to keep. We will not use brochure in field service.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Holding Fast Our Integrity. Scriptural discussion. What is this godly quality and how can we hold fast to it? (1) Define: Moral soundness, blamelessness, completeness. Christian integrity is not to an ethic or ideal but to a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">person,</span><span class="font12"> Jehovah. (Ps. 26:1-3) (2) Hold fast in Jehovah’s strength and because we love him and do not want to lose relationship with him. (Ps. 119:1-3) (3) Job's experience reveals issue involved and right course to follow.—Job 2:3-5; 27:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Consider -with audience ways integrity is tested in matters of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">daily conduct, </span><span class="font12">not just when violently persecuted. (4) Why are young Christians today often faced with great tests of integrity? (Eph. 5:3-5) (5) How can those in divided households face difficult trials? (Matt. 10:35, 36) (6) Stress the means for relief in all circumstances: Prayer, begging for holy spirit, study with view of keeping faith strong, drawing comfort from elders and others in congregation. (Phil. 4:6, 7) Is it possible, although being imperfect, to remain blameless? In Bible sense of word, Yes. Not absolutely perfect but devoted at heart like David. (1 Ki. 9: 4) (7) Benefits: Clean conscience and sure hope for future. Avoid frustrations and confusion of those in world.—Ps. 37:18, 19, 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">&quot;Presenting the Good News —With the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font12"> Book.&quot; Discuss offer for November, making comments regarding what approaches may be effective in your territory. Demonstrate two of these. May need to discuss what arrangements would help most in striving to reach college students in territory, since it is often not possible to visit dormitories on campus. Song 44 and prayer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Approaching</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> As announced at the district assembly, in November we will have a special campaign with the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font3"> booklet and brochure. How, though, can you best do your part in the campaign?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> First, there is the matter of getting to see your doctor. Perhaps you can simply stop by his office and ask to speak with him for a minute or two to give him some material for your medical file. Or you might choose to phone ahead and ask his secretary “for a two-minute appointment, not as a medical visit, but just to leave with him some information and to give him a document to put in the family medical file.” Make it clear that you will be brief. Of course, if you have or want a regular appointment anyway, that would be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a fine</span><span class="font3"> time to present the booklet and brochure to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> When speaking with him, you could </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in your own words</span><span class="font3"> make a few brief comments, such as: “As you know, I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and so for religious reasons I do not accept blood. In order to help you in treating me (and my family), I want to give you an interesting new booklet that each doctor, lawyer and judge in the country is receiving. I’m sure you’ll find the medical and ethical information interesting. Also, I’d like you to read this short brochure and add it to my medical file. I’ve signed this document, so you can see that it represents my position.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Remember, the principal reason for our objection to blood is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religious,</span><span class="font3"> so there is no reason to argue with the doctor about the medical aspects of blood. Be sure to express your appreciation for his continued care and consideration. And assure him that you respect his skill and dedication as he treats you (and your family) in accord with your religious convictions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Before visiting the doctor, you can write (or type) at the bottom of page four of the brochure something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Dear Doctor ..............................:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The above represents my own personal beliefs as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. For religious reasons I (and my family) cannot accept blood transfusions. I am willing to bear full responsibility for this, and I appreciate your respect for my convictions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signature)”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> You can sign it ahead of time, or when you are with him. Be friendly, kind and understanding. If he asks some questions or makes comments, you can direct his at-</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Your Doctor</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">tention to appropriate points in the booklet or brochure. In any event, be sure to urge him to read the brochure before adding it to your permanent medical file.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> If your family uses a lawyer, present the booklet and brochure to him, mentioning that it contains information on an issue that many in the legal field are concerned about. Tell him that all doctors, lawyers and judges are receiving copies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Also, if you are personally acquainted with any nurse, lawyer, judge or medical doctor (as well as medical or law student), check with the brother coordinating this campaign about presenting the booklet and brochure to that person. When speaking with such an acquaintance, simply make brief observations about the importance of the topic and the extent to which the material is being distributed. Urge him to read this new material.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Studying the “Blood” Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How fine it is that before our important November campaign with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font12"> booklet we will cover it in the congregation book studies! The nature of the material will mean that all of us, and especially the conductors, will need to put extra effort into our preparation. But just how will we study the booklet since it has no questions at the bottom of the pages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We will use the subheadings (as on p. 4) and bold-faced questions in italics (as on p. 5), which focus attention on the key thoughts that we want to fix in our minds. For example, after having read from the subheading on page four to the end of page six, the conductor could ask the italicized question on page five. Next, read from the top of page seven to the middle of page nine and then ask the question at the top of page seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Where there are no italicized questions between subheadings, the conductor can pose a question that will bring out the main point. For instance, after the reading from the subheading on page 40 to the next subheading, he mignt ask: &quot;How could we show someone that each person’s blood is complex and unique to him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Both in our preparation at home and at the study itself we should try to isolate the main elements or facts. There is no need to mention every detail. But if we grasp the basic thrust of the arguments, we can later use these in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In view of the amount of pages to be read during the second and third studies, it may be necessary to extend the meeting by fifteen minutes or so. This is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for these two weeks only.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">1. Divisions between people have been a barrier to peace and economic prosperity.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">you feel God cares about us? Some people have doubts because there is so much suffering and injustice in this world. Many have reasoned that since there are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">billions</span><span class="font3"> of people on this earth, How could I ever expect God to notice or care about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">met</span><span class="font3"> Perhaps you may have felt that way at times. If so, let me show you something very reassuring from the Bible. [Read Acts 10:34, 35.] This shows that everybody has an equal opportunity before God, who is impartial. He is genuinely interested in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font3"> individual who is obedient to his will. That means that he is personally concerned about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font3"> well-being and would be pleased to see you gain salvation. Note what is stated here: [Refer to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> book, page 108, 5|2. Read first sentence and 1 Timothy 2:4 as quoted.] This is assurance to you and me that we can personally draw close to God and he will provide what we need for a happy and secure future.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> If your territory includes a college or technical school, you may want to make a special point of thoroughly covering it iii appropriate ways during November. Young persons are frequently eager to discuss the purpose of life. This publication explains the purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> We have in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> book a publication that deals with the views of many persons today. By our flexibility we can succeed in leaving the book, and, more importantly, can aid some to learn the answers ' to their questions concerning a , Creator and the purpose of life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">personal pursuits is now being used in more worthwhile ways. Instead of an unconcerned attitude, toward others, now you have a genuine interest in helping them. (Gal. 6:10) If you have progressed to the point where the value of all things is determined on the basis of how they affect your relationship with Jehovah, you can feel confident that you have ‘pressed on to maturity’ and are in line to “inherit the promises.”—Heb. 6:1, 12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Can you see evidence of this kind of advancement in your life? Of course, all are different and progress varies according to individual circumstances. No one should judge another. (Rom. 14:4) Each can assess the extent of his own advancement, seeking to improve in areas where his progress has been slow. Rest assured that Jehovah will continue to help you.—Col. 1: 9-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">With the &quot;Life&quot; Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> We live in a time of increasing skepticism. Many people doubt the existence of a Creator. Others view him as a cold, remote Being—unconcerned about mankind. People do not realize how much their view concerning God affects their lives. We know that without a relationship with Jehovah life lacks purpose. But how can we help them? Our new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life Does Have a Purpose,</span><span class="font3"> can change their thinking. It deals with many of the objections regarding a Creator. With fine logic, the book builds appreciation for what Jehovah has done and will yet do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Now how can you use the book to good advantage? Here are some suggestions: First, get acquainted with its contents. What chapters might be effective in your territory? . <sup>3</sup> In your area, are people skeptical about the very existence of a Supreme Being? Then chapter 1, “Life </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Does</span><span class="font3"> Have a Purpose,” would be powerful. Use some of the questions raised in that chapter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Or, do the householders generally accept the idea of a God but feel that he has little </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">personal concern</span><span class="font3"> for them? Then you may wish to use chapter 10, “Does God Coimt You Personally Important?” Strive to think in terms of what approach will lead to meaningful conversations. Often, these will, not only permit you to place the book, but lead the way to a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In speaking to the householder, you might pose this question: “Do </span><span class="font1">Advancement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">put emphasis on spiritual things, common interests began to draw us together. We found that doing things together could be enjoyable. Has that been your experience? It may be that now you plan together as a family for recreation, meetings and field service, as well as for regular family discussion of God’s Word. Surely you will agree that bridging the communication gap, learning to express ourselves freely and respectfully, is a major factor in advancing spiritually as a family.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Advancement can be manifested in other ways. When you were new, you may still have tended to evaluate things by worldly standards. As your spirituality increased, you began to view things from a spiritual standpoint. (1 Cor. 2:14-16) If your spirituality has continued to grow, likely you have found that much time formerly consumed in</span></p></li></ul>

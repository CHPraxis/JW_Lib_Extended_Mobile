<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 1977</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 20, No. 8 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is most encouraging for us to see so many brothers and sisters now sharing in the auxiliary pioneer service. This past April there were 26,021 auxiliary pioneers in the United States as compared to 13,829 in April 1976. The South Sacramento, California, congregation, with a total of 133 publishers, reported 70 auxiliary pioneers during March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recently some members of the Bethel family have been able to do auxiliary pioneer service while still caring for their Bethel assignments. So the new schedule for auxiliary pioneers certainly helps more brothers and sisters to get more time in the field service. This opens the way to many encouraging experiences and blessings m the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Good news has come from Portugal. During the visit of the zone overseer, Lisbon’s Restelo Stadium was jammed with 43,804 people, about 19,000 of whom were publishers and the remainder, interested persons. What a thrill it was to our Portuguese brothers to see Jehovah giving the increase! Fine reports appeared in the newspapers. And how did the Lisbon police react? One officer said: “Everything here is so well organized, we’re not needed.” The brothers are looking forward to using the stadium for their district assembly in Lisbon this summer. In Spain, during the visit of the zone overseer, the brothers rented a bullring in Madrid and packed it out with 16,612 persons. The next day, at a bullring in Barcelona, 27,215 were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We hope that all of you will enjoy a good month in the service in August to close out the 1977 service year. May Jehovah’s rich blessing be with you as you continue serving faithfully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivate tl:e Ability to Speak</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In carrying out Jesus’ command to preach and teach, to make disciples and to baptize them, it was clearly evident to the early Christians that they must speak to others about God’s Word. They learned to be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">outspoken,</span><span class="font11"> as it were, for the truth. Of the Jews who heard Peter and John speak, the record at Acts 4:13 says: “Now when they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Yes, for good reason the Jews wondered at how those common men, former fishermen, became so very forceful and bold in their public speaking. And so the record (Acts 4:13) says: “And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus.” Peter and John had studied the Scriptures; they were Bible students. They learned from Jesus, their Teacher, and they cultivated the ability to speak, appreciating that they must do this in order to carry out Jesus’ commands. Thus, with the further help of God’s holy spirit, they were used to spearhead the publicspeaking and preaching activity of the early Christian congregation.—Acts chapters 2 to 5.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Families, Worship Jehovah Together</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> All of us have certain responsibilities as Christians. We know we must study God’s Word, attend Christian meetings, conduct ourselves properly as Christians and engage regularly in the field service. Some brothers have responsibilities in the congregation as elders or ministerial servants. Parents have an additional responsibility— their children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> God’s Word describes children as an inheritance from Jehovah God. (Ps. 127:3-5) It is a serious thing to receive an inheritance from the Creator. How are you parents caring for it? Lives are involved, both yours and your children’s. Certainly vour responsibility to care properly for your children is one that you do not want to sidestep or shift to others. Jehovah as a wise Father lovingly provides aid and counsel in his Word. (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 13:24) Wise parents should seek out Jehovah’s help, as Manoah did centuries ago.—Judg. 13:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Many parents in the truth today have grown up in Jehovah’s organization, greatly appreciating its provisions. Some were young folks themselves in 1941 and received the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font11"> book when it</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU PRAY FOR IT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Christians today must likewise be bold and outspoken in spreading the message of truth. Do you pray for outspokenness as did the early Christians? (Acts 4:29) The record shows that Jehovah answered their prayer.—Acts 4:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The apostle Paul was an excellent example of one who cultivated the ability to speak. When at Ephesus on his third missionary tour, Paul “spoke with boldness for three months, giving talks and using persuasion concerning the kingdom of God.” (Acts 19:8) It should be noted that Paul was </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font11"> just relying on any natural ability he had, for he later wrote to the Ephesian congregation: “Carry on prayer . that ability to speak may be given me.” (Eph. 6:18-20) Do you pray on behalf of yourself and fellow Christians for the ability to speak, as did Paul and the other early Christians?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU WORK FOR IT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> AH of us, young or old, male or female, need to cultivate the ability to speak the truth well. This requires work. Do you work to cultivate speaking ability? Paul </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2) </span><span class="font11">was released at the St. Louis convention. That fine book, along with later ones such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font11"> and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book, helped them to gain basic Scriptural knowledge. With good parental discipline and care they grew up as spiritually strong servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">USE &quot;YOUTH” BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* Parents and children now have available for use another timely provision: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It.</span><span class="font11"> What an excellent aid to parents in discharging their Christian responsibilities! Many have already gone through it with their children. Have you? Whether communication problems exist or not, this book should open up channels of thought to enable you to find out what your children have on their minds, yes, and what is in their hearts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Certainly the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book is an excellent publication for families to use in their family discussions. These do not have to be formal question-and-answer studies. In fact, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book is arranged for group discussion so the entire family can be involved.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEETINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 3X</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Song 110. Announcements. Discuss benefits of field service. Ask audience. Why do you personally go out In the field service? How Important do you feel It Is? If territory Is covered often, why do we keep on announcing the good news? Do you feel that you personally benefit by participating in the field service? Are there anv Christian qualities that you develop by participating in field service? (Endurance, Joy, self-control, fearlessness, love, ana so forth) (Acts 13:48, 52; Phil. 1:14, 18, 19: Acts 5:42) Good news proclaimed; people in Held thus benefit. Publisher who preaches Is built up and encouraged, assisted to retain Scriptural Information by repetition in field service. Congregation benefits, doing things together; Improves spirit, more spirituality; a force for unity in congregation; new ones helped to grow to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Presenting </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security </span><span class="font9">book. Topic for Conversation on Luke 21 lends itself well to discussing hope for secure future. Get all publishers Involved In consideration of experiences had last month in using this topic. What approach worked out well for you in the territory? Did you vary It somewhat for certain persons such as Souths, businessmen, and so forth? Are lere any local events that would tie In easily with this theme? Since many people give attention to world news, nave you used current events in newspapers as an aid to reach a common ground for conversation on this subject? Ask publishers to relate points they find appealing In your kind of territory. Then consider how one might tie in topic with pages 82 and 83 in book. Also subheadings in Chapter 9 can well be used to show hope for future as promised by God. Ask publishers which points in book they think will be easy for them to use to reach minds of local people. All publishers should understand that they may use whatever points they find effective and easy to handle. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font9"> book may also be ottered during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Organize for Evening Witnessing In August. (Elders should get together before meeting and prepare suggestions for evenings for service and places to meet.) Which evening Is best for your congregation? for your book study? for your family? (Elders can take initiative to suggest a good evening.) Most families of publishers are together In evening—good opportunity for families to enjoy service together one evening during week. Many find house-to-house activity enjoyable at this time. Often many people are not at home weekdays, but can be found home evenings. People more relaxed, not rushed, many listen. Can also do street witnessing In evenings In safe areas where stores are open; people on the street can be approached ana they often take time to talk. What Is a good night for your group or family? Some pioneers find best time to talk to people at home is from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Find out by experience what is best time for evening witnessing in your territory. In addition to witnessing at usual hours, by witnessing evenings we may meet many people not previously contacted. If territory Is covered frequently. group can follow up on not-at-nome notations from House-to-House Record forms. With many people, at what other times do we see them? Take advantage of summer evenings, including Saturdays, witnessing In cities or rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discuss how to approach people in evenings, in easy, neighborly way. Arrange In advance for those who have done evening witnessing to express themselves on pleasantness of It and what they did to reach the people at that time. Encourage publishers, families and Individuals, to get together and make choice of evening during week for service. Try it out during August, see the good results, and you may want to continue into September and months to come.

As Christians we </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> have responsibility to speak and should desire to speak well. (Prov. 25:11; 2 Tim. 1:13) We always Improve In any endeavor as we work hard and spend time at It. The more we talk, the more we will enjoy it. So our mental inclination should always be to improve our ability to speak the words of truth so as to help others gain the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. (John 17:3) If time permits, speaker can refer to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font9"> (p. 1332) or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Make Sure&quot;</span><span class="font9"> (p. 348) material.

Discuss with audience the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(1) Jehovah Is the Originator of family arrangement. He established the first human family. (Gen. 2:22-24 : 5: 1-5) In ancient Hebrew society the family was the basic unit. It was also a 'small government,' with the father as head being responsible to God. Today same arrangement prevails In Christian congregation. The family Is the basic unit of Christian society with the father as head. (1 Cor. 11:3) Christian parents, particularly fathers, with assistance of mothers, have responsibility to train children In discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah. (Eph. 6:4) Children, In turn, are to obey and respect their parents. (Eph. 6:1-3) Parents train children through family and congregational meetings for Bible Instruction, like Hebrew parents. (Deut. 6:6, 7: 31:12. 13: Neh. 12:43) Also must train In witnessing, teaching them to speak out truth to others they meet. This, too. Is an Important part of our Christian worship. (Matt. 28: 19, 20; Rom. 10:10, 13-15) Philip the evangellzer, a good example. He had four daughters who prophesied; thus, must have trained them well In public service of Jehovah.—Acts 21:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(2) Christian families today should appreciate need to work together In field service. How are you doing In field service as a family? (You are welcome to consult your Publisher Record cards after the meeting.) Working together is a fine way to strengthen the family unit and relationship of one member to the others, especially parents to children. It Is best for parents to shoulder their responsibility and try to avoid sending children In field service while they remain at home, unless circumstances warrant such. Get comments on the following questions: What do you do to make your service as a family enjoyable? Do you do anything special for younger children In particular to help them enjoy and appreciate field service? What local opportunities are there for families to enjoy service together? Would evening witnessing be a good time for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font9"> family to work In service together? Or, if Sunday morning meetings are held, could </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font9"> family work together in service some Sundays for a while after the meeting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(3) Include one or two experiences of families who have worked together on a regular basis. How Is it arranged? When? What are the benefits to the family? Do you recommend this for other families? Conclude with encouragement to all elders with families to be sure they spend time with their </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font9"> families In the service, helping them as well as others. All families should appreciate need to work together In </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> things. Including field service, In order to keep strong spiritually In this time of the end. (Phil. 3:16, 17) Song 60 and prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Song 55. Announcements. Mention that experiences from evening witnessing will be on program next week.</span></p>

Do we let objections stop us, or can we sometimes use them as a springboard to further discussion and enlarge on our Scriptural hope?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">i This year the entire month of September will be the month for putting out a new tract. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">This campaign will be different.</span><span class="font9"> The tract is designed to be the basis for many good conversations. So. In many cases we will not simply be leaving tracts for people to read later. The theme of the tract will be the family, and this should be of Interest to the majority of people we meet. There are points set out In clear and logical arrangement so you will be able to use the tract readily In conversations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">z The conversations can lead to Bible studies, and this will be our objective In September. Once a conversation has been entered into, you may be able to go from the Scriptural consideration based on the tract to Chapter 20 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book on “Building a Happy Family Life.” In most cases you might find It best to start at the beginning of the chapter. Familiarize yourself with the tract and the chapter in the book. Then you can adapt to whatever the conversation reveals to be the aspect of family life that Is of special interest to the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">s Where will this work be done? Elders and study conductors should lay plans during August for each study group's work program. Select the territory and arrange definite places to meet. Have someone there to take the lead. The weather should be favorable for getting to different towns and population centers. Again, this year, the Society will consign a supply of tracts to each congregation. Tracts will be left where people are busy or not at home, but starting conversations will be one of our main goals in the tract work this September. All tracts should be distributed by the last day of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">« September will be a month of special activity. How many in your congregation will be able to share In auxiliary pioneer service? Those who are pioneering will be able to work with groups and help newer ones to go out in the service. Enjoy this new use of tracts as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">speak? One way would be by preparing well all assignments we have in the Theocratic School. We should all seek to apply points of counsel given and to improve our speaking ability with each talk we give. The same would also be true of brothers who have assignments in the service meetings or who deliver public Bible talks or read at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. The more we speak, the better we can do it. As we go from house to house we must all try to speak well and to speak boldly. More success will be realized if we prepare ahead of time so that we know well the topic for conversation we plan to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is good to remember that bold speech does not mean rude speech. We are wise to use tact and discernment, which things are included in cultivating the ability to speak. (Col. 4:6) Surely Jehovah will bless our work and answer our prayers so that we might cultivate the ability to speak the Word with boldness.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During August we will be offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book as an alternative offer to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font11"> book. Surely we will have many fine opportunities to offer this excellent Bible study aid in the field service as we go from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Especially is this true as we meet teen-agers. We should not feel that we must always ask to speak to their parents. Rather, why not take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the young person, knowing that we have a fine Bible study aid designed just for him or her? If interest is shown, we could ask, “Do your parents let you choose what you read?” If the answer is affirmative, then certainly it would be proper to offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book. If negative, we could explain the purpose of the publication and offer to call again to speak to one of the parents, if they are not at home right then.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> What topic for conversation could we use? One that has been suggested is: “How can a young person make a success out of life?” This is based on Psahn 1:1-3, which is an excellent scripture to use in conversation with teen-agers. You may wish to start </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> conversation using this suggestion and then offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book. Or, some find it good first to turn to the Table of Contents in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font11">book to show the young person how applicable it is to the life of a teen-ager. Ascertain what might be of particular interest, and then follow through with Psalm 1:1-3, indicating how the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book, along with the Bible, can assist a young person.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Where can we find young people? Besides locating them in the house-to-house work, we can search them out in other places. For example, young people can be found at summer camps, in the vicinity of summer schools or in recreational areas. Could you arrange to go to such places in your territory and speak to the young people? One pioneer wrote us: “Last month I offered the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">book from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Parents should not overlook the fact that many of their workmates on secular jobs have children.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> And you young publishers, you have a special advantage. You know the problems and questions of youth very well. You also know how valuable the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book is in solving these problems and answering these questions. So take advantage of opportunities to talk to your schoolmates, youths in your neighborhood, and relatives, to see if you can help them and let them know how much </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font11"> appreciate the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> With many schools preparing for new terms, it is a good time to pursue another avenue. Why not visit teachers, principals and school counselors? Acquaint them with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book and show them how practical it is in helping young people. Let them know how you have benefited from the information in it. Inform them that this publication is available to them and to their pupils.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC NEWS </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Japan is very happy to report over 40,000 publishers for the first time. In March they had 40,005 reporting. The publishers were encouraged by the timely visit from the zone overseer who repre</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">sented the Governing Body.</span></p><img src="oks_E_197708_files/oks_E_197708-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:143pt;height:29pt;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">• Our Kingdom, Service</span><span class="font9"> of February 1977 says “that at least two books should be studied with all persons who come into the truth,” and it points out that a study should be continued with a student who gets baptized until he has finished studying two publications. Would this point apply to someone baptized a year or so wno may not have finished studying two publications?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is certainly good for newly baptized persons to become firmly rooted in the faith and in Christian principles through a personal study of the Scriptures. (Col. 2:7) Obviously, much of the learning process for a new disciple must </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">follow</span><span class="font9"> baptism. (See Matthew 28: 19, 20.) So if it is felt that a baptized publisher definitely needs personal help in order to complete a thorough study of at least two of the Society’s publications in the home Bible study arrangement, then certainly someone should study with him. In such a case the study should be reported and the field service time and return visits should be reported by the one conducting the study </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">until</span><span class="font9"> such time as two publications have been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are a regular attender at the congregation book study, you may find you are getting the spiritual upbuilding you need. However, If you nave not completed two books and feel that you or your family need additional help, why not approach the Bible study overseer and ask if someone can conduct a study with you?</span></p>

Also, you will find that in most chapters there are a number of scriptures cited at the bottom of the pages.

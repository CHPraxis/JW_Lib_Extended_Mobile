<p><span class="font12">Last month we mentioned that a number of brothers have been making zone visits in various parts of the earth. Since their return we have enjoyed hearing their reports. So, we want to take this opportunity to share some encouraging points with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Despite opposition from the clergy and certain local chiefs over the years, excellent progress is being made in the islands of the South Pacific. At times, when witnessing is done on islands where there are no Kingdom proclaimers, people plead with the brothers to stay longer and help them to learn the truth. Efforts are being made to reach all populated islands and atolls with the “good news,” but more workers are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In parts of Australia where the population is very scattered, brothers may travel over a hundred miles to attend a meeting or to share in the field service. What an example they are setting in showing appreciation for spiritual things!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was encouraging to hear what is happening in South America. In Ecuador, for example, when a family began to study the Bible, their relatives became greatly concerned. One of them, an ardent Catholic schooled in theology, agreed to visit the family with a view to encouraging them to stop their study. During the month’s stay in their home, the husband and wife invited the seminarian to share in their morning discussions of the daily text, attend their weekly family study and accompany them in the field service as well as to the weekly meetings at the Kingdom Hall. He was so delighted with what he learned that, upon his return home, he progressed to the point of baptism even before his relatives. This, former seminarian is now a ministerial servant in his home congregation. Meanwhile, other relatives visited the family with the same intent as the seminarian. The re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Faithfully </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Pursue &quot;The Way&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>True worship is “The Way,” that is, it is a manner of life that centers around faith in Jesus Christ and imitating his example. (Acts 9:2; 24:14) Since the day of Pentecost of the year 33 C.E., this has been the best way of life. Have we not seen abundant evidence to this effect in the lives of our brothers and sisters? Think about your own life. Has not applying Bible principles brought good results? Have you not been encouraged and strengthened by Jehovah’s answering your prayers? Has not your Christian hope sustained you in times of stress? And how thrilling is the prospect of life in God’s new order, to be attained either by a resurrection from the dead or by surviving the “great tribulation”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> So, we have good reason to recommend “The Way” to others. It is a tried and tested way of life that has enabled many thousands to cope successfully with common problems of life and has also sustained them in times of trial—sickness, hunger and even torture. This is “The Way” that could help many more people today. It could save families from breaking up, youths from drug addiction and it would give all who accept the “good news” a real</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Love for Jehovah, his Son, and our fellowmen should motivate us to share regularly in field service. Nevertheless, some brothers find that it is not always easy to proclaim the “good news.” They may be nervous about approaching strangers and concerned that they cannot express themselves as well as others can. At times they may feel discouraged. Have you felt that way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This is not something unusual. Note what the apostle Paul said to the Corinthians: “I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling.” (1 Cor. 2:3) Why? The apostle was concerned as to how he might make known the truth under circumstances very different from what he was used to as a Jew instructed by the learned Pharisee, Gamaliel. But he did not allow this to hold him back from declaring the “good news.” And Paul was successful, not because of his personal ability to persuade, but because of the fine help provided through God’s spirit. We, too, with the help of purpose in life and a solid hope for the future. Truly, our fellowmen urgently need the truth now. Are you zealously recommending it by your own example and by seizing the opportunity to witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Though this ungodly system has not yet ended, being a witness for Jehovah continues to be the right way and the best way of life. True Christians have always been confident that their approved standing with the Almighty is something worth enduring for, yes, dying for. They were happy to share in vindicating God’s name and in proving the adversary a liar. Surely the lives of thousands of Christians who suffered a violent death throughout the centuries, including our own twentieth century, were not spent in vain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The fact that God’s righteous new order was not ushered in during the lifetime of first-century Christians did not mean that, they could put the advancement of spiritual interests in a secondary place. Their time for proving themselves faithful and for helping their fellowmen was limited. That is why the apostle Paul and others werrked so diligently during their lifetime to make disciples. As a result of their zealous activity, by the year </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">God’s spirit can succeed in giving a witness and in helping honest-hearted ones to become praisers of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Remember, the Most High has not chosen the wise and intellectual ones to represent him. For the most part, these have been too proud to respond favorably to the “good news.” The situation today is still as described at 1 Corinthians 1:26, 27: “Not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth; but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame.” In using the ones whom the worldly wise look down upon as foolish, Jehovah God puts such wise ones to shame. He makes it clear that he does not need them to accomplish his work. Is it not encouraging to know that despite any limitations we may have, the Almighty wants to use us and will help us to accomplish his work?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 66. Local announcements. Discuss with audience how Topic for Conversation has been received in the territory. Encourage publishers to bring the householder’s family into the conversation. Perhaps, after greeting the person, you might ask: “How are you? How is your family?’’ People usually respond well to such questions and may give you an opportunity to converse with them. Depending on the answer, you could acknowledge how hard it is for parents to provide for their families. You could also point out that God is aware of the situation of man and he has in store better conditions for families here on the earth. You may show how the fulfillment of the promise in Psalm 37 would contribute to happiness in family life. You could call attention to page 188 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font10"> book, and 2 Peter 3:13, 14, tying the text in with the illustration on the following page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Warm discussion of article “Faithfully Pursue ‘The Way.’ ” Have well-prepared questions for audience participation, emphasizing that the important goal is to remain an approved witness of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font10">Teaching at Bible studies by emphasizing the Scriptures so that the student will see that he is studying the Bible. At Bible studies we teach Jehovah’s thoughts. It is important that, when people study the Bible, they understand what they are considering. (Neh. 8:8) There is no one specific way to accomplish this; not all people respond in the same way. Use what seems best to make the Bible understandable to those with whom you study. Highlighting scriptures, however, does not mean that every text in the lesson must be read and discussed. You may wish to develop with the audience some of the following suggestions and/or others that have worked well locally.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(a) During the first few studies, you may wish to look up quoted scriptures. The householder will then be able to compare what he is seeing in his Bible with what he is seeing in the book. Encourage student to incorporate texts in his answers. Example: When a student answers and there is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> scripture that he could have used, you could ask: “How does [text] prove that point?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(b) Ask additional </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">specific</span><span class="font10"> questions. Simply asking, “What did you get out of that scripture?” may not be enough. Often the answer is so general that the real point is missed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Example of better way: On page 12 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font10"> book, the question on paragraph 6 is: “Why were these things written aforetime?” First Corinthians 10:11 is cited. After reading the text you could ask: “Why is it good to read the Bible?” “What statement in the text proves that?” You might ask audience for additional examples.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(c) Rather than just all generalknowledge questions, the review questions could consist largely of the type that require reasoning on the Bible to answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(d) Write on a card or paper the main points being considered in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> particular chapter and the scriptures that support these points. This card or paper can be placed in the Bible and be used when the study is first started; it may be best to use only the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Remind audience that there is no set procedure to follow. Also, that there is no need to read every scripture. The above suggestions have been helnful to some publishers in the field. To conclude, you may want to have paragraph 8 on page 42 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font10"> book read, and have audience apply points (b) and (c). Song 20 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font10">Song 51 and local announcements. An experienced publisher discusses with a new publisher article &quot;God’s Spirit Will Help You.” Handle it not as a review of the material, but as a natural conversation with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> person needing encouragement in field activity. 20 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font10">Teaching at Bible studies by helping the student use information in his daily life. Discuss with audience the following observations of brothers who have been conducting studies for years. Good to allow person to make his own decisions rather than to tell him what he should do. It is not proper to force our beliefs on him. We should avoid an appearance of unduly prying into student’s private life with questions of a very personal nature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(a) It may be that at the end of every study, questions such as these could be asked: “How do you feel about it? Do you think this would help you in your life?” If the student asks a particular question regarding his life, it may be necessary to cover material on that question right away in order to assist him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(b) When it is appropriate, use your own example and the benefits you received from studying the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(c) To stimulate service activity you might want to ask periodically, “Have you discussed anything from the Bible with others?” or, as you study with him you might ask: “How could this scripture help to explain this point to someone else?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(d) Prepare study with student and his needs in mind, and include him in your prayers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">“Take as a pattern . . . the prophets.” The ancient Hebrew prophets were men “with feelings like ours.” (Jas. 5:10, 17) It was not always easy for them to carry out their commission, since they often faced bitter opposition from their own countrymen. At times they were discouraged and had to adjust their thinking. Discuss the following questions with audience: (1) What did Jeremiah face when declaring God’s message to his own people? (Jer. 20: 7, 8) (2) How did the attitude of the Israelites affect the prophet’s view of his assignment? (Jer. 20:9, 10) (3) Was Jeremiah able to continue in his own strength? (Jer. 20:11) (4) Why may we feel at times like Jeremiah, and how can this example encourage us? (5) How did Elijah come to feel about his assignment and why? (1 Ki. 19:4, 9, 10) (6) Was Elijah right in his thinking? (1 Ki. 19:15-18) (7) What does the case of Elijah illustrate as to our knowledge regarding how much work remains to be done and how many honest-hearted persons may yet be found? Song 39 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 37 and local announcements. “Presenting the Good News— With Kindness.” Discussion using local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font10">Handling problems at Bible studies—When the person wishes to stop the study. Good to remember that our concern should be for him as a person and not merely as an individual who should not stop his Bible study. Even as early as your second visit, people may wish to stop studying. Sometimes publishers are unable to continue Bible discussions after the first contact with the householder. A number of factors may be involved. It is best to avoid any implication or trying to “pressure” the student into continuing his study. Use the Bible to reason with the student and encourage him. It may take more than one visit to find him home. Discuss with audience the following observations from brothers in the field.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(a) Discern </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font10"> reason: For some people, “studying the Bible” presents an obligation, a commitment of themselves, their time or privacy. So the householder may not be at home when the publisher returns, or may frankly inform the brother that he does not want to “study.” This was the case with a Chinese man who told the publisher: “I don’t want a Bible study, but I would enjoy some discussions.” Others have felt that they were being indoctrinated because publishers were trying to teach too much, too soon. A good number receive opposition from relatives and friends. If this is the case, avoid being unduly critical or hard on those who have influenced the student to stop studying. Recognize that they believe they are acting in the best interests of the student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(b) On the first study or very soon thereafter prepare student for opposition. One or two scriptures could be considered at the end of each study, forewarning him of possible opposition. It seems best to begin discussing opposition in a general way and then to become more specific.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">(c) Become a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">friend</span><span class="font10"> of your Bible student. Being a friend and not just a cool, functional teacher, will aid him to cope with opposition. If it is learned that he has been sick, call him up to see how he is doing. Similarly, when members of his family (though they may manifest opposition) are not feeling well, stop to see them as a friend and not as a preacher. Encourage student to love the opposers, in harmony with Jesus’ words to “love your neighbor as yourself.” Keep in contact with him as much as possible, and not only at the time set for Bible discussions. Even if the study is temporarily discontinued, the teacher should stay in close contact with the student. Try to leave the door open for further discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">“Strive to Reach Hearts.’’ Talk by an elder. Tie in local field service activity, discussing hours spent and what could be done to reach more people. Song 70 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 64 and announcements. Discuss Branch Letter in harmony with words of Acts 16:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Handling problems at Bible studies- -Lack of preparation on student’s part. Good to recognize that majority of students do not study in advance. Problems and other responsibilities may interfere with preparation. Each student should be handled as an individual. Teaching, not necessarily the method used, is the important factor. Be adaptable in your approach. Do not force the student to follow a standard way if he can be taught better in another way. You may discuss with audience the following observations and/or others that apply locally.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(a) Although it is good to encourage preparation, if student does not prepare his lesson beforehand, it may be unwise to make a big issue of it. Some brothers</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The course before us, therefore, is clear. Our lives should always harmonize with the command of Jesus Christ: “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:36) Yes, maintain fine conduct, continue to love your brothers from the heart, and declare the “good news” so that others can join you in faithfully pursuing “The Way.” Let nothing distract you from the all important goal—remaining in “The Way” as an approved witness for Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you feel that you are in debt to the people living in your territory? The Christian apostle Paul did. He wrote: “Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to senseless ones I am a debtor.” (Rom. 1:14) Yes, the apostle keenly sensed that he was under obligation to declare the “good news” to all whom he could reach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Like the apostle Paul, we today surely want to do all that we can to discharge our debt or obligation toward fellow humans. There should be an “eagerness” on our part to reach the hearts of others with the “good news.” (Rom. 1:15) What does this require?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For one thing, we need to have the right attitude toward unbelievers. Regardless of how unresponsive or unkind they may be, they are still persons for whom Christ died. It is our responsibility to do what we can to make them aware of this important fact. To this end, we should keep in mind the example of the apostle Paul: “To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; ... I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.”—1 Cor. 9:20-22.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In keeping with the apostle’s example, we do well to think about the people in our territory. They may vary as to their outlook on life, their goals and their religious views. It may be helpful to talk with others as to how they approach people of various backgrounds and religious persuasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The publications certainly have played a vital role in reaching people’s hearts. So we want to make good use of the current literature offer. At times, however, the householder’s comments may indicate that he would be benefited more by another publication. When that is the case, it is best to be flexible. Also, while we want to make the literature available to others, we need not feel obligated to offer a publication in each case on the initial call. Sometimes it may be better to make arrangements for a future Bible discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Since the preaching of the “good news” is really Jehovah’s work, we should look to him for direction. It would be most appropriate, therefore, to 'pray that Jehovah might open the hearts of people in the territory and grant us wisdom and insight to be able to make the truth clear to them. May our motivations and actions at all times reveal that we want to be used by Jehovah to aid all in our territory.—Acts 16:14; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">Clearly, there is much work yet to be done in getting the “good news” proclaimed. May all of us seek to do our part as we look to Jehovah for increase. Rest assured of our prayers in your behalf.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">With Kindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>When sharing in the field service, have you ever awakened someone from sleep? How did you handle the situation? Or, if a householder is very busy and cannot listen, what do you do?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Showing kindness in the above and similar circumstances would certainly be in order. We personally appreciate receiving someone at our door who is polite and cheerful, and asks in a sincere way, “How are you?” So if we realize that we have called at an inconvenient time, it would be the kind thing to excuse ourselves for the disturbance, and not to insist on giving a lengthy presentation. Possibly a handbill or magazine could be left and arrangements made to call again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Unexpected opportunities may present themselves to show kindness. Perhaps a woman is having difficulty in carrying heavy shopping bags. Might not an offer to help be appreciated and lead to giving a fine witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jesus Christ set an excellent example for us in showing kindness. On one occasion, after having helped many people spiritually, he said: “I feel pity for the crowd, because it is already three days that they have stayed with me and they have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away fasting.” (Matt. 15:32) Yes, Jesus took into consideration how people </span><span class="font18">God’s Spirit Will Help You (Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">Father so that he can use us to the greatest extent possible? Most certainly! But what can we do? We need to put ourselves in a position that will make it possible for God’s spirit to operate fully in our case. Since the spirit is holy, we need to maintain a holy, pure or clean standing before our heavenly Father. Furthermore, God’s spirit does not grant us miraculous knowledge today, but it functions as a remembrancer and teacher. (John 14:26) So if we will fill our minds with God’s Word, his spirit will recall points from the Scriptures and enable us to apply them correctly. Hence, when discussing the truth with others, we need not be fearful that we will misrepresent the “good news.” As long as we are doing our part and look to Jehovah for aid, his spirit will not fail us.—Compare Matthew 10:18-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> God’s spirit will also help us when there is unfavorable response felt and was alert to respond to their needs.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The value of kindness is well illustrated by the following experience from Canada: “One Saturday afternoon during the circuit overseer’s visit, my husband and I were making our last call in the field service for the day. The lady who lived next door was just locking up her house to go away. We asked her if she would like a ride, as we were going to Andover, and it turned out that this lady was going to Andover also to visit some friends. When we arrived there, we found that her friends were just leaving to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font12"> across the border to a funeral and would not be back that night. As a result this lady was stranded. So we invited her to go to the meeting with us and indicated that after the meeting we would take her home. She enjoyed the meeting so much that she went with us to the public talk the next week and has expressed the desire to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” What a blessed result from an act of kindness!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> While carrying out our vital witnessing in a way that reflects dignity and seriousness, we should not approach people in a cold, businesslike manner. Be friendly. Greet people as the opportunity arises. (Matt. 5:47) Be polite and thoughtful. Your friendliness and kind approach may provide the opening for an extended witness, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">in the territory. As we go about our work prayerfully, the spirit may recall Scriptural thoughts to our minds as to what God’s servants faced in times past and what strengthened them to continue. When we note how unhappy the unresponsive ones are, we come to appreciate even more what a blessing the truth is. God’s spirit will make clear to us just how grand a privilege it is to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Yes, with the help of the holy spirit, we can be successful if we let nothing stop us from obeying Jesus Christ’s command to preach and make disciples.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font10">What is the proper view of commercial activities within the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When we have clearly in mind the purpose of our meetings and association with our brothers, this question is not difficult to answer. We attend meetings and associate with our brothers to be encouraged spiritually. (Heb. 10:23-25) Therefore, it would be Inappropriate to introduce anything, including commercial activities, that would detract from the Scriptural reasons for coming to-gether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some have expressed concern because, in some cases, advertising has been sent to them individually or to the Kingdom Hall by persons requesting that material advertising such things as group travel to other cities or countries be read to the congregation, circulated among the brothers or posted on the information board. In other instances brochures and letters are received concerning chain letters, employment opportunities, secular training programs, merchandise, and so forth, which have nothing to do with the advancement of Kingdom interests. We will avoid raising needless questions in the minds of others if we keep commercial endeavors separate from activity at our meetings for worship.—1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 31-33; Phil. 1:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So it is best not to exploit theocratic associations by either initiating or advertising the sale of any goods or services for commercial advantage in the Kingdom Hall, at congregation book studies and at assemblies of Jehovah’s people. This will aid us to give spiritual interests the full attention they deserve and to keep commercial activity in its proper place.</span></p>

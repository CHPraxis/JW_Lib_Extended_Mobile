<p><span class="font13">When we are busy in Jehovah’s service, time certainly goes by fast, doesn’t it? Here we are at the close of another service year, and what a fine year it has been in many respects, capped off by a grand spiritual feast at the summer district assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We know that you will be interested in some recent developments in preparing for future expansion. Two large, high-speed rotary offset presses have been purchased for the Brooklyn factory. One is being installed this summer and the other will be delivered in October. The presses will improve the quality of printing, especially the pictures. Each has a top capacity of 32,000 impressions per hour, which is three or four times the capacity of one of the four older presses being dismantled to make room for the new ones. For over a year now the new Photoplate Department, with its versatile 32&quot; X 32&quot; precision camera, has contributed toward improved illustrations and a considerable savings in the printing of our literature and magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Towers building is over 80 percent renovated. Working down from the fifteenth or top floor, each floor has been finished progressively and occupied, until now there remain only floors one to three, and the sub-basement, to be completed. Since May we have been making use of the two new dining rooms, accommodating over 950 persons, and a new kitchen on the basement level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By early fall the Society will have in operation a small business computer to handle bookkeeping, invoicing, the making of labels and inventory of literature. This will speed up operations here and give you better service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Also we are happy to pass along to you some encouraging news on expansion from overseas that has come to us. In Colombia, France, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Use New Tract to Start Conversations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The new tract, “The Family— Can It Survive?”, has been especially designed to aid us to start conversations. And conversations on the Bible lead to Bible studies. So, this will be our twin objective in September: To distribute tracts and start conversations leading to Bible studies. And since we will be spending more time with many of those contacted, we will be taking the whole month for distributing the tract.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The family and its survival are matters of concern to all. The pressures and problems of this modern generation affect people of all economic levels, young and old, men and women. So, whoever comes to the door, we have a topic that concerns that person. The important thing is to make your presentation simple but forceful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Let them know that you have brought them a special message about the family. Hand it to them and tell them that it is free. Then state that, while at their home, you want to call their attention to several points in the tract. Open another copy of the tract and refer to some of these points of concern: Divorces have increased so that now the rate is close to one in three marriages. Many couples who stay</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Your Joy in Serving God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Joy is a fruit of God’s holy spirit—therefore, something that we need to have. Jesus, full of God’s spirit, was a man of joy, even though he was “a man meant for pains and for having acquaintance with sickness.” (Isa. 53:3) Nevertheless, “for the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”—Heb. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus looked forward to the service God had reserved for him as King and High Priest. He experienced great joy in teaching and training others who would share with him in that Kingdom. Also he found supreme joy in upholding his Father’s name and in strengthening his disciples to partake of that joy. These joys caused all rebuffs and indignities to pale into insignificance. Imitating Jesus, we will be able to face difficult situations, as well as enjoy the favorable ones, in preaching the good news. Always sustaining us is the joy of anticipating the new system of things and what Jehovah has in store for us, as we appreciate pres-together are having serious problems. Children rebel against their parents and youthful lawbreakers are steadily increasing. To promote conversation and interest, ask them how they feel about these threats to the survival of the family.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIBLE HAS THE ANSWERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Discussing several threats to the family unit will lead naturally to the Bible. Explain to them how the Bible foretold the very conditions we see today. Read selected phrases from 2 Timothy 3:1-5, on page 2 of the tract (or directly from the Bible if the householder has the time): “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, . . . disobedient to parents, . . . having no natural affection.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>0</sup> The Bible not only foretells these conditions that threaten the family, but also shows how families can have a good measure of success and happiness. After making this point, you might turn to page 4 of the tract and call attention to one or more of the questions presented. But, while these serious family problems exist in the community and world wide, we do not </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font13"> 7) ently having a measure of health and strength that we can use in his service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JOYS THAT WE CAN NOW HAVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> One of the outstanding joys we can now have is to help our brothers, as in times of sickness, need, distress, bereavement or loneliness. (Gal. 6:10; Jas. 1:27) And, what can replace the joy we have in sharing the good news with others, especially when we can study the Bible with them? Nothing encourages us more than to see them grasp the truth and begin to change their lives in harmony with the requirements of true worship. We have to experience this joy really to appreciate it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When witnessing we know that we are sharing the best of good news. Why, then, do we sometimes tend to lose our joy? It is because we tend to forget </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font13"> we are proclaiming the good news. When we meet with unpleasant looks or apathy, we need to remind ourselves that none of our work is in vain in connection with the Lord </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

Selected scriptures can be used in showing Scriptural support for adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: &quot;Use New Tract to Start Conversations.&quot; Read and progressively demonstrate suggestions in article: (1) Publisher goes to door; householder busy but accepts brief witness and tract, then Interrupts with &quot;not Interested” before publisher Is able to present </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. (Chairman: No reason to be discouraged. Preaching of good news Is being done. We know some will reject.) (2) Same publisher Introduces tract and discusses points from 2 Timothy 3:1-5. Offers to demonstrate value of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, but householder shows lack of Interest. (3) Publisher now goes to third door; householder listens to presentation, accepts book, and publisher lays groundwork for Bible study by starting to discuss chapter on family when chairman cuts In to summarize what might be expected at various homes. In most Instances, not be able to get beyond placing the tract and perhaps offering the book, but do not be discouraged. They have the tract and you are preaching the good news. But wherever there Is enough interest, follow through and try to start a Bible study. In some cases, might find It best to arrange for return visit to start Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since four issues of the magazines will be arriving in September, we will want to carry them along when we are sharing in the tract distribution. Most of the September issues feature articles about problems affecting family life. When the conversation at the door Indicates that the householder would appreciate something further to read, offer the magazines or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. Keep in mind that our objective Is, not simply to place literature, but to start conversations leading to Bible studies. If each publisher would be able to start </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font12"> study during the month, that would be a very good accomplishment during the tract campaign.

Recognize that in addition to actual widows and fatherless children, there are those whose mates are not in the truth or children with one or both parents not in the truth. They need special encouragement and help also. And where there is a material need, we want to be quick to see how we can be of assistance by sharing what we have.

What can be done to ensure that all tracts will be distributed by end of month? If some need more .tracts or have more than they can put out, arrangements can be made for redistribution. If there is likelihood of some tracts remaining at end of month, perhaps we might shorten presentation somewhat while not cutting down on effectiveness. Outline arrangements for group witnessing for coming week. Including evening witnessing. and encourage all to support. Song 76 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">—that Jehovah will cause it to work out to his vindication and glory. (1 Cor. 15:58) Since he has given us the good news and the commission to proclaim it, we can be sure that our speaking God’s Word of truth will never fail to give glory to him. Many are the experiences of persons who turned down the truth many times but found that they could not forget what they had heard. Eventually they just </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font13"> to take it seriously, and it brought real joy and meaning to their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We can have great joy if we do what God sets before us to do. We will be happy if we do what we can according to our ability. While we can work to improve our God-given abilities and opportunities, we destroy our joy if we worry about our weaknesses and inadequacies. We need to keep constantly in mind that it is not by might and power, nor by the wisdom of man that God gets his work done, but by his spirit. We can receive that spirit, along with the necessary wisdom to cope with our problems, by asking for it in faith.—Luke 11:13; Jas. 1:5.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Arrangements for Congregation Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">As announced at the district assemblies, there will be some new arrangements in the congregation organization. All elders should carefully read this information which is based on talks given at the assemblies and follow through accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECRETARIES TO BENEFIT THE FLOCK OF GOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In these modern times when the Kingdom work is well established with more than forty thousand congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world, it is necessary to have certain records for the benefit of the congregation. This is in keeping with the Bible principle stated at 1 Corinthians 14:40: “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.’’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2 Therefore each congregation will benefit by having an appointed Secretary to take responsibility for handling the communications and Important records of the congregation. During the coming six months (when the circuit overseer visits) the body of elders in each congregation will recommend one of the elders to be appointed as Secretary of the congregation. He should be a brother who has the abilities to properly care for the records and files of the congregation and who is able to write communications well. Some brothers are better qualified for such work than others. (1 Cor. 12:28-30) Hence the elders should carefully examine the qualifications of the brother to be recommended, taking into consideration the duties that must be performed and his willing spirit of wanting to serve his brothers. In some congregations there may be several who are well qualified. Since only one can be assigned to this service the elders will have to select just one to recommend. They will also have in mind that when the Secretary has been appointed, he will not rotate out of this secretary assignment but will serve continuously from year to year until such time as the body of elders may see fit to recommend a chafige. —See 2 Kings 12:10, 11 and 22:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">a The Secretary should be recommended by the local body of elders during the first visit of the circuit overseer after September 1. Such recommendation will be made when the usual recommendations on appointments of elders and ministerial servants are sent in. The word “Secretary” must be written in the margin of the recommendation form (S-2) before the name of the individual, under elder recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* The full name and address of the Secretary should be Included with the recommendation on the S-29 form. Circuit overseers have a supply of this form. The Secretary’s address will become the permanent mailing address for the congregation. All of the correspondence for the congregation from the Governing Body or the Society will be directed to that address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">s The brother who is appointed as Secretary for the congregation ought to be regular in attendance at the meetings and make the congregation records available to the other elders for the benefit of the congregation. If at some time he knows he will have to be absent from the area for any reason, then he should make arrangements for another brother temporarily to take care of his duties and check to see about any mall or communications coming to his address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">°The Secretary will be required to maintain vital records of the congregation in an orderly way, including the appointments of elders and ministerial servants, all letters from the Society to the elders and the congregation, copies of the reports of the traveling overseers, orders and remittances to the Society, records concerning ownership of the Kingdom Hall or other congregation properties, information about any Kingdom Hall loans, insurance, deeds and other documents. There are also records on disfellowshiping cases handled by judicial committees that should be kept in the congregation files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot; The Secretary should be a punctual person who will keep track of dates when the congregation’s needs have to be cared for. If the congregation has formed a legal corporation in order to carry on its service to Jehovah, the Secretary should know what the government requires in the way of reports to government offices, annual meetings, keeping of minutes of meetings, and the posting of any required announcements concerning the corporation. He should keep the files of the corporation and see that the one responsible for preparing the minutes has them in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">s If the congregation owns a Kingdom Hall or other property, the Secretary should be sure that local government requirements are met to insure receiving any exemption from taxes that may be available locally. If any legal notices are received he will follow through to see that these are brought to the attention of the body of elders and are given prompt attention by the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">«The Secretary will be interested in coordinating the business activities of the congregation, such as the prompt payment of utility bills, insurance when it is due, payments on any loans, paying any taxes due, sending in orders for Memorial invitations well in advance, and getting reports sent off on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> He will send in communications to the offices of the Society, including orders and remittance forms which are prepared by other brothers serving in the congregation. It will be his responsibility to check these to see that they are legible and figures are accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">it Whenever letters to all of the elders are received from the Society he will circulate these to all of the elders, having each elder put his initials on the letter to show that he has read it. He will keep track of such letters and get them back after all elders have read and handled them and put them in the congregation files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> The Secretary will keep the publisher’s record cards and compile the field service reports for the congregation. In some coifgregations the body of elders may wish to assign an elder (if available) or a capable ministerial</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, SEPTEMBER 1977 </span><span class="font13">servant to assist the Secretary in caring for some of the records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">is It is not expected that these duties will take up all of the time of the Secretary, but those who are appointed as secretaries will be able to share in conducting congregation book studies and will take the lead in field service in connection with those study groups, and serve as any other elder with the congregation, handling meeting parts, as a member of a judicial committee, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">i« In large congregations where there are a good number of elders appointed, the recommendation may mean that one who now serves in a capacity where he is very busy, such as Bible study overseer or field overseer, may be recommended as Secretary. If that be the case, then the body of elders may wish to arrange for another elder to take over such service when the Secretary is appointed for his new work. In small congregations the Secretary may be able to serve in other offices too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">is it is our firm belief that the appointment of a Secretary for each congregation will fill a need that now exists in the congregations and will result in added benefits as the body of overseers pays attention to all those in the flock of God.—Acts 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THEY WILL ALL BE TAUGHT BY JEHOVAH&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">i« Christians in these last days continue to be persons “taught by Jehovah.” (Isa. 54:13) They also appreciate the provision of having “gifts In men” who, among other things, have the responsibility to teach. (Eph. 4:11-13) On this point the disciple James wrote: “Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.” (Jas. 3:1) Hence, elders constantly seek to improve in their teaching. Some are effective on the Individual level or In giving talks. Others are good teachers in the field and in aiding new ones. There are elders who are particularly successful in aiding others to advance spiritually by conducting Instructive </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> studies or Theocratic Schools. Abilities vary but whatever gift one has, he is encouraged to use it to benefit others.—1 Pet. 4:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it</span><span class="font13"> As we learned at this year’s district assemblies some adjustments have been made that will affect the oversight of two congregation meetings. After the annual rotation takes place in September 1977 two of the five positions of elder service will not be subject to rotation thereafter. These will be (1) the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study conductor and (2) the Theocratic School overseer. The body of elders should consider who among them would serve particularly well in these two positions. The elders who rotate into these positions in September will serve temporarily until the circuit overseer next visits the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">lain making their final selections the body of elders may be helped by the suggestions of the circuit overseer during his next visit. It is understood that the actual assignments to these two positions will be made by the bodies of elders and not the circuit overseer. No appointment letters from the Society’s branch office will be needed in these cases. However, so that there will be some record to which the branch office may refer, the circuit overseer will make an appropriate notation on the back of the recommendation form (S-2). Along the left side of the names in the list of all appointed elders in the congregation, he will indicate which elder has been assigned to care for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study and which elder will look after the Theocratic School. He will use the abbreviations “WSC” and “TSO” respectively. In this way both the branch office and the local congregation will have a record of who have been assigned to serve continuously in these two positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> In addition to assigning the elders who will oversee each of these two positions, the body of elders, along with the circuit overseer, will designate other elders who do particularly well in teaching at these two meetings, to assist the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study conductor and Theocratic School overseer. Depending on local circumstances, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study conductor would welcome other elders to assist him in conducting the weekly </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">studies for periods of a month at a time. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">study conductor would be responsible to schedule such additional elders for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study. The same would be true of the Theocratic School overseer, who will be glad for the help the additional elders can give in conducting one or more schools of the congregation, usually for two-month periods. The Theocratic School overseer would be responsible for the scheduling of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 As indicated earlier, these two elders would be left In their teaching positions for an indefinite period of time. If at some future time the body of elders, along with the visiting circuit overseer should find it advisable, changes could be made. This Improved teaching arrangement will enable brothers to serve as they are best fitted. In congregations where there are few elders it will be necessary to adapt as best they can by using the one or two men selected, even though the chairmanship will be kept rotating annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">si CIRCUIT OVERSEER’S VISIT: The traveling overseers of Jehovah’s people have long been serving congregations as appointed teachers. They meet the Biblical qualifications to teach In the congregation. They contribute much on their visits toward the sustained enlightenment of the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> Up until now, congregation meetings have been held on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font13"> days of his visit, plus a meeting with the elders and ministerial servants, a meeting with the elders, and the meeting with the pioneers. Such a schedule has been a full one for the congregation members as well as for the circuit overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> Beginning in September 1977, an adjusted week’s program will go into effect. Congregation meetings will be held on only </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font13"> days during the visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup>It is recommended that the Theocratic School and the service meeting be held on Tuesday of his visit. The regular Theocratic School and a 30-minute service meeting will be followed by the circuit overseer's closing service talk, for a total session of two hours, including the songs and prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>25</sup> The whole congregation will meet again at the Kingdom Hall, preferably on a regular meeting night, perhaps Thursday or Friday: the body of elders will choose one of their number to conduct one lar ge book study for that night. The book study will be reduced to 45 minutes, but the effort should still be made to cover the assigned portion for that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>26</sup> Following the book study, the circuit overseer will present an audience-participation feature to be called “Continue in the Things That You Learned.&quot; (2 Tim. 3: 14) This may include information on any points that the circuit overseer feels would be helpful to the congregation. He may consider it appropriate to cover material not only from recent </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font13"> but also from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font13"> book. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font13"> and other publications. This 30-minute part will be followed by a concluding service talk by the circuit overseer. All together, this midweek meeting would last for one hour and 45 minutes, including the songs and prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">sr The Sunday schedule for the visit will also be adjusted to two hours, including the songs and prayers. The circuit overseer will present a public talk for 55 minutes. The change comes in the form and length of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study, which will be conducted without reading the paragraphs. Thirty minutes will be devoted to having the audience participate in answering the questions. This will be followed by the circuit overseer’s concluding talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> it is believed that this adjusted week's schedule will present a more balanced program for the week. It will eliminate an additional evening meeting which time the brothers can use for other activity. Plans should be made for increased efforts in field service during this special week. In this way all in the congregation will be sharing in shining as a collective light in their community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL: Elders have expressed great appreciation for the training provided at the Kingdom Ministry School. In fact, many of them have asked whether they could have another opportunity to attend and keep up to date. With the organizational adjustments that have been made over the years it seems advisable for all elders to be given additional training. When several elders go through the school at the same time the congregation seems to reap the greater benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">so For these reasons the course has been revised and tailored to meet the cun-ent needs of the Christian congregations. Revised textbook material has been prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">si Arrangements have been made for all elders to attend the Kingdom Ministry School this autumn in their respective circuits. We feel confident this provision will be a source of great encouragement and spiritual refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ADMINISTERING GOD’S LAW IN THE CONGREGATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">32 The arrangement for administering God’s law in the Christian congregation today is similar to what existed in the first century of our Common Era among early Christians. Working In conjunction with the “faithful and discreet slave,” there is a central or governing body of older men that has a special responsibility in directing the administration of Bible laws among Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. Congregational elders and also traveling overseers are empowered to act as judges on behalf of the congregation. These administrators are appreciated as a loving provision of Jehovah and are viewed with respect because of their work. (1 Thess. 5:12, 13; 1 Tim. 5:17) In order to educate others and uphold God’s requirements these men need to be well acquainted with Bible laws. They realize that judging is not just a matter of hearing cases. Administering God’s law on their part involves observing and teaching it, urging obedience to it as well as using it as a basis for judgment when acting in a judicial capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">33 There is a need today for qualified counselors as well as judges. (Isa. 1:26) In most situations in life where problems arise, counselors are truly appreciated when they help to resolve questions or problems brought to their attention. Hence, If someone commits a wrong &quot;before he is aware of it,” loving help can usually be given by two or more of the elders. This is done in the &quot;spirit of mildness” as they counsel and readjust the erring one. (Gal. 6:1, 2) Where elders observe an Individual starting on a course that is in direct conflict with divine law, they should make a diligent effort to help him, giving repeated admonition as necessary. (Titus 3:10, 11) Being merciful, they may succeed in ‘snatching him out of the fire,’ sparing such one from severe judgment. (Jude 23) Flagrant cases require elders to ‘reprove with severity’ in order to restore a healthy faith. To benefit properly from congregational shepherds all serious cases should be brought to their attention, so that they can apply the laws of God according to need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">34 In the present arrangement the presiding overseer, field overseer, and Bible study overseer have served as a judicial committee. But these brothers already have many responsibilities. Furthermore, experience and time are needed in handling judicial matters and in dealing with serious cases of wrongdoing, which often become involved and require careful deliberation, discussion and the giving of Scriptural counsel and reproof, or the taking of dis-fellowshlplng action where repentance Is lacking. Sometimes more than one case is pending and in need of urgent attention. If certain cases are put off or prolonged unnecessarily, some may become disturbed and feel that nothing is being done or that the protection of the congregation is being neglected. While all elders who serve in the congregation have a sense of responsibility, the facts show that those who have been automatically taking on judicial committee functions have not always been prepared or experienced to the extent that the careful administration of God’s law within the congregation requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">35 When serious matters requiring judicial action are brought to the attention of elders, from now on how will the process of selecting a judicial committee be initiated? In some cases, Individuals guilty of serious wrongdoing, or those who definitely know of such wrongdoing, may approach any elder they feel they wish to talk to. He, in turn, may ask the chairman to call a meeting of the elders. In the absence of the chairman the matter would be brought to one designated by him to serve temporarily and he would preside at such a meeting. The elder first hearing of the problem would relate </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">briefly</span><span class="font13"> the nature of the case to the entire body of elders present. This does not mean going into unnecessary details but simply stating the name of the person or persons involved and what the problem is, whether immorality, fraud, drunkenness, drug abuse, or some other serious wrong. The body of elders would give thought as to whether the problem involves a single or married person, youthfulness or some other characteristic that might enable them to make an appropriate selection of elders. For example, if the matter involves a controversy that includes a charge of fraud, they may want to select experienced elders whose background makes them more suitable to serve as a judicial committee to investigate such a charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">so What is considered at this initial meeting should not be discussed with those not entitled to know. Elders have the responsibility to keep things in confidence. Problems can be caused by indiscreet talk or a breach of confidence on the part of any one of the elders or members of the judicial committee. Proverbs 25:9 says: “Plead your own cause with your fellowman, and do not reveal the confidential talk of another.’’ The wisdom of those words should be closely observed. If there is a breach of confidence, elders should realize that this may raise questions regarding their soundness of judgment and depth of love for others who may be Involved.—Prov. 10:19; 11:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">sr There may be times when more than one case of a serious nature arises. It may be necessary to select two judicial committees to care for the different cases, provided there are sufficient qualified elders. If not, then whatever is most suitable to meet the needs of the situation would be for them to work out. Where there are less than three elders in a congregation, then qualified elders from a nearby congregation may be invited to serve, if such are available. If a congregation is in an isolated area and it is not convenient to have elders from a distant place sit with the local judicial committee members, then a well-qualified ministerial servant may be selected to complete the judicial committee. Or, if a visit from the traveling overseer is approaching within a week or two,. the local elders may decide to await his visit and he can be asked to serve with them. Where it is not possible for more than two elders to be present, then just the two could handle the matter. (Matt. 18:19) If they disagree on what action to take in the matter, each can submit his report to the Society’s branch office. If none of these alternatives is possible in very isolated regions, the local elder, or the responsible one serving as substitute overseer, may write to the Society’s branch office for direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ss A judicial committee need not be limited to three members. The Scriptures do not give any specific number of older men who handled cases of wrongdoing in the early Christian congregation. Older men who served in the community during Israel’s history may have heard cases according to their availability at the city gate. For example, Boaz selected ten of the older men of the city to hear the matter he had to present. (Ruth 4:1, 2) However, everyone in the community was under the Law covenant arrangement then, and this added to the number for whom the older men were responsible. Within each congregation today, the number would not be that great in most cases, so three would usually be sufficient to have on a judicial committee. Where the gravity of what is involved warrants having four or even five experienced men to serve, this may be arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">39 There would be no need for the one having a problem to be overly concerned about who the individual elders are with whom he will be meeting. In submitting to those shepherding them, Christians can be confident that the undershepherds desire the best for the flock. (Heb. 13:17) They should respect the judgment of those who are appointed to act in administering God’s righteous principles and pointing out what His Word says, just as this was expected in Israel of old. (Deut. 17:10-13) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font13"> the wrongdoer or one accused is known to have strong feelings toward one of their number, the body of elders would have this in mind and exercise good judgment when making their selection. By acting out of consideration for all concerned, the fullest cooperation will be gained from them at the hearing itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;0 There may be rare occasions when one or more of those involved claim that a judicial committee member is partial. If this happens prior to the actual proceedings, the body of elders will consider whether there is any substance to such claim. Proverbs 24:23 says: &quot;The showing of partiality in judgment is not good.&quot; Therefore, it is left to the local body of elders to decide whether a change in the makeup of the committee would be necessary. Elders related to an accused one or who have been in business together or who have had a special friendship would not normally serve on the judicial committee where there are other qualified brothers available. Each one should conscientiously feel that he can serve without partiality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">4i It should be clear that no “rotation arrangement’’ is involved in selecting such committees. In view of the fact that there are many newly appointed elders who have not had any previous experience in handling judicial matters, the body of elders may Invite one of them to serve with a committee in handling matters that are not unduly complicated. In this way, inexperienced elders will have an opportunity to learn while sitting in as a judicial committee handles an actual case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">42 Once a judicial committee begins to handle a case, there are other factors to be kept in mind. Rather than only looking for rigid rules to govern how a situation should be handled, there is a need to determine whether a basic law of God has truly been violated. Bible principles, the circumstances involved, as well as the gravity of the sin committed, are factors that must all be weighed. And what about the attitude of the individual? This, too, is important. By approaching matters in this way and being thorough, judicial committees will avoid being hasty in reproving or dlsfellowshiping persons where there are insufficient grounds for such actions. (Prov. 25:8) Conversely, they will not be too lenient In dealing with individuals who have not really manifested genuine repentance. We remember how Paul encouraged the Corinthian Christians to receive back into their midst a dlsfellowshiped man who had repented. Yet, in the same second letter he referred to others who continued unrepentant over their wrongdoing.—2 Cor. 12:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">43 Having truly spiritual men to serve in an Impartial judicial capacity within the congregation is a loving provision for our good. Obedience to God’s law and respect for those administering it bring many benefits. Not only are we helped to understand and apply the Bible’s righteous principles, which in itself safeguards and keeps us clean, but the administration of God's law also serves to discipline, straighten out and restore us whenever such becomes necessary. We are thus able to maintain an approved standing with Jehovah, which is essential to life in his coming new order.—Ps. 19:7-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Service Meetings Interesting</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Are the service meetings in your congregation interesting and instructive? If your answer is something less than a vigorous, Yes, there are definite things that all can do to improve them. None of us want to be like the youth who complained that life at home was boring and yet did nothing about it himself. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Youth</span><span class="font13"> book, pp. 67-70) But what can we individually do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Much depends on what is done before we arrive at the meeting, whether we are to speak from the platform or not. If we read over in advance the outline of the week’s meeting in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font13">and the articles to be considered, we will get much more from the instruction given. If there is a part calling for audience participation, then we should view this as a personal assignment to share in the meeting. By looking up the cited scriptures and thinking about their meaning, we will be ready to apply them in making “public declaration” of our hope.—Heb. 10:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What can you do if you are asked to share in a part on the platform? (And this really applies to almost everyone—sisters, young folks, families—doesn’t it?) First, have in mind that there is nothing comparable to effective preparation and rehearsal. Be thinking about the part well in advance. What is the purpose of this part on the meeting? Analyze how the instruction can best be presented, following the guidelines given in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> If a part calls for “questions and answers,” be a good teacher as chairman and prepare well-thought-out questions. If you do all the talking, then you may find that you minimize your teaching. Have a very brief introduction and conclusion for these parts. Do not get bogged down so that some of the key points have to be skimmed over or skipped because you are running out of time. Where there the Originator of marriage and family life to get the best advice. This will lead right into paragraph 2. Conclude your brief study by referring to the subheadings in the chapter and suggest reading the rest of it very soon. Offer the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font13">book and ask if it would be convenient to stop by the following week to continue the discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Realistically, we will not expect to go as far as presenting a Bible study at every door. But try to get the tract into every home, if possible. And as you do this with is ample material in the article, make these points clear rather than bringing in much outside material. If you keep the discussion moving, this helps to keep it alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Instruction should be practical. Adapt the material to your congregation’s territory. How can the presentations be effectively adapted to responses and objections actually encountered at the doors? It may be good to ask experienced publishers how they would present the offer. Discuss different approaches, explaining why some work, while others are less effective. Obviously, demonstrations must be realistic to be effective. (Have you seen some and said, “But it just doesn’t happen that way in the field”?) Demonstrations should instruct, not entertain. They should be rehearsed well, proper instructions also being given on the use of microphones. And don’t forget the importance of staying within your allotted time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> To arouse anticipation, a brief preview of the upcoming service meeting and the publications that will be used can be given at the close of the book study. Comments on how to prepare for service meetings may also be worked into shepherding calls by the elders.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> During the service meeting keep in mind that its purpose is to build us up spiritually and equip us for the field service. As each part is presented, ask yourself: “How does the material help me to prove to myself ‘the good and acceptable and perfect will of God’?” (Rom. 12:2) &quot;How can I use the suggestions to increase my effectiveness in the preaching work?” Field points such as attention-getting introductions and transitions may be jotted down in our service Bibles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As all of us ‘brace up </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out </span><span class="font13">minds for activity,’ may we do our part to make service meetings interesting, while we also benefit from them fully.—1 Pet. 1:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">enthusiasm and real concern for your neighbors, likely there will be many opportunities to engage people in conversation and occasionally to place the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book in order to lay the groundwork for a Bible study. Evening witnessing and auxiliary pioneering may open up additional opportunities for many to engage more fully in the tract distribution in September. Keep in mind the twin goal: Distributing tracts and starting conversations with a view to having Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (Col. 4:6) This requires the use of discernment and tact while witnessing to our neighbors, that we “might by all means save some.” —1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How can we do this effectively when most people we meet at the doors are strangers? Well, first of all, we already know much about the attitudes, fears and concerns of people in our neighborhood—the high cost of living, crime, unhappy marriages, problems in raising children, racial tensions and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> For example, in October we will be offering the special </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> that features a series of articles on the theme: “Racial Differences—How Great Are They?” While using this issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> how can you effectively discuss this controversial subject? First, you might give some thought to the general attitude of the people in the neighborhood in which you will be working. Are racial feelings strong or extreme? Or, are most people rather moderate and tolerant? Will you be talking mainly to those of your own race or those of another? And remember that our purpose in discussing the subject of racial differences is not only to set the record straight on how God views people of different races but primarily to establish an opening for preaching the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">Schedule for congregation book studies in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font13"> book: September 4: Pages 104 to 110<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> September 11: Pages 110 to 116<sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> September 18: Pages 116 to 120 September 25: Pages 121 to 127<sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> show conditions that would mark the last days, you might ask if they feel that those attitudes are responsible to a great degree for the racial problems that exist in many parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Even in an area where racial feelings run high, you can tactfully ask, “While each of us has his own opinion on the issue of race, wouldn’t it be nice if people of all races could live without displays of racial hatred and violence?” If the householder is of your own race, you might ask: “Do you believe that the bitter feelings that sometimes exist between our race and other races will ever be eliminated?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>0</sup> If you detect that the person has a moderate view of racial differences, you might ask: “While racial prejudice is strong in some parts of the country, have you ever considered God’s viewpoint toward the different races, as found at Acts 10:34, 35?” Or you may wish to refer to Revelation 7:9, where John records a vision from God, of people “out of all nations and tribes and . . . tongues” praising God for their having been delivered into his new system of things.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> In certain areas you may be able to say: “In discussing racial differences some people have said certain races are more intelligent than others. Whatever your view might be, I’m sure you would appreciate reading what this issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> has to say on the subject.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> In many instances you will be able not only to offer the special issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> but also to invite the householder to subscribe. Briefly tell him how he will benefit from the variety of articles featured in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> in the 24 issues of each year. The three booklets you place with the subscription will afford an excellent opportunity to return and start a Bible study. •</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> By thus using discernment and tact in the field service, we can be confident that Jehovah will help us to “impart what is favorable to the hearers.”—Eph. 4:29.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>A Note to Elders</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12">U<sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> At the elders’ meeting early In September arrange to rotate the assignments of oversight. The elders will decide who will serve temporarily as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study conductor ana as school overseer. (The designation of brothers to 1111 these positions on a permanent basis will be made during the next circuit overseer’s visit.) After new assignments have been made, the elder who served previously In a position should arrange to spend time with the newly assigned brother to train him and to acquaint him with his new responsibilities. Additionally, each one should study the details of his assignment as they are set out In the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The present mailing address on file with the Society should be used until the congregation's secretary is selected during the next visit of your circuit overseer. He has forms to be used in advising the Society of the new mailing address, where there Is a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The tract work should be well organized before September 1 by the one who has been field overseer during the service year now ending. He should work closely with the new field overseer (after he is designated) In following through on the tract work. Many congregations have found It effective to assign sections of territory to the book study groups, with the study conductors organizing their groups for covering their respective sections with tracts in cooperation with the field overseer. The study conductors can keep him up to date on how the tract work is progressing. Adjustments can then be made during the month to cover the congregation's territory as thoroughly as possible.</span></p>

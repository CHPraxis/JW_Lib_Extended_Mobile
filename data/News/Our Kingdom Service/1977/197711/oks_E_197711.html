<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 1977</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 20, No. 11 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font13"> landmark month of activity! That is how we will no doubt look back upon November in the days ahead. Each one of us will find the activities of this month both stimulating and rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many of us will be busy contacting our personal doctor and lawyer and other acquaintances in the medical field with the new </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font13"> booklet. Each congregation will be distributing the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Blood</span><span class="font13"> booklet to those of the medical and legal fields in its territory. What a telling effect this campaign is bound to have, and how pleased we </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">p-</span><span class="font13"> 'a to have a share in it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Also during this busy month of November most congregation elders in the United States will have opportunity to attend the newly revised Kingdom Ministry School course. Most of these classes will be held between October 31 and November 20; in circuits where assemblies are being held or where there are more elders than can be accommodated during that period, classes may extend an additional three weeks, to December 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Circuit and district overseers were scheduled to complete the new two-day Kingdom Ministry School course the week of October 4-8. Then the next week, in two-day classes, brothers attended who will be conducting Kingdom Ministry School classes during the period from October 31 to December 11. A number of brothers from Bethel, together with Kingdom Ministry School instructors, served as teachers for the October 4-8 and 11-15 classes. Among the more than 50,000 scheduled to take the course are elders who are also members of the Bethel family. As Paul encouraged, we are being “fitly united in the same mind </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. J)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9">Be Joyful Workers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Today we have every reason to be joyful workers. Our God Jehovah is a “happy God,” and Jesus, his co-worker, is joyful, as he is called “the happy and only Potentate.” (1 Tim. 1:11; 6:14, 15) K we are following in the footsteps of Jesus as his disciples, then we share his joy. Appropriately the apostle Paul wrote: ^'Always rejoice in the Lord. Once more I will say, Rejoice!”—Phil. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIND JOY IN WITNESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In order to carry out Jesus’ command at Acts 1:8 to be witnesses, we continue to show love to people. Jesus pointed out the need for us to love Jehovah foremost, but secondly, to love also our neighbor.—Matt. 22:37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If we truly love our neighbors and find joy in assisting them, this joy will show in our speech. Our presentation of the truth will not be cut-and-dried, so to speak, reflecting an attitude of ‘Here I am because I </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font13"> to be here, not because I </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font13"> to be here.’ Nor will our presentation be repeated word for word from memory without any regard for the intelligence, feelings and sensibilities of the householder. Rather, we should show genuine interest in and love for those to whom we speak, truly seeking to help them to learn the truth of God’s Word. Such unself</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Help &quot;These Little Ones&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus loved people. He was concerned not only about those who faithfully followed him, but also about ones who might stray from the fold. Recall his words at Matthew 18:14: “It is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There is no doubt that Jesus had in mind some who might stray from the flock, for at Matthew 18:12, 13, he said that there would be great rejoicing over one sheep that had strayed and was found and returned to the fold. Yes, Jesus was concerned about “these little ones.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> From time to time some may leave and show no desire at the moment to accept our assistance with a view to their returning. But most who weaken or discontinue Christian activity have done so because of various pressures and personal problems. They have simply left off sharing in the field ish interest in others reflected in our presentation of Bible truths will assist us to gain much joy from witnessing about the Kingdom good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIND JOY IN DISCIPLE-MAKING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We know that Jehovah and the angels rejoice when a disciple is made. We, too, will find joy in disciple-making if we reflect Je-hovan’s love and concern for people. We must be sincerely concerned about potential disciples, not just as “studies” to be reported, but as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">persons.</span><span class="font13"> Truly we will find that joy in conducting studies and making disciples results </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font13"> from a genuine </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font13"> of people than from our attention to certain methods or techniques. People usually respond to a genuine expression of love and interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Jesus set us a fine example. He became the friend of those whom he taught. (John 15:11-15) We, too, can and should endeavor to become the friends of those whom we teach at home Bible studies. With this objective in view our studies should not be cold, systematic reviews or discussions. Rather, they should be warm, helpful, with good teaching and with the emphasis on developing a good relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">service and regularly associating with us at meetings. Having a Christ-like love for these ones, what can we do to help them return?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO CAN HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Each body of elders will want to discuss together, possibly in their December elders’ meeting, how they can help those who have become inactive during the past few years. (Prov. 27:23) As part of their shepherding work, elders should make a special effort to call on these ones who have allowed themselves to “stray” and endeavor to assist them spiritually. Ministerial servants who are acquainted with the thinking and circumstances of inactive ones may be asked to accompany an elder when calling on them to offer encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO DO</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>0</sup> When calling on inactive ones, never scold or chastise them. Rath-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">What view did Paul take of assisting and counseling his brothers? (2 Cor. 4:1, 15, 17; Phil. 3:1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How did Paul evaluate joy in God's service with material interests? (Phil. 3:7, 8)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">What are some hardships we may face today in God’s service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(Consider local Held problems or personal problems some may face.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">(3) What will aid us to find joy in God’s service despite hardships? (Consider following Scriptural points.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Since joy is a fruit of God’s spirit, how can we get it? (Gal. 5:22; Luke 11:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How does doing things for other people help us to find joy today? (Acts 20:35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When undergoing persecution, what attitude will enable us to have joy? (Matt. 5:11, 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What will help us to continue to have joy In God’s service in future days? (Rom. 12:12; 14:17; Heb. 12:2)</span></p>

We want you to know that, even though our busy schedule docs not permit us to answer all your letters, we nevertheless appreciate your interest and prayers in our behalf. We join you In expressing appreciation to Jehovah for the way he is feeding and leading his people In these momentous last days.

<p><span class="font13">We should seek always to help those with whom we study, not being satisfied with teaching Bible principles and commands, but also showing </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">how to apply</span><span class="font13"> these principles in life and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">how to carry out </span><span class="font13">God’s righteous commands. Our discussions should reflect a genuine </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font13"> interest in the student as a potential disciple and therefore a potential brother or sister in the <sup>faith</sup>' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, U.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Truly there is much joy derived*<sup>-</sup>from seeing a disciple make progress to the point of dedication and baptism. Paul experienced such joy and he felt a special attachment to those whom he assisted. (1 Thess. 2:17-20) Even after baptism many still need help. Certainly we derive joy from helping someone become firmly rooted and solid in the faith. (Eph. 3:17-19) Show personal interest in newly baptized disciples. Why not continue assisting them until they have studied at least two books, in order to help them to become solid in the faith?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Certainly our love for Jehovah and for our neighbor will aid us to get the right attitude about helping others. Love and joy are closely connected and are two fruits of God’s holy spirit. (Gal. 5:22) Continue to express your love and interest in people as you carry on your witnessing, teaching and disciple-making activity, and surely you will have much joy as a blessing from our happy and joyful God, Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During 1978 the following will be the arrangement when conducting the Theocratic School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> [w], </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> [&lt;71, Bible </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font13"> [td], and the books </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font13"> [ad] and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life Does Have a Purpose</span><span class="font13"> [Zp] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then will proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 5 minutes. The school overseer will present highlights and questions based on the week's Bible reading assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">INSTRUCTION TALK: No. 1: 15 minutes. This should not be just a summary of the assigned material. It should be a well-developed talk on a chosen theme, assigned to an elder if possible, or, when necessary, to a qualified ministerial servant. The coverage should not be superficial but should provide a presentation that is truly informative and helpful to the congregation. There will be no oral review, so after the instruction talk the students will be dismissed to their various classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 2: 6 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material by a brother. The reading assignments are short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at Intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, application of principles and expressions of appreciation for the wisdom reflected In the text may be included. The talk should be planned in a way that allows for all the assigned verses actually to be read. The allotted time should be fully utilized. The material may be presented as a talk to the congregation, or a boy may read it to his father or to another qualified older brother seated on the platform. The father or other older brother may then use questions to draw from the boy comments on the value of the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 3: 6 minutes. Rather than a talk, this will be a Bible study, conducted by a sister. The one conducting the study should strive to make It as helpful and realistic as possible, so as to benefit from this practical training in conducting a Bible study. It Is not necessary to read the paragraphs, though certain ones might be read. Nor is it necessary to cover all the assigned material; at times certain choice paragraphs could be selected, questions raised and scriptures looked up and considered. If an answer Is incomplete, the student should ask auxiliary questions to draw out the answer. Where the student fails to do this, the school overseer will draw attention to this after the presentation. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 4: 6 minutes. This talk also will be assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, in the congregation or elsewhere. The sister giving the talk may either Initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant (s) do so. Not the setting, but the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 5: 6 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience, it should be a talk to the entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">speaker, when he thinks it fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material especially lends itself to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">REMARKS: After Talks Nos. 2 through 5. the school overseer will have two minutes respectively to highlight truths and principles that the students may not have included in their presentations. These remarks should be meaningful, emphasizing points that will be helpful to the brothers in their homelife, at school, on the job, within the congregation or while out in field service. Occasionally, questions can be put to the audience on points In the assigned material that can be applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">COUNSEL: This will always be given privately after the meeting. More than two minutes may be used as advisable. The private counsel for Talk No. 3 may Include overall impressions as to how the study was conducted. On the Speech Counsel slip use only those aspects that would suitably apply to one conducting a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes It possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points in mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the remarks. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If the school overseer assigns someone to give the &quot;stop signal,&quot; that one should be advised as to the importance of doing this whenever a talk goes overtime. An instruction talk speaker who goes overtime should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully so that the Theocratic School as a whole does not run overtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">ad</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ip</span><span class="font13"> and complete the assignment of personal Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this thirty-minute review. The balance of the hour will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper and, in reading off the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, stressing the matter of accurate knowledge and letting the audience turn to the textbooks where the answers may be checked. If. for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary. the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of fifty or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where It seems advisable, sisters may take any student talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talk No. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ABSENTEES: The brothers and sisters will show appreciation for this school by being present, when possible, at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Help &quot;These Little Ones&quot; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Conl’d) </span><span class="font13">er, show deep love and concern. Let them know that we miss having them with us at meetings. Offer to attend with them, picking them up if that would be helpful. In time, without putting individuals ‘on the spot,’ or making them feel uncomfortable, kindly endeavor to find out why they have drifted away. Is it that they are experiencing some of the pains that come with trying to accumulate unnecessary material things? (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) Have they been stumbled over something that can be straightened out? Let them talk so you will know how you can be of help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> If they do not respond on the first call, do not be discouraged. In some cases it would be good to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness to Someone Each Day</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus did it. The apostles did it. And we can do it today. Do what? Take advantage of all opportunities to share the truth with others through informal witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We should be ready at all times to give a witness to all those we contact as we carry on the everyday affairs of living, just as Jesus witnessed to those he happened to meet, such as the Samaritan woman at the well. Paul witnessed to people with whom he came in contact while imprisoned in Rome. —John 4:6-15; Acts 28:16, 30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Just think of the grand additional witness that would result if each one of us would informally discuss Bible truth each day with even one person. Here in the United States our ratio is one publisher to every 391 persons. Thus, if each one of us witnessed informally to a different person each day, it would mean—in a year’s time—speaking to about as many people as there are in the United States!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN AND WHERE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Often those to whom we informally witness are not otherwise contacted in our visiting the public in their homes. For example, one brother recently traveling by airplane took advantage of the opportunity to talk with the passenger alongside him. He was a businessman who had heard of Jehovah’s Witnesses through the news media, but never personally had talked with one of us. Following a fine two-hour discussion with this man, he gave our brother his home address and private phone number, call again within </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font13"> week or two. Sometimes several calls are needed. Be willing to encourage them Scrip-turally, studying with them if that would be of help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> By showing this kind of loving interest in Jehovah's “little ones,” likely you, too, can enjoy experiences such as this one submitted by a traveling overseer: ‘Recently I inquired about a newly baptized sister and was told that she had not been to a meeting in five weeks. I asked a sister to call her and tell her we would like to come by the following morning. The newly baptized sister was pleased. In our discussion she admitted that she had been very “down” spiritually. She had not realized that she was so spiritually sick since she had intentions of getting to the meetings. During our visit to the congregation, she attended the public meeting and went out in field ser-stating he would like one of Je-hovan s Witnesses to call on him at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> All of us can take advantage of opportunities for informal witnessing, for each day we come in contact with people not in the truth. When traveling by public transportation, at work or school, speaking with neighbors or salesmen, waiting in lines or at a doctor’s office, and so forth—all such occasions afford us the opportunity to talk with people daily. Some brothers have found it helpful to have with them a piece of literature that they could give to one to whom they informally witness on such occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT THE TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Yes, time spent doing informal witnessing is to be reported. Some publishers write their witnessing time, informal and regular, on a calendar—be it five minutes a day or an hour or more. If we spend even five minutes each day informally witnessing, it would mean two and a half hours a month. That amount of time multiplied by the over 500,000 witnesses in the United States would amount to well over one million additional hours each month of sharing the truth with others. It would be appreciated if all would note their informal witnessing time and be sure to report it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> “As you go, preach,” said Jesus at Matthew 10:7. In accord with his direction to us, let all of us daily seek to witness as we go about our activities, appreciating that this has been the means for tens of thousands to hear and eventually respond to the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">vice as well, showing that our shepherding visit had good results.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Helping those who have allowed themselves to “stray” is a very essential part of our Christian service. With the elders and others lovingly aiding persons who have drifted away to overcome their problems, many “little ones” who are spiritually weak may be helped to grow stronger, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">People of all nations can be unified.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Why? God is not partial.—Acts 10: 34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2. How? Acknowledging God's rulership will unify people from all backgrounds.—Rev. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">7:9,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS }</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By Focusing on the Bible</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How is the response to the good news in your area? If you are not seeing the positive response you believe there could be in the territory, could it be that there is a need to focus greater attention on the Bible, using it more in the field service? Paul’s success as a missionary was a result of his focusing attention on God’s Word and reasoning with people on the Scriptures. (Acts 17:1-4) By following Paul’s example in our field service today, we can experience the joy of aiding more to become believers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Our activity in field service is vital if we are going to help others learn the truth. Never should we adopt the attitude that ‘Jehovah is looking after the preaching of the good news, so his sheep will be found regardless of whether I prepare well and share in the field service or not.’ That sentiment is not at all in harmony with the Scriptures, for at Romans 10:14 the question is pointedly asked, “How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?” To use the Bible effectively requires preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Our current “Topic for Conversation” lends itself to conversational use of the Bible. For example, we might say: “Hello. We’re making brief calls today because of our interest in the neighborhood. Don’t you agree that where persons with different backgrounds are able to live together in unity, life is more enjoyable for them? [Allow response.] Too, if people of all nations could live together in unity, would it not make your life more secure? [Allow response.] What would this require on our part as individuals? Notice the statement at Acts 10:34, 35. [Read scripture.] Since God is not partial, his Word the Bible offers the same hope to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Latter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">and in the same line of thought.” —1 Cor. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You will be happy to know that provision has been made to have each body of elders review on a service meeting some of the benefits that the Kingdom Ministry School course will bring to the entire congregation. On returning from the Kingdom Ministry School, elders are encouraged to have in mind increased field service and giving greater attention to working with publishers and pioneers so people of all kinds, and that hope includes what mankind most needs —leadership that will unify all men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> At this point we might paraphrase Revelation 7:9, 10, drawing attention to the fact that a great crowd of persons out of all nations is shown before God’s “throne,” acknowledging his rulership over them. We could then open to the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life Does Have a Purpose, </span><span class="font13">pages 44, 45, pointing out the subheading “God’s Rulership the Only Satisfactory One” and the illustration depicting God’s knowledge of our traits and individual needs. Additional points from these two pages can be used if the householder shows interest in the conversation. A similar approach, adjusting the conclusion to include points from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">World Government </span><span class="font13">book (possibly pages 160 and 175), would be very appropriate to our offer for December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> If you would like help in your use of the Bible in field service, why not approach your book study conductor or another elder and ask him to accompany you? One of the elders’ responsibilities is to train others in the field and to set the example themselves in the Kingdom proclamation. Christ Jesus provided the model as recorded at Matthew 11:1:. “Now when Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The extra effort required to prepare for and improve in our use of the Bible in the field will be richly rewarded. We can be certain that as we focus attention on God’s Word, his spirit will give our message more impact to reach the hearts of meek ones and set them to searching the Scriptures. —Ps. 119:130.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">as to share the benefits of their training and experience. We are confident that each one of you will respond warmly to this personal assistance offered by the elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Be assured of our continuing prayers in behalf of all of you, as you “behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ . . . standing firm in one spirit, with one soul striving side by side for the faith of the good news.” —Phil. 1:27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">• Is It all right to record public talks, by the brothers and then sell dupll-<sup>1</sup>--cations of such recordings to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With the advent of the portable tape recorder In recent years, many brothers are recording the talks they hear at assemblies, at Kingdom Halls and at special meetings. Sometimes these talks are played back to other members of one’s family, or to shut-ins and Infirm Individuals, or to other persons who were not present to hear the talk originally. Sometimes those making the recordings like to replay the tapes for their own enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There seems to be no objection to recording such talks for one’s own pleasure or for the benefit of others who did not hear the talks. But what if one were to reproduce such tapes and then advertise them for sale among the brothers and thus promote a commercial enterprise? Sometimes individuals do this without even asking permission of the one who gave the talk. It is one thing to record a speaker’s talk; it Is an entirely different matter to reproduce his talk and sell It to others, with or without permission. To sell such tapes puts the matter In the commercial field and this becomes a disturbing element In the congregations. It would therefore be good to avoid this unethical practice or selling tapes.</span></p>

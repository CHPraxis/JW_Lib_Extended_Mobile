<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 1978</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 21, No. 5 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19"><a name="bookmark3"></a>kingdom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">In February of this _ year, thought-provoking information on pioneering appeared in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font1"> Since then, have you considered sharing in this activity? Have any in your family expressed the desire to pioneer? It certainly is a fine thing to think seriously about the possibility of enlarging our share in the vital work of proclaiming the “good news” and making disciples. What a grand way this is to express our love for Jehovah Ged and our fellowmen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although pioneering may require making adjustments in one’s daily life, and it certainly calls for hard work, many who are engaging _ in this service have experienced rich blessings. For example, a brother with a business was able to work out a program that enabled him to auxiliary pioneer for six out of the last twelve months. What were the results? He enjoyed conducting as many as seven Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though it has not been easy with a full work load, even some members of Bethel families have been able to arrange to be auxiliary pioneers. In the Philippines, 16 members of the Bethel family were able to pioneer in one month and enjoyed conducting 41 Bible studies. Also we have heard fine experiences from members of the Brooklyn Bethel f</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font1">y who have shared in the auxiliary pioneer work. One brother told of placing hundreds of magazines. How did he do it? He took advantage of every opportunity to speak about the truth —at bus stops and in other places where small groups were gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We hope that you, too, will continue to think about how you might increase your share in declaring the “good news.” May Jehovah’s rich blessing attepd your efforts to be whole-souled in your sacred service. Be assured of our warm Christian love.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Appreciate Your Possession?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Are you enjoying your possession now? Is it the same possession that brought delight to God’s faithful servant David? Regarding it, David wrote: “Jehovah is the portion of my allotted share and of my cup. . . . The measuring lines themselves have fallen for me in pleasant places. Really, my own possession has proved agreeable to me.”—Ps. 16:5, 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Note that David found his “allotted share” in the Most High God. His treasured possession was having an approved relationship with Jehovah and being able to serve him. To him, that allotted portion was most pleasant. Unlike faithless “men of this system of things,” David did not center his life around material things. What really counted with him was being ever aware of Jehovah’s presence. On awakening in the morning, he would focus his thoughts on the Most High God. David was satisfied in knowing that Jehovah was always with him, ready to come to his aid-—Ps. 17:14, 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DOES JEHOVAH'S SERVICE COME FIRST?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> What about us today? Do we, like David, view our relationship to Jehovah and our service to him as one of our best possessions?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Widows and Orphans</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> One of the requirements of true worship is “to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation.” (Jas. 1:27) In the many congregations of Jehovah’s people there are literal widows and orphans who are in need of loving attention such as is encouraged by the disciple James. But there are also others in the congregations who are in need of loving consideration and help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> The problems faced by these persons differ considerably. Some widows may have to work secularly while at the same time caring for a home and providing help and guidance to their children. The resulting schedule may be so demanding that it leaves these sisters totally exhausted in the evening. Other widows may be advanced in age and may be facing serious health and financial problems. Still others, though enjoying comparatively good health and financial security, may find that they are lonely and depressed. Sisters with unbelieving mates may experience discouragement because of being unable to have spiritual fellowship with their husbands. Nevertheless,</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Is this reflected in our being busy in fine works, including Kingdompreaching and disciple-making? Or, are we being,, sidetracked by the daily cares of life, entertainment, some hobby or other interest? When there is a choice between pursuing either a personal desire or sharing in field service, helping with Kingdom Hall cleaning, visiting a sick member of the congregation, or the like, what do you do? Does personal desire often win out? Do you have time to watch your favorite television program or to read a novel, but just do not get around to reading the Bible or Bible-based publications? Do you spend hours in pursuing bodily training or recreation on a Saturday afternoon but find that there is no time for field service in the morning because other things have to be done? Or, do you willingly adjust your schedule of activities in such a way that after other essentials are cared for, the major part of the time remaining can be devoted to helping people inside and outside the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">i One vital way in which we can aid persons outside the congregation is by sharing in the work of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 2) </span><span class="font1">they should endeavor to win their husbands by godly conduct. (1 Pet. 3:1, 2) As for orphaned children, many keenly sense the absence of a parent. Especially teen-age boys may have difficulty discussing personal problems with their mother. In cases where the father is an unbeliever, children may be given unscriptural advice, face ridicule and perhaps even mistreatment, but they should render due obedience.—Eph. 6:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW WE CAN HELP THEM</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Clearly, orphans and widows, among others in our midst, especially need encouragement and upbuilding. For any of us to be a source of encouragement or help to all these needy ones, we need to know what their situation is. Since they do not openly discuss their problems and inmost feelings with the entire congregation, how might we determine what aid and encouragement would be appreciated? This usually cannot be done by asking directly: “Is there anything I can do for you? Do you need anything?” Nevertheless, we </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1}</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEETINGS .</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font15">Song 60. Announcements. Di’ rect attention of publishers to announcement in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font15">about not leaving tracts in mailboxes. Discussion on &quot;Do You Appreciate Your Possession?” Have a brief Introduction based on paragraphs 1 and 2 making clear the application of Psalms 16:5, 6 and 17:14, 15. Then have paragraph 3 read, and ask: Why is it good to think about the questions raised here? (There is no need to discuss each question, and it should be kept in mind that, in their place, the activities mentioned are not wrong.) After reading paragraphs 4 and 5, ask: Why is it Important to give personal attention to our field activity? Conclude by warmly encouraging brothers to take delight In Jehovah's service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —With Tract No. 25.” Review with audience material in paragraphs 1 and 2. Then present a well-prepared demonstration covering circumstances outlined in paragraph 4, using the introduction mentioned in paragraph 3. Following this demonstration, have another presentation using material covered in paragraph 5, showing how a Bible study can be started by using chapter 3 in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font15"> book, (Also mention leaving tracts when someone is not at home. Encourage publishers to make sure that tracts are not readily visible to passersby. If congregation has territories that have not been worked recently, inform audience of arrangements made to cover them with Tract No. 25.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">15 min: Branch Letter. Use material to encourage as many as possible to auxiliary pioneer during May or in the coming summer months. Song 68 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">20 min: Song 31 and local announcements. Question-and-answer discussion on &quot;Cultivate a Longing for Spiritual Food.” Review with audience the application of the scriptures quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font15">Talk on article, “Why Meditate?” in March 15, 1977, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font15">pp. 165, 166.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">30 min: Getting the Most from Bible Reading, Briefly mention that Bible reading Is a necessity for us and should benefit us personally. It is not a matter of roading for the sake of reading. When we read the Bible, we are reading </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">God's Word.</span><span class="font15"> Encourage audience to follow along as an elder or a ministerial servant reads Matthew 5:1-16. (Do not spend much time in the introduction, but start right away with the Bible reading suggested. Make sure you give an equal amount of time to each question. You may find it helpful to assign certain publishers to prepare for this part by reviewing the Watchtower articles dealing with the Sermon on the Mount.) After reading the first five verses, ask the following: Why does happiness result from being conscious of our spiritual need? How are we comforted when we mourn? Why does this make us happy? Why will the mild-tempered ones inherit the earth? Read verses 6-8, and ask: What is involved in hungering and thirsting? How are we going to be filled and happy? How can we show that we are merciful? Why would our being shown mercy make us happy? How can we be pure in heart? In what sense can we see God? Read verses 9-12, and ask: How can we be peaceable? Why would being called ‘sons of God’ result in happiness? Why could we be happy when being persecuted? Conclude by reading verses 13-16, and ask: In what way are we the salt of the earth? In what way are we a light in the world? In what way might one's light be hidden? Inform audience that further information on the above can be found in the February and March 1978 issues of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font15"> Encourage all to read the articles dealing with the Sermon on the Mount and to meditate on the information. We should be sure to take advantage of our opportunities to study and to read God's Word with a view to knowing Jehovah better. Song 100 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font15">Song 8 and announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font15">Talk on &quot;1978 Conventioners in Action!” Insert, from &quot;Christian Witnesses Live Up to Their Name” to “People Meet People.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font15">Question-and-answer discussion of insert, from subheading “Presentableness” to &quot;Maintaining Good Order.” Please read the material under “Presentableness.” Then ask: What do we learn from Jesus and the angels as to their presentableness before Jehovah during their assemblies? How can we imitate their example? Read paragraphs under &quot;Cleanliness and Uprightness,” and then ask: In harmony with 1 Peter 1:16, what responsibility does each one of us have at assemblies? Conclude this portion by reading paragraphs under &quot;Maintaining Good Order.” Ask audience: What responsibility do children have at assemblies? In harmony with 1 Corinthians 10:31, how should we conduct ourselves where we are accommodated? Why is this important? Why should we exercise care in the use of alcoholic beverages? What should be done if there is improper conduct on the part of any of the brothers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">20 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font15">Field overseer outlines local arrangements for special witnessing at the assembly that most publishers will be attending. Where brothers are accommodated at the same place or nearby, car or bus groups may be organized in advance before leaving to attend the assembly. Small groups might arrange for a convenient meeting place and then quickly proceed into the field. A group of pioneers and publishers enthusiastically discuss material from “Will You Be One of the 'Locust' Band in Action?” and &quot;Campaign Plans.” Song 89 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY </span><span class="font15">21</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;Look After Orphans and Widows.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font15">Song 108 and local announcements. Review concern of Jehovah and Jesus Christ for widows, as shown in Isaiah 1:17, 23; 10:1, 2; Jeremiah 22:3; Ezekiel 22:7; Zechariah 7:9, 10; Malachi 3:5; Luke 20:46, 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font15">min: &quot;Helping Widows and Orphans.” Question-and-answer discussion. Highlight what all in the congregation can do in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font15">min: First interview one or two sisters who are widows, and then one or two young brothers or sisters without a father or a mother. Let them tell of the joys they have in working with others in the field service, and how helping others spiritually has made it easier for them to cope with their own problems. Conclude by having various ones In the audience relate what they have noted to be especially helpful in encouraging individuals in local territory and those who are unbelievers in their immediate family. Song 85 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font15">Song 103 and local announcements. If any tracts remain from May, publishers may continue to use them in June to start conversations with people. If many tracts are still available, it may be advisable simply to hand them out without attempting to start conversations. Comment on Acts 4:20, highlighting the fact that we share with people what we have heard and seen. No reason to hold back from preaching because we do not know much about the Bible. All of us know something, have heard Scriptural truths and have personally experienced Jehovah’s help and the benefits of applying his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">15 min: What Could We Say? Invite audience to cite scriptures that could be used in giving a witness in the following situations: (1) A loved one dies. (2) Neighbor complains about unruliness of children in the neighborhood, (3) A fellow worker comments about the high cost of living. (4) A neighbor mentions health problems and the expenses incurred. (If possible, texts could be written on a blackboard.) As scriptures are cited, could ask for gist of text and how the points made in the Bible could be used. Comment on many opportunities that we have for using these scriptures in the field service and at other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">30 min: To be prepared locally. Include discussion of local plans and arrangements for all in the congregation to have some share in presenting the offer for June. Encourage schoolchild dren who will be out for their summer vacation to participate. Song 77 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>(Question $ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• How can the school overseer arrange to give private counsel after the meeting to those who have assignments in the Theocratic School?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Good cooperation of all with the school overseer will often permit his seeing most, if not all, of the four students without undue delay, right after the meeting. (It would not be necessary for the one giving the Instruction talk to be present. If something needs to be brought to his attention, the school overseer can see him later.) All should understand that this is part of the instruction of the Theocratic School. We encourage all to seek out the school overseer right after the meeting. This will assist him in being of the greatest help to each one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Occasionally, the school overseer can give brief reminders from the platform that students should see him after the meeting to pick up their counsel slips and to talk over the points on which they are working. Students who are on the program should arrive well before the meeting begins. It is suggested that rehearsals be completed at another time, before the meeting begins. If all remember to give their counsel slips and assignment slips to the school overseer before the meeting, this will provide opportunity for him to remind each one to see him after the meeting.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1978 CONVENTIONERS IN ACTION!</span></h2>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CHRISTIAN WITNESSES LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME Will You Be There To Share Unforgettable Theocratic Experiences?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">The time for the 1978 “Victorious Faith” International Conventions fast approaches. Months of planning have gone into preparations to care for more than a million at-tenders at over 100 convention cities on the six continents of the earth. These gatherings will be held in some of the world’s largest stadiums, including Olympic stadiums. The scheduled assemblies of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, people of the one true Victorious Faith, promise to be no ordinary chain of events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is believed that this interlinking of people from over 200 lands will go down in modern theocratic history as another Christian milestone. Perhaps you, your parents or even your grandparents remember attending some of the previous outstanding conventions, such as in 1941 at St. Louis, 1950 and 1958 at Yankee Stadium, New York, 1951 at the London Wembley Stadium, and 1955 at Nuremberg, Germany, to mention </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> few. While it took much time, expense and inconvenience to travel from one end of the earth to the other to meet with Jehovah’s internationally gathered people in those days, Jehovah’s blessings were there for them in abundance, truly unforgettable and rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">BIBLICAL PATTERN</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR ACTIVE CONVENTIONERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sizes of our modern conventions, even including the 253,000 assembled in New York in 1958, are dwarfed by the Biblical records of theocratic assemblies. The assembly of the Israelites in the wilderness at Mount Sinai under Moses in 1513 B.C.E., numbered over two million. (Ex. 19:1-19) But even this gathering was insignificant in size as compared to the vaster assemblies of angelic creatures in heaven, from time to time, to pay homage before Jehovah’s throne.—Job 1:6; Dan. 7:9-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such a heavenly gathering is referred to at Hebrews 12:22, 23: “But you have approached a Mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general assembly [panegyrei</span><span class="font0"> in Greek].” This Greek word literally means “to all-assembly” (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation)</span><span class="font0"> or, as a commentator on this text says, “an assembly of an entire people.”* </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s</span><span class="font0"> unabridged dictionary says concerning the associated English word “panegyris,” “an occasion for laudation (glorifying) , public praise.” So it seems that the angels not only attended to receive governmental instructions from the Universal Sovereign, but also were involved by rendering responses of praise. (Rev. 19:3) Even the Israelites at Mount Sinai made a response by way of resolution and thus participated in that convocation.—Ex. 19:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The significant Christian assembly in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., was characterized by public participation. After the 120 assembled in the upper room received the holy spirit, they went outside to preach publicly “about the magnificent things of God.”—Acts 2:1-11, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERN ASSEMBLIES HAVE FEATURED PARTICIPATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the Cedar Point Convention of 1922 a “Service Day” was set aside where hundreds of motorcars, each with five passengers, were volunteered days before to be led out into the countryside for witnessing from house to house.f At this convention and at the next</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, MAY 1978 </span><span class="font0">six successive annual international conventions, special resolutions were passed by the conventioners, indicating their further participation. These were the beginnings of a global “locustlike” campaign under the leadership of “a king*’ (Christ Jesus), featuring field preaching that eventually covered all parts of the earth. J—-Rev. 9:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1933 in the United States there were 12,600 publishers who volunteered to be ready on quick call for house-to-house field service on special missions in areas of civic opposition that interfered with the field preaching work. They were organized in “divisions.” On several occasions the “divisions” comprised 200 automobiles with five workers each. The cars would assemble at a certain rendezvous point at 9 a.m., each car group receiving a territory assignment sufficient for the five workers. Each worker was given a little bag with the special literature to be offered to the public for that morning’s field work.<sup>0</sup> By this means a quick, mass coverage was made of difficult territory in problem centers of certain cities. Indeed the Biblically described “locusts” were on the job. In effect, the Witnesses to this day continue as the foretold “locusts,” fully participating under their King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL. PLAN TO ATTEND —WORTH MAKING SACRIFICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Just as all the angels were present for the heavenly assemblies and the happy worshipers in David’s time made the effort to get to Jerusalem to participate in the singing responses and shouts of praise, so should every one of us attend today. Then like King David we will be able to say: “I will laud [glorify] you in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">big congregation;</span><span class="font0"> among a numerous people I shall praise you.” (Ps. 35:18) In Jesus’ day, he and others walked many miles to get to Jerusalem for the three happy festivals of participation each year. Yes, there were doubtless occasional inconveniences, perhaps some poor sleeping accommodations, and while traveling they may have had lesser food supplies amid heat and</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">To be assembled with the “congregated throngs” of Jehovah’s people in 1978 will likewise require making sacrifices. Money needs to be saved to travel the longer distances for you and your family. Accommodations during the five days may not be quite as comfortable as at home; they may be expensive. You will need to adjust to the large crowds, as these happily move to and fro over the convention grounds. In many assembly halls there may not be the same comforts as at home. Meals may be lighter, but the refreshments provided will be sufficient for maintaining physical strength. After all, it is the spiritual feasting that counts. So if we should have to put up with some minor creature discomforts, this will be more than compensated for by our being present as public praisers of Jehovah our Sovereign God.—Eph. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">PEOPLE MEET PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One purpose of Jehovah in gathering his people together periodically in such large throngs is that there might be an international interchange of encouragement and experiences. (Rom. 1:11, 12) We of the United States need to get acquainted with dedicated people from many lands abroad who will be visiting us at our American conventions. Therefore we should be outgoing, take the initiative to introduce ourselves and mix with our brothers from other lands. Let our children get to meet children from nonAmerican countries. At past international assemblies many friendships have been struck up and maintained by letter exchanges for years later. Enjoy every fleeting hour of the convention program during the five days, and also the hours between the sessions. Jehovah is bringing us visibly together as an international society of Christian witnesses to be viewed by the public on the world stage. Preliminary foundations for a postArmageddon “new earth” are further being laid. Are you going to be present to share in the fulfillment of God’s purposes for our day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTABEENESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can adorn the assembly, also, by dressing in an appropriate, pleasing way. It is unthinkable that Jesus in his day, and the other happy Israelites who traveled to Jerusalem for the festivals, attended there unkempt as to grooming and shabby as to clothing, or even in lounging attire. Surely the angels in heaven always make their appearance before the Sovereign Majesty of the heavens in a respectful way. So in like manner the vast crowds of Jehovah’s people, young and old, who attend the assemblies should be well groomed, cleanly dressed in good taste according to the custom of their land. It may be that some of our brothers from other countries will come dressed in their clean, bright native costumes. Take an interest in the styles and colors displayed and be eager to have fellowship with them. Get to learn a few words of greetings in their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">CEEANLINESS AND UPRIGHTNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All attendees should share in keeping the convention grounds clean and unlittered. Convention hall owners have commended us on this in the past. Do your part to keep up this fine reputation. We serve a “holy” God and therefore everything we do should be clean and upright. (1 Pet. 1:16) This likewise means that we continue to be honest in all our dealings, not only with our brothers, but also with all outsiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAINING GOOD ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At all times we and our children should exercise the fruitage of the spirit, especially that of self-control. Remember, we must live up to our name, Jehovah’s Witnesses. That means we serve a God of order. (1 Cor. 14: 33) Furthermore, being under the wise leadership of Christ Jesus, we cannot walk in the wild, uncontrolled ways of the wicked world.—Col. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the hotels, motels, private homes or wherever we are accommodated, let us walk decently as Christians. Obey the rules of the hotel or motel where you stay. Do not be marking up the property or making loud noise that disturbs neighbors. Honorably pay for the number agreed upon to stay in the room. When there are small social gatherings in the evenings, let these take place decently and with dignity. There should be a marked difference between our social gatherings and the carryings-on and antics of the non-Christians. Wherever we go or whatever we are doing, we should perform all things to God’s glory.—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We regret to have to say that in the recent past a few brothers have acted in a disgraceful way that has brought reproach upon Jehovah’s people. They yielded to the ways of the flesh. May a good report in your case come in as from one motel owner in July, 1977, who wrote: “We certainly enjoyed having your people stay with us. Your people exemplify the very best in good moral conduct and principles. I commend the Watchtower Society. You are a fine group.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A little wine makes glad the heart of man. (Ps. 104:15) But the immoderate use of it or of stronger drinks borders on drunkenness, which is improper conduct not befitting a Christian delegate at these conventions. Where there is immoral conduct of a gross nature at the conventions, the individuals should be reported to the Convention Administration so that the congregation elders where they are associated can be advised, enabling them to handle the matter properly and without needless delay. Convention times are joyous occasions, but they are not occasions for making raucous noises that disturb neighbors and outsiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE “EOCUST” BAND IN ACTION?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Friday morning of the “Victorious Faith” Conventions has been set aside for<sup>1</sup> large-scale field service as has often been featured in the past. The joy of preaching the good news in those previous years will be recaptured as we go forth like “locusts” in a unique field campaign Friday morning. The service will be open to all dedicated Witnesses in good standing, unbaptized ones who meet the requirements to serve in the field </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(or</span><span class="font0"> pp. 128-130), and any others who may wish to accompany an experienced field publisher as an observer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMPAIGN PLANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each convention will have a Field Service Department that will work out all the details to carry out the campaign locally. This department will be under the supervision of the “Program Overseer,” who is one of the Convention Committee of three. Arrangements will be made for elders and ministerial servants who have volunteered to serve as field captains at the convention city to direct groups out from every motel and hotel where large groups of brothers are accommodated. Also, every Kingdom Hall will be a center from which field service is directed for those privately accommodated in the area around the Kingdom Hall. For those who desire to come down to the convention hall itself, arrangements will be made to take out large groups by providing transportation for them to serve the outer- sections of the city and its environs. Also, the center of the city will be the scene of street work and store-to-store service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before leaving your congregation for the convention city, your elders will have organized what car groups they could for field service at the convention city. The car captain will obtain territory for the car group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By 9:00 Friday morning, groups of Witnesses should be ready to move out into the field for house-to-house visitations, street work, informal witnessing and to speak with the public wherever they are seen in small groups, as at bus stops. You will not need to bring a book bag nor learn a presentation. A simplified and effective campaign of action will be outlined for you at the assembly, where you will also be able to obtain specially prepared equipment for the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the close of the Thursday afternoon session, complete announcements and a demonstration will be given as to how to perform the service on Friday morning. Also, at the close of this Thursday session there will be released small, opaque, plastic witnessing bags for $1.00 each. Each bag will contain a supply of magazines, handbills and the release made on Wednesday. These items will be offered to the public in our field service. The plastic witnessing bag will have marked on both sides: “1978 ‘Victorious Faith’ International Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.&quot; This bag can be carried so that the public can see these words. Whatever literature is left over may be used on the way home or in your home territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each witnessing bag will have sufficient literature for one or two publishers who may work together. It may be that at each hotel or motel special desks may be permitted in the lobby from which the assigned captains may issue territory. If so, the territory for each car group could be handed out Wednesday and Thursday as family groups come into the motel. Then at 9 a.m. Friday each group may go right out into the field for about two hours to complete the small assignments. There will be no need for assembling together for text and prayer. A few additional witnessing packages could be on hand Friday morning for those who may not have obtained their service kit at the assembly hall. Publishers may wish to bring their personal Bible along in case persons in the field ask questions that require a Bible answer. The plastic bag will be of sufficient size to hold the Bible in addition to the other items. The few words that need to be said at the doors will be explained at the close of Thursday afternoon’s session. Where the people do not accept the offer for the suggested contribution, the publishers should use the handbills to invite them to the convention sessions and the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon completing your service in the field you may return directly to the convention site where refreshments will be available from 12 noon until time for the afternoon program to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a 1978 conventioner, plan to be in action in the field during this very special campaign. It will remain in your theocratic memory as a blessing from Jehovah. Like David, may we be able to say: “Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—Ps. 26:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Widows and Orphans </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font1">can learn a great deal about their true situation from observation and by listening to their casual remarks. For example, facial expressions and evidence of fatigue can tell us much. The more we converse with them at the Kingdom Hall, while with them when sharing in field service, or in their home or ours, the better acquainted we will become with their real needs. We should, of course, avoid prying into their affairs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> After ascertaining areas where help and encouragement are needed and would be appreciated, we should follow through to the extent possible. It may be a matter of assisting with home cleaning, washing or shopping. Sometimes material aid in the form of money, clothing or food, may be appropriate. (Compare 1 Timothy 5:310; 1 John 3:17, 18.) It could be very encouraging for persons in need to be invited to accompany you in the Bible study activity or on return visits, as well as in other field service activities. Then, too, including them in wholesome social activities may be beneficial in filling their need for companionship. —Luke 14:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Of course, a person must exercise care that he does not force his attention on someone who may not particularly be drawn to him. When a brother really has concern for a boy in an unfortunate circumstance and shows this by his genuine warmth and interest, the boy usually will respond in time. The relationship will develop naturally, perhaps without either the brother or the youngster having to say anything about it. For example, they may really come to enjoy working in the field service together and interchanging thoughts and experiences. While the brother can never actually fill the role of the boy’s father, he can be a confidential friend. Because of the age difference, he may be like a father, but rightly realizes that he is more like an older brother.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>B</sup> Just how much a person can do is, of course, governed by circumstances. A single brother, for example, may be limited in what he could do to assist a widow and her children so as not to give any wrong impressions. On the other hand, such widows should not interpret attention given to their children as evidence of interest in them as a possible marriage mate. Often it is best for sisters to assist widows or for married couples to do so together. Moreover, if any</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivate a Longing for Spiritual Food</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">* Do you have a longing for spiritual food? Are you looking for opportunities to increase your understanding of the Scriptures to strengthen your own faith, and to be better equipped to help others to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth? How do you feel when a day passes without your having given much thought to spiritual matters? Do you sense a certain emptiness?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Our having a real longing for spiritual food does not come automatically. Before we became disciples of Jesus Christ, we may have been completely absorbed with the daily affairs of life and pleasures. Hence, a person must exert himself to get out of that routine and to begin centering his life around spiritual things. The apostle Peter urged new believers: “As newborn infants, form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word.”—1 Pet. 2:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>s</sup> But not just new ones should be concerned about their spiritual appetite. (Heb. 5:14-6:2) Just as a person cannot continually neglect his physical needs and expect to do quality work day in and day out, he cannot have strong, sustaining faith without feeding himself spiritually. When repeatedly faced with the unresponsiveness of relatives, acquaintances and people in the territory, he may find that he does not have the spiritual fortitude to keep on witnessing, convinced that he is doing God’s work and that the reward is sure. (1 Cor. 3:9; Heb. 6:10; 11:6) Without a proper spiritual diet, a person simply cannot be enthusiastic about declaring the “good news.” His heart will not be filled to overflowing, causing the mouth to speak. —Luke 6:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO CULTIVATE A SPIRITUAL APPETITE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> This gives rise to the question, What can we do to improve our aid is given to children unaccompanied by parents, we should take into consideration the feelings- of living parents and not undermine parental influence and direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> As in the case of all other members of the congregation, we can be a source of encouragement to orphans and widows and other afflicted ones if we are alert to their needs and respond to these to the extent our circumstances allow. It is really a matter of heeding the admonition of the apostle Peter: “Have intense love for one another.”—1 Pet. 4:8. spiritual appetite? We do need some definite stimulation to move us to want to consider spiritual things. The apostle Peter called attention to this when he wrote, “provided you have tasted that the Lord is kind.” (1 Pet. 2:3) So, if you find that your desire for spiritual food is not what it should be, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">take time to think about what you have already tasted.</span><span class="font1"> In fact, all of us can benefit by reflecting on questions such as these: What evidence can I point to that the Lord Jesus Christ has been kind to me? Am I not indebted to him because of his having given his life for me? Has it not brought joy to my heart to be in association with his disciples who have genuine love among themselves? Am I not grateful for Jehovah’s mercy and undeserved kindness? Our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">considering these things time and again</span><span class="font1"> can have a wholesome effect on our heart, moving us to want to show our appreciation to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> How will this appreciative attitude manifest itself? We will want to be taught by Jehovah and his Son through the pages of the Bible and Bible-based publications. Also, we will be stirred to imitate their perfect example. Yes, it takes effort to read the Scriptures and Biblebased publications and thereafter to think about what we have read and to apply the information to ourselves. But is it not true that maintaining good friendships always requires effort? And what could possibly be of greater value than taking steps to grow in our love for Jehovah and his Son? May we, therefore, work at having and maintaining a good spiritual appetite so that we can prove ourselves to be friends of God and Christ, and an encouragement to our brothers. Furthermore, may we be diligent in helping others to form a longing for spiritual food by stimulating their appetite with the good things we have already tasted.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">may find it advantageous to mention briefly why many people are concerned about the reason for our existence and that many have been pleased to learn that a reasonable and satisfying answer is available. At this point you could direct attention to the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> On the other hand, the householder may be interested. Therefore, you may wish to use a scripture from the section, “Why, Then, Are We Here?” and read it, either from the tract or the Bible. If you ascertain that he has the time, introduce the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> book. You could open to chapter 3, “A Paradise Home Ahead,” and read the first three paragraphs. Then consider some of the questions on that material. Thereafter, offer the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font1">book and make definite arrangements to continue considering the chapter. Try to stimulate the householder’s interest in reading the material by calling attention to the subheadings in chapter 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Of course, we cannot expect to start a study with most of those on whom we call. In fact, some householders may not even want to converse. Nevertheless, we should try to leave a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 25 with as many as possible and encourage them to read it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Appreciate Your Possession (Coni’d) Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking. Of course, no one can determine for us individually how much time we should be devoting to this activity. But would it be consistent for someone who really loves Jehovah to think that it does not matter as long as he at least does something, when he could have done much more? Could a person say that he appreciates being able to serve God and Christ when he spends more time in pursuing a hobby or some other pleasure than he does in spiritual activities? Is he really giving his best?—Compare Malachi 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Recognizing that we will be called to account by God and Christ, we do well to examine how we are using our time. (Rom. 14: 10; 2 Cor. 5:10; compare Luke 12: 35-40, 47, 48.) We have chosen to serve them, and, therefore, have received priceless benefits, including the forgiveness of our sins,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">See Presenting the Good News. Use any scripture in tract that you find appropriate for your territory.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Tract No. 25</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> How fine it will be for all of us to share in distributing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 25 for the entire month of May! Along with the tract, we shall also be using the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> book or magazines. The subject matter of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 25 should have wide appeal. As people face the daily anxieties of life and note the world’s mounting problems, they often wonder, “Why are we here?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Again we encourage you to use the tract to start conversations. The scriptures that are quoted in this particular </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> are| ones that we commonly share with others in our witnessing. So you may wish to select a text that you could easily use to stimulate interest in the Bible’s message. It may be helpful to talk with other publishers to see what they have found helpful in getting conversations started. Especially if you recognize a need to become more skillful in witnessing with the Bible, you may wish to make definite arrangements to share in the tract work with another brother or sister. And, when unable to work with an experienced publisher, do not hesitate simply to present the tract and to offer the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> book. If your circumstances allow, why not enroll as an auxiliary pioneer? By spending more time in the field, you may be surprised to see how much easier it becomes to start conversations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Whether we are experienced in declaring the “good news” or not, we do need to think about something definite to share with others. The subject we will be discussing is furnished by the tract—“Why Are We Here?” How can we </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">get </span><span class="font1">into the subject? A person might say something like this: “I have stopped by to share with you the answer to a question that has puzzled many people. Have you ever wondered, Why are we here on earth?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Possibly the individual will say that he has not thought about the matter at all. This may simply be his way of telling you that he is not interested. In that case, you</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">divine help and guidance, and the promise of eternal life. So, then, the way in which we are spending our time should harmonize with what we have agreed to do and should show appreciation for what Jehovah God and Jesus Christ have done for us. We can ask ourselves individually: Would I want to stand before God and have my record of fine works reviewed? Am I willing to pray as did David, “Examine me, O Jehovah”?—Ps. 26:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Perhaps realizing that we may not have used our time well, we might be apprehensive about being examined now. If so, we should think seriously about making improvement in the future. Our love for Jehovah and Jesus Christ should move us to be whole-souled in serving them. If we do what we reasonably can, we will have no reason to fear a careful examination of our record as Christians. In fact, we will be happy to have our record of fine works reviewed, confident that Jehovah will reward us.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Truly, we want to be like David, finding delight in our relationship with Jehovah and our service to him. If we continue to view this as a priceless possession, we can look forward to standing as approved before the judgment seat of our Master, Jesus Christ, and hence, also before Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>

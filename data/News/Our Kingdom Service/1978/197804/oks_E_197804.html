<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>OUR </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM SERVICE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 1978</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 21, No. 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">^Deait</span><span class="font16"> ^Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Over the years we here in the United States have enjoyed seeing thousands of new ones share in Kingdom preaching. Other lands continue seeing such growth. Already by November of 1977, Italy had a peak of 68,000 proclaimers of the “good news.” In Japan a peak of over 43,000 publishers have reported, with publishers averaging more than 15 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We want to aid as many more as possible during whatever time Jehovah yet permits. At the same time, we also have a deep concern “toward those [already] related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) It is interesting to note that, in addition to the more than half a million publishers regularly sharing in the preaching work, about 100,000 others report service at least sometime during the year. Hence, many thousands who are not reporting service each month are still associating with us and still love the truth. Could it be that they are hesitant about talking extensively at the doors? They may lack confidence and thus need our help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is urgent that we all be alert to whatever needs our brothers may have and help them in any way we can. We want to assist all to strengthen their “hold on the real life.” (1 Tim. 6:19) Jesus knew that what lies ahead will require all of us to have the strength that comes from being active, whole-souled in our service. Hence he urged us to ‘pay attention to ourselves’ and to “keep awake” that we ‘may succeed in escaping the things that are destined to occur.’ —Luke 10:25-28; 21:34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Having taken up the service of God, may we never lose our zeal and confidence. Rather, may we demonstrate that we are “the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Be assured of our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Your brothers, </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Treat Them as Individuals?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> How long has it been since you tried a fresh approach to householders in your territory? Even if we use the same presentation at each door, we are giving a witness, and that is important. But some publishers have learned to adjust what they say to fit the individual householder. They observe that, as a result, more people listen, and they personally find greater enjoyment in their field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Recently we wrote to a number of pioneers and circuit overseers and asked how they give a witness on an “individual” basis. We’d like to share some of their replies with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO GET THE DISCUSSION STARTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> The way that they introduce themselves varies. One sister says: I “Hello! My name is . . . and I’ve I stopped for just a minute to share i a very encouraging thought with you.” Another says: <sup>(</sup>‘I have a very interesting message to share with you concerning the Bible as a practical guide. It will take only five minutes.” They know that before they can do much adapting of their presentation, they need to catch the householder’s attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> In some areas the brothers find that there is better response if, instead of mentioning God or the Bible in their opening statement, they briefly refer to some basic human desire or a problem that is on the minds of many persons. But a circuit overseer says that, when</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What Do You Do with Your Magazines?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Each time you receive a new issue of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> magazine, what do you do with it? Is your immediate reaction that of one who may be called a “caption reader,” who merely flips through the magazine, noting the titles and other highlights? Or, are you a “picture reader,” delighting in the illustrations? Or, are you a “specialinterest reader,” particularly attracted to some special features of the magazine, such as “Questions from Readers” or “Insight on the News”? Or, do you do something else?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Admittedly, each issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> stirs a certain measure of expectation, and it is most satisfying to thumb through its pages while it is still fresh. But now we are faced with the question—What then? What do you do with the magazine after that initial spark of interest is satisfied? Could it be that it is simply tucked into a other approaches do not bring good results, he gets right to the point. Without any preliminary greeting and with his Bible in hand, he says: “I’m stopping by with this little gem from the Bible.” Then he reads Psalm 119:105.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Most of these experienced brothers and sisters agree that being warm and having a friendly smile is important.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BE OBSERVANT ‘</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Of course, each householder is different. But how can you find out what the interests of the individual are?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> A circuit overseer suggests being observant: “Is the householder elderly? Are there toys in the yard? Are there bumper signs on the car indicating their personal crusades —political, religious or environmental? Does a window sticker say they are a ‘block parent’? Are they poor in worldly assets, or rich? Are there burglary devices on the door, or big guard dogs to safeguard possessions? Any of these things can give indication of what will be of special interest at that door.” Don’t make just passing mention of these things; tie your discussion back to them a number of times, the brothers recommend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO GET ACQUAINTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Even more important than observing </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">things</span><span class="font15"> is taking note of the reaction of the individual, says an-</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 7, col. 1) </span><span class="font15">drawer and forgotten? Or, do you, perhaps, carefully file it away so you will know exactly where it is when it comes time to prepare for the congregation </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> study, and so feel you have done your duty? Or, do you at least leave it out somewhere, figuring that you will give it more attention later, only to find that, somewhere along the line, it gets buried among other things and is out of sight?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Whether any of these examples are true of you or not, they certainly fit some of us, don’t they? Perhaps it’s not our intention to be so negligent, but with so much demand on our precious time each day, we may just feel that, after all, the “food at the proper time” is in the study articles and they will be covered at the congregation </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> study. As for the other articles, some may feel that many of them are merely a review of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 7, col. 2)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEETINGS )</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">7 min: Song 65. Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: What Is Our Attitude Toward Preaching? Audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When Jesus witnessed to others, what was the message he emphasized? (Luke 8:1) What message did he foretell would be proclaimed during conclusion of present system? (Matt. 24:14) God’s purpose has not changed; the message to be proclaimed has not changed. Ask audience: Why is it vital to the public that we keep on preaching the Kingdom message? Why is it important to our own spirituality that we not be indifferent about doing so? (Rev. 3:1416) As shown in the Branch Letter (pars. 2, 3), who might really appreciate it if we invited them to go with us in field service? Not knowing the date when the “'great tribulation” is to begin does not diminish the urgency. Do not forget Revelation 18:21, also Luke 21:34-36. Let’s all be zealous in our service to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Our Topic and Literature Offer for April. Ask audience what the Topic for Conversation for April is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Discuss details as to literature offer. Ask why it is beneficial to offer Wafefe-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font13"> subscription, what there is in the magazines that can help people with their problems, how this can give them hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">25 min: “‘Do You Treat Them as Individuals?” Not actually studying article with congregation, but using ideas from it, conduct the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Demonstration: Publisher making house-to-house calls. (As Indicated below, involve the audience.) Publisher greets householder, emphasizes badness of world and presents a prepared talk. (Use current Topic for Conversation.) After a minute or so, interrupt to ask audience for their impression. What would make opening remarks more positive, upbuilding?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Demonstration starts again, publisher says something that Is more positive (see par. 3 of article), but makes no effort to involve the householder. Stop publisher again; commend. Ask audience what we know about the householder’s interests. How could we find out? (Pars. 6-9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Publisher tries again. Gets householder to comment: she mentions something about her own life. Before continuing, ask audience how they would fit discussion to householder. What would they show this person, to emphasize that the Bible is a practical guide ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Instead of demonstrating this aspect further, ask audience what they would point to In the Bible to show that it is a practical guide in other common situations. (For example: Crime, poverty, pollution.) List texts on a chalkboard. Add comments from paragraphs 11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Briefly show how subscription might be presented to the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Encourage publishers to apply what has been discussed. Song 66 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Song 111. Local announcements. Talk, with some audience participation, on article “What Do You Do with Your Magazines?” With first paragraph, encourage audience to relate what they actually have been doing with magazines, not necessarily what they should do; do not belittle. Then build appreciation for practical value of material in magazines. Encourage audience not only to read the magazines but realistically to consider suggestions given in paragraph 8. Introduce next part as example of how to apply these suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">25 min: Lively discussion of article “Human Kindness Essential for Happiness,” in February 15, 1978, Watchtower. Have a book study group familiar with entire article and prepared to offer comments from audience, not just prepared for preassigned questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Pars. 1-3: What human kindness Is, and how experience cited illustrates it. Would you have acted differently, or what would you have done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Applied in Everyday Living”: Ask wives: What “little things” do your husbands do that you particularly appreciate? Husbands: What kindnesses on the part of your family do you appreciate ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“In the Christian Congregation”: How should we view the ones who have special needs? How can we help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Section on “Benefits.” Invite comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Ask: Have you enjoyed what we just did? Why not do it with family? Urge audience to read and use what is in the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Have audience name articles that they feel can fit particular persons on return visits, and explain why, (Could arrange one or two beforehand.) Arrange to have experiences related by individuals who are successful in using magazines in field service. Encourage all to read and make full use of magazines. Song 55 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Song 96. How Important Is It to Follow Up?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A major part of our work is making disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Briefly interview some local publishers, ones who were aided because someone patiently called back on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Comment briefly on how many return visits congregation made last month. How many publishers have shared in making return visits during four out of the past six months? (Obtain figures from congregation records.) Is there need to give greater attention to this activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">25 min: “Presenting the Good News —Making Return Visits.” Use material in paragraphs 1, 2 for brief introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Instead of simply studying paragraphs 3, 4, ask congregation: “How do </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font13"> decide whether to make a return visit on a person? When might it be beneficial to call back on a person even if he did not accept literature? Has anyone actually done that? When do </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font13"> set aside time in your schedule for making return visits ? How much of your service time do you use in making return visits and conducting Bible studies?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Instead of simply asking questions on paragraphs 5-7, demonstrate conclusion of a house-to-house call, showing how to apply one of the suggestions. Then ask the audience for further ideas as to (1) how to lay the groundwork for return visits, (2) what notes to make on their house-to-house record, (3) what preparation they make, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Demonstrate paragraph 8. Ask audience for observations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Raise problem: What if householder is too busy? Demonstrate suggestion in paragraph 9. Then ask audience what </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font13"> recommend for any who are having difficulty In finding people at home when they call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Make this a spontaneous discussion, drawing on experiences of congregation. Use material In article as basis for the demonstrations and for your own additional comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Aid Persons with Whom We Already Have Some Contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Comment on local attendance at recent Memorial. Are they continuing to show interest in Jehovah’s provision for life? Can we help them? Invite the audience to comment on the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Did a member of your family come, one who does not usually attend meetings? What can be done further to encourage such ones ? (Why not invite one of the elders to call now, to get better acquainted, perhaps to offer a study, if that seems appropriate?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How can we aid persons who attended, with whom studies are regularly conducted, but who have not continued to come to meetings? (Might arrange for the book study conductor to visit them, to commend them for progress, to encourage them to continue associating with the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Were there some in attendance who used to be regularly associated, who were baptized, but who are not active now? How could we help them? (Might they need a study again to build them up spiritually? Offer the help.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Let’s plan this week to have some share in making return visits. Song 81 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Song 61. Announcements, including local field service arrangements^ Discussion with audience about importance of being at the convention this year, using some points from first section of assembly insert. Ask audience for suggestions on how to overcome obstacles to one’s attending. (For example: Secular obligations, travel expenses, ill health, “I'll just go for the weekend.' ’)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">30 min: Elder discusses with audience insert section under “Praising Jehovah with Good Conduct.” Read designated scriptures and any paragraphs that elders feel may apply locally. How should our conduct reflect on Jehovah’s people? (1 Pet. 2:12) How has the type of conduct spoken of in Ephesians 5:3, 4, 18 brought reproach on us In some cases? (ff4) At assemblies what can happen when children are allowed to be on their own? (Prov. 29:15; 1J5) How can we avoid leaving a poor impression with innkeepers and homeowners? (f6, 7) What responsibility do we all have in order to fulfill the principle of Proverbs 27:11? (518) How can we take the lead in “showing honor to one another” in the matter of saving seats? (Rom. 12:10; fl9, 10) Apply Ecclesiastes 5:1 to our paying attention. (1111)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Briefly consider points in insert from “Volunteer Service” to end. Have brothers from audience prepared to ask questions of one handling part: “What happened to the Volunteer Service forms?” (Briefly explain new arrangement and why.) &quot;Will there be a cafeteria?” “Will we use those tear-off tickets to pay for food again?” “I always enjoy the orchestras. Will we have them again this year?” Summarize remaining headings with a sentence or two each, especially noting unusual Friday field service arrangement. Song 91 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">D</span><span class="font0">OES that theme whet your spiritual appetite? Does it also stir up fond memories for many of you who have been privileged to attend previous international conventions? How faith-strengthening it will be to join with our brothers from other lands at one of the 24 large conventions arranged for the continental United States and Canada. You will be truly happy that you have put forth the effort to be there all five days for the bountiful Scriptural instruction and guidance in serving Jehovah faithfully in the days ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Past international conventions have often had outstanding special features, and this one will be no exception! There will be no morning session on Friday. Instead, the morning will be devoted to a unique field service arrangement throughout the convention city. All are urged to share in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, leave no stone unturned in your efforts personally to attend the 1978 “Victorious Faith” International Convention. You will reap rich rewards for doing so. The following information is being provided to assist you to benefit fully from the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAISING JEHOVAH WITH GOOD CONDUCT: </span><span class="font0">As in the case of those with opposing mates, the Bible shows that even opposers can be won to the truth without a word. How? By our good conduct of which they are eyewitnesses. (1 Pet. 2:12; 3:1, 2) Many favorable reports result from the good conduct of Jehovah’s people at conventions. Some have been so impressed by what takes place that they have embraced the truth. (1 Cor. 14:23-25) What an impelling reason for us to watch carefully what we say and do!—Phil. 2:1-4; John 13:35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> One city mayor stated: “Yours was a most orderly session, and the delegates certainly brought a great deal of credit to themselves while they were here.” Good manners and actions motivated by love also go a long way in enhancing the enjoyment of the convention for everyone in attendance. And, above all, such faithful conduct honors our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah, bringing his smile of approval upon us.—Prov. 27:11; Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> By far the majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses at such large conventions have proved themselves to be fine Christians. Yet, sadly, in recent years a few disorderly ones have cast a poor reflection on the rest of Jehovah’s people. Even though only a few engage in these things, the good name of all of God’s people and of Jehovah himself is involved. Some of the matters that will now be mentioned may seem shocking to you, but we thought you would want to be aware of these problems so that, if possible, we all can help to avoid them in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> A few of our brothers have had a tendency to become less careful in conduct when away from their home congregation. Often their lack of Christian restraint occurs away from the convention site, while associating after assembly sessions at motels and dormitories, eating establishments and other places. Some have even arranged to rent clubrooms and bands or go to discotheques in the evening. In some instances, a lack of self-control while engaging in worldly dancing has resulted in great reproach, even leading to immorality. Parties in motel and dormitory rooms have, on occasion, become boisterous and unruly to the extent that excessive drinking occurs and numerous liquor bottles and debris are left for maids to wonder about and clean up the next day. (Eph. 5:3, 4, 18) In one instance a brother called the management about a loud, boisterous, late party going on in the room next door. What would you have done when the management said, “They are Jehovah’s Witnesses”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Reports also show that parents, at times, have allowed their children to stay alone at motor inns while they have gone out for periods of time; also, to use swimming pools unattended, even after closing time for the motel pool. Some parents have not intervened when their children ran, yelling and screaming throughout the motel, when they used elevators for play, sometimes resulting in serious damage, or when they set off fire alarms or threw rocks into pools and at cars in parking lots. Such conduct has been a real irritation to some worldly motel guests and managements, as well as our brothers staying there. Is it wise or Scriptural to leave children, dedicated or not, on the loose either at the stadium or at our lodging places? Loving, responsible parents will keep their children with them and be companions to them, at all times knowing where they are and what they are doing. The resulting good conduct of our children can bring much praise to Jehovah. (Deut. 6:6-8, 25; 31:12; Prov. 29:15) One brother commented: “When we had evening sessions, publishers were too tired to party and the children usually went right to bed.” Now there is opportunity to use the evenings to review the program with our families and to associate with some of our brothers in quiet, orderly Christian fellowship. Those who use the time in this way are spiritually upbuilt and have no regrets.—Ps. 133:1; Eph. 5:15-19; Phil. 4:8, 9.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, APRIL 1978</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> Sadly, reports show that there have been some cases of individuals who have been less than honest in obtaining rooms. As one innkeeper said, “Two people register, five occupy the room, plug in hot plates, and call the office for more towels.” Innkeepers in at least six cities have reported that persons attending our assemblies have done this. Because of these bad examples, a few motel managers have even said that they do not want Jehovah’s Witnesses back and would rather have anyone else stay there. What a sad contrast to the favorable expressions usually heard.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> We appreciate it very much when our brothers and others hospitably open their homes to visiting delegates for our conventions. Those of us who request such accommodations should remember that we are their guests and should act accordingly, not taking undue advantage of such Christian hospitality. Rooms listed in private homes do not include the use of the kitchen, or provision for animals. Also, those who request accommodations in private homes should never bring a disfellowshiped person with them. The convention will not assign any disfellowshiped person to a private home. Keep in mind, too, that such rooms listed at reasonable cost or free of charge are available only as an aid to attend the convention, and not to go to some vacation spot or tourist attraction in the area. If a person is going for such activities, it is only fair to others that he stay in a motel or hotel. Rooms listed in private homes will be available only during the convention and not for periods before or afterward for personal activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Remember, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not loved by the world. (John 15:18, 19) Our actions are therefore given extra scrutiny. Worldly people would like to have an excuse for pointing an accusing finger, but we want to work hard to turn their scrutiny to praise for Jehovah by keeping our conduct far above the standards of the world. (Prov. 27:11) Since any who travel or stay with us while attending a convention are identified by worldly people as Jehovah’s Witnesses, what can be done to help these individuals to conduct themselves properly? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Every Christian, especially elders, parents and mates, should feel personally responsible to aid disorderly ones among us, dedicated or not, to change their conduct while with us by kindly helping them to act properly.</span><span class="font0"> If elders or parents are not present and cannot be readily found, then any Christian present could calmly and kindly point out that our reputation and Jehovah's name are involved. By assisting everyone with us to appreciate this, no doubt we will regain our fine reputation in those areas where it has been damaged.—2 Cor. 1:12; 6:3, 4; 1 Tim. 3:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> A good opportunity to bring praise to Jehovah is right at the convention itself, by taking the lead in “showing honor to one another,” treating others as we would like to be treated ourselves. (Rom. 12:10; 13:810; Matt. 7:12) Such loving consideration of others can outstandingly be shown in the matter of saving seats. It has been observed that magazines or other items often have been placed on blocks of seats, sometimes extremely early in the morning. Some of these seats were never occupied during entire sessions, forcing others to stand. At other times seats are not available because some use them for storage purposes. Would it not be the Christian way to keep our things under our own seat, on our lap, or in the checkroom? Instead of thoughtless actions, why ■ not rather bring honor to Jehovah by lovingly offering seats to elderly or infirm persons who need them?—1 Cor. 13:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> This year, in view of the above, convention attendants are being instructed to allow persons without seats to occupy any empty ones that are needlessly being saved. This will be 10 minutes before a session begins. Of course, a balanced view will help us to realize that at times it is necessary to save a seat or two for good reasons—family members who are volunteer workers, interested persons who will arrive soon, or a trip to the washroom. But if you need to meet someone, why not arrange ahead of time to meet at a certain time and place before or sifter the sessions so that you will not have to save seats for each other?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> When we realize that the stadium facility actually becomes a large Kingdom Hall for us, it should move us to show deep respect for Jehovah by being in our seats as family groups when each session begins and ends so that we can hear the entire program, including the prayers. Just as we, whether young or old, would not inconsiderately roam in the corridors at the Kingdom Hall or wander outside, talk to others, or leave in a mass exodus ahead of everyone else, we should not do so at a larger place of worship either. In this way we show respect for Jehovah’s spiritual table.—1 Sam. 15:22, 23; Eccl. 5:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font0">To share in serving your brothers at an assembly, it will no longer be required that each individual turn in an Application foi' Volunteer Service. In fact, none of these forms will be sent out to the congregations this year. Already the convention committees for each city are functioning and the various department heads have been selected. All these brothers, as well as individuals they have selected to work with them in their departments, have been busy asking various brothers in the congregations and circuit assembly organizations to share in the work with them. Of course, some larger departments such as Attendant, Food Service, Cleaning, Auditing, and so forth, will still need many more volunteers. This is where you will be able to contribute to the success of the convention when the convention organization gets in touch with your congregation. They will write to your congregation’s Convention Coordinator, who is coordinating other convention matters for the congregation as well. He will be given a form for each department still needing volunteers, and will announce the need. Your name can then be listed on the form for the department you would like to work in for the entire convention. After processing these lists, the Volunteer Service Department in the convention city will send a form to the congregation’s Convention Coordinator showing where and when those working in each department should report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Of course, for those who may be able to volunteer for only one time, such as when your congregation is asked to share briefly in cleaning a small section of the stadium after the afternoon sessions, your help will still be needed. The convention organizations this year, as in the past, will still be selecting congregations to share in this one-time work in several departments. So, you will be able to volunteer for this with your family and others in your congregation, even though you are unable to work all five days. In order to arrange for this, the convention organization in your convention city will advise your congregation of the need and have your elders select a capable captain for the group who will work along with you in caring for the assignment. The Convention Coordinator will receive the necessary correspondence in plenty of time to work out the details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> It is hoped that this new arrangement will make it easier for you to volunteer and to find out well ahead of time what you will be doing and where to report for work. Of course, even if you are not able to volunteer ahead of time, if you are able to help, please just go to the Volunteer Service desk at the convention and they will let you know where help is needed and guide you to that department. Truly, there is much pleasure in lovingly serving your Christian brothers as you volunteer individually or as family groups, with even younger ones working along with their parents or older members of the family. —Acts 20:35; Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD SERVICE: </span><span class="font0">In view of the changing lifestyles and eating habits in this country over the past few years, as well as the change to daytime sessions at conventions, much thought has been given to just what is necessary in the way of physical food in order to care for the needs of those in attendance. Especially has consideration been given to what might be done for the thousands of faithful, hardworking volunteers who, over the years, have devoted their time preparing necessary physical food so that the rest in attendance could enjoy the bountiful spiritual food. In the past such dear ones have often had to work so many hours that they themselves have heard very little or none of the program.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> After considering all these factors, the Society has decided to simplify the entire food service operation so that nearly everyone, including those working in the Food Service Department, will be able to hear and benefit from the spiritual program. Hence, instead of serving a cafeteria meal at any convention in this country, there will be a fine tasty menu served out of conveniently</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">located refreshment stands. Hot items such as chicken, fish, hamburgers, hot dogs and coffee, and cold items, including large sandwiches, fruit bags, Danish pastry, potato chips, chocolate and vanilla pudding, orange juice, soft drinks, milk, and so forth, will be available. There will be plenty to eat and it can be easily obtained throughout the stadium so that, if you wish, one or* two members of the family can obtain all the hot or cold food needed and bring it back in a bag. This type of menu prepared with modem mobile kitchen equipment owned by the Society will make it possible for the vast majority of food service volunteers to hear the spiritual program as well as serve the physical needs of their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION TICKETS: </span><span class="font0">For a number of years now at our conventions, $1.00 tickets in 10c segments have been successfully used for purchasing food at the conventions. In many ways, including safety of funds, sanitary benefits when handling food, and speed, since no change-making is required, this system has proved much more acceptable than using money. In order to use these tickets to the best advantage, it would be appreciated if, to the extent possible, you would comply with the request to order a supply of tickets ahead of time for the first two or three days of the convention. This will help to eliminate crowds waiting in long lines at the cashiers on the first day. Then you can go later at your leisure to obtain more tickets as needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Since each ticket is printed to show it is worth 10c, all the menus at the conventions will show how many tickets are required to purchase each item, rather than showing a price. This should speed things up considerably and increase accuracy. Your cooperation in using the tickets will be appreciated and contribute to the smooth operation of the convention feeding program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSIC: </span><span class="font0">Special music for the interludes and for audience singing is being prepared by the Society with the aid of many brothers throughout the country who are talented musicians. This means that there will be no live orchestras this year, but the specially prepared music will be presented by tape to give real unity to this important feature of the program at all the international conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">May Jehovah truly bless your efforts to finalize your arrangements to be in attendance at the “Victorious Faith” International Convention along with your brothers.—Heb. 10:24, 25; Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">International Convention Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font13">Any desiring rooms who have not as yet sent in a Room Request form should fill one out neatly and accurately and turn it in to the congregation Secretary or the Convention Coordinator. He will carefully check it over, sign and mail it to the rooming address noted on the back of the form for the convention city where you will attend. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans, please immediately advise (1) the landlord and (2) the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There will be no trailer camps at the U.S. conventions, but the Rooming Department for each convention will gladly furnish available information on any commercial facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font13">Why not begin planning now to have a joyful share in the outstanding special field service morning that is being arranged for Friday at each convention city? You will be blessed by engaging in this activity, distributing literature, some of which is being printed especially for this occasion. A very simple presentation will be used, so even young ones and new publishers will find it easy and enjoyable. More information on this stimulating activity will be published in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font13"> for May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font13">At most locations, the immersion will be on Saturday. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should review the 80 questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font13"> book with the elders prior to the convention. Bathing suits and towels should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font13">Plan to enjoy the entire program, which will begin Wednesday and Thursday mornings by 10:00 and will conclude at approximately 6:00 p.m. Of course, on Friday the entire morning will be set aside for the special field service campaign mentioned earlier. Thus, the actual program at the stadium will begin on Friday afternoon at 2:00. On Saturday and Sunday the program will begin by 9:15 a.m., and it will conclude at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. We encourage you to arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to the conclusion at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font13">This year, instead of sending a special Convention Pioneer Identification card to each </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font13"> pioneer, as in the past, we are asking all </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font13"> pioneers to bring to the convention their current Pioneer Identification and Assignment card that was issued when they were appointed as regular pioneers. You may present this card to the proper cashier on the first day of the convention and receive §15.00 worth of convention tickets for obtaining food. The cashier will simply date stamp the back of your Pioneer Identification and Assignment card to show that you received the tickets. If a free copy of any literature release item is available to pioneers, you may go to the bookroom and someone there will simply write the number of that release in ink on the back of your card to show that you have received your free copy. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. All those in special full-time service (traveling. Bethel and special pioneers) will continue to receive the Convention Pioneer Identification card as in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font13">No doubt all will enjoy wearing the cards as a means to advertise the convention and to get acquainted with other brothers and sisters in attendance. Congregation Secretaries, please have the international convention lapel cards and holders ordered on the Literature Order Blank starting April 15. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font13">Regardless of the convention you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk if possible. Also, beware of pickpockets. They often mingle in large crowds. For the same reason, do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the convention.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Magazines &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">material already quite familiar to those of us who have been in the truth for some time. So, we are not missing that much, are we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Well, perhaps we are missing more than we realize. How is that? Not everything in those shorter articles is simply review. Some of it is quite new. Sometimes there are comments on Scripture texts that may not have been discussed in the Society’s publications for thirty or more years. We may also find a fresh approach to a familiar topic, or details that are expressed with a clarity that enables us personally to get a real grasp of the subject for the first time. All of this will be missed if we do not read those articles, won’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> But, what if some of us do find that the article is simply a review? Why should we spend the time on it? Because that is the way we feed our hearts. (2 Pet. 1:12, 13) It is not by always seeking something new but by reviewing and meditating on what we already holder cuts you short. Instead, thank Jehovah for the privilege of speaking in his name. Now, try another home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>13</sup> The brothers find that once the householder sees that the Bible [ really does deal with his own problems in life, he. often is grateful for literature that will help him to learn more. During April we are going to be offering the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font15">subscription, along with one of the 384- or 416-page books, for $2.00. And we know that during the year they will get a lot of excellent information that shows what the Bible says about situations of many kinds: marriage, raising childfen, coping with economic pressure and <sup>1</sup> discouragement, the lasting solution to health problems, and much more. It can really help the individual to appreciate how the Bible can be a light in his own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> Never forget, the householder ■ is an individual. Get acquainted. Then use what you have learned to help him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>15</sup> Did you get some helpful ideas from what these brothers and sisters in full-time service do? Then I review them before you go out in the field service during the coming weeks. May it add much to your finding joy in aiding others as you serve Jehovah.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Treat Them as Individuals </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font15">other Witness. At one door, as soon as she mentioned God, she observed that tears came to the eyes of the woman. Instead of going on, she asked, ‘Is there some problem?’ Indeed, there was. The woman’s son had been murdered two weeks ago, and she just could not understand why God had permitted it to happen. The publisher was able to help her—a little bit that day, more later.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> A pioneer who has been in full-time service since the early ‘40’s frequently learns quite a bit about the persons to whom she talks, and she makes good use of it to help them. How does she do it? She writes: “From door to door I very often use this: ‘Hello! I’m so glad to find you at home, because we are neighbors. [Here I tell them where I live in the city, as I think this is important, since most people in the city don’t know others and are very apprehensive.] We both are concerned with the well-being of our families, isn’t that so? How’s everybody at your house? [Here I learn of illnesses, problems, and if they’re alone.] Isn’t it too bad that more people don’t care what happens to others these days? [I often insert some recent specific local case.] What do you think the problem is?’ ” If they will talk, she listens.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">USING THE BIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> But now we want to direct the discussion toward the Bible. How? Well,<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark7">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark8">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark9">3</a></sup>&nbsp;this pioneer says that, when the householder’s comments bring certain problems to light, she asks: “Do you think God expects us to look to him to straighten things out, or is it just up to us?” Even if the response is negative, it is not hard to say: “That’s how many people feel, but I read something here in the Bible that would interest you.” Now, which scripture are you going to use?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> Well, which promises in the Bible are especially precious to you? Share one of these with the householder. If you have difficulty in remembering where they are, then write down a few choice ones. Don’t worry that perhaps you won’t know what to say. Trust in Jesus’ promise that the holy spirit ‘will bring back to your mind’ the things that you have learned from him. (John 14:26) Simply be willing to share these things. Do it in the kind and loving manner that was characteristic of Jesus, and those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life” will listen.—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>12</sup> You know that not everyone is going to listen. Not everyone listened to Jesus. So don’t feel that you have failed when the house-know that we build up our appreciation for the truth. And this is what keeps us in the way of the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Furthermore, such articles often help us in a practical way. For example, “Are You Prepared to Talk on the Bible?” in the November 1, 1977, issue has helped some to overcome the tendency to shy away from talking about the Bible to persons with special backgrounds. How about something for the family? If you feel you can use some practical suggestions on how to strengthen family ties, the article “Helpful Suggestions for Maintaining the Family Circle” in the February 1, 1978, issue may be the answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Of course, the fact is that not all of us are going to get everything in the magazines read. Not all of us read at the same pace, and not all of us have the same amount of time for personal study. But, let’s be sure that if we are not covering it all, it is not because of lack of concern or because worldly reading material or entertainment is more appealing to us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Looking ahead, what practical application can we have in mind so we will read such material with the proper objective, rather than just out of a sense of obligation? Many of these articles can be excellent material for our family study. Too, the information we gain from such articles can become interesting topics for upbuilding conversations with fellow Christians. Our being personally acquainted with the magazines surely will build up our enthusiasm for recommending them to others in the field. Indeed, by our making it a point to read and apply such material j regularly, meditating and pondering over it, our lives will be enriched immensely and our advancement will be manifest, to the benefit of ourselves and others. —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> An important part of the work that Jesus assigned to his followers was to make disciples. Not only did he say that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached,” but he also commanded: “Make disciples . . . teaching them.” (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Are you sharing in this aspect of the Lord’s service? Would you like some suggestions on how to go about it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The key to disciple-making is to spend time discussing the truth with people. The Bible reports that, on one occasion, Jesus invited two interested persons to his lodging at about 4 o’clock and spent the rest of that day with them. (John 1:39) Thereafter they traveled with him, being taught by him for a number of months before they were next back at their fishing business. (See </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font15"> book, chart on page 928.) Soon they were very active pro-claimers of the good news. In Ephesus, the apostle Paul made provision so that those who wanted to learn could spend time with him every day, if they so desired, to build up their knowledge of the truth. (Acts 19:9, 10) A fine congregation was formed there. We, too, will get results if we arrange to spend time with interested ones on a regular basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> But you might say that you don’t have any return visits to make. Perhaps you do. A return visit on anyone who takes literature is usually appropriate. Also, a brother in California makes this interesting comment: “This month I have made arrangements on the initial call to come back and speak to 26 persons. What’s interesting to me is that 22 of them did not accept any literature! However, they were willing to express a view on a scripture I wrote down for them to look up in their Bible.” Why not try it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> In the case of publishers who do not make many return visits, they usually do not have a regular time for this activity. Do you? Instead of always covering more territory, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">it can be very fruitful to spend up to half of your witnessing time calling back on persons that you met before.</span><span class="font15"> Give priority to those who showed the most, interest,, but, as time permits, also call on those who showed just a little interest. You may do this on the same day that you go from house to house, or, on occasion, you may want to spend the full period of field service to make return visits. Do not neglect them.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> When you meet an interested person, possibly in the house-to-house ’work, it is a good idea to lay the groundwork for your return visit. How? One of the most effective ways is by using a definite question. If the householder asks one, why not use that, promising to do some additional research and go over it with him on your next visit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> But perhaps the householder does not ask a question. Then what? You do it. A longtime pioneer in Alabama gets excellent results from asking questions himself. On his first call he may have been discussing the theme “Is This the World’s Last Generation?” When that has been answered, he says: “If this generation will see the world’s end, that raises some interesting questions: • What will be on the other side of the end of the world? Will the ground be left? Will any humans live through this destruction?” In a letter this brother remarked: “At this point I end the discussion, with the householder hungry for the answer. So successful has this method been that some people have had us come back three or four times a week; others have prevented us from leaving the house until we gave the answer, one man even locking the door.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Before you make your return call, prepare. Have a few scriptures in mind, but not the identical ones that you used on your first call. Don’t lay the foundation again; build on it. You can get good ideas from </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion. </span><span class="font15">Be sure to pray for Jehovah’s spirit and for him to open wide the heart of the householder.—Acts 16:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> You don’t have to figure out in advance every point you are going to cover; but it does help to know how you are going to get started. Have in mind (1) the householder’s name, (2) what you talked about last time, and (3) what scriptures you could use to cultivate further interest on a topic that appealed to the person. After greeting the person by name, you might say: “I’ve been thinking about you since we had that enjoyable conversation on the Bible last week and I hope you’ll have a few minutes so I can share what I’ve been reading about. [Mention the previously asked question or whatever topic you plan to use.] May I come in?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> If they say they are too busy, use discernment. You might reply: “I understand.” But then ask: “Could I have just one minute to</span></p></li></ul>

Please provide his full name and address, the name and address of the previous Secretary, and the congregation name and number. Please also provide this same information for the PERMANENT SHIPPING ADDRESS. If this is the same as the Secretary’s name and address, please so state.

Then read one of the scriptures that you had in mind and comment on it. Keep it brief. Let them know that you had some other points to share, and arrange to call again. Often a number of brief calls are needed before the householder’s spiritual appetite begins to grow. Be patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> In many areas the big problem is to find people at home. Don’t give up. Lives are at stake. Try the telephone. Write a letter. Leave a recent magazine in the door, perhaps with a personal note drawing attention to an article that you think will especially interest the householder. Sometimes after months of repeated efforts, fine studies have been started. Keep in mind that our work is not done when we have gone from door to door. Our commission is also to “make disciples . . . teaching them.”</span></p>

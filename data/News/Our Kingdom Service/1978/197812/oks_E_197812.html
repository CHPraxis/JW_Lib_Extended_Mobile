<p><span class="font12">The Service Office here in Brooklyn was happy to see how many of you responded to the invitation extended on the second day of the “Victorious Faith” International Convention to join the ranks of regular pioneers. Pioneer service was encouraged in the talk “Pioneering in the Steps of the Master.” What was the result? In August we received 741 new applications. This is the highest number received in any one month in four years. It was encouraging to note that many of these came from married couples. We hope that many more will be able to increase their service by regular pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have also been very busy scheduling pioneers to attend the Pioneer Service School. Twenty-nine classes were held this fall, from September through November. Twenty-six were in English and three in Spanish. With few exceptions, all the traveling overseers’ wives and special pioneers have now attended in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the instructors made this comment: “Several students mentioned having reached a point of discouragement in their assignments, and how they felt a need for some definite encouragement and meaningful assistance.” He then quoted a student’s comment: “The Pioneer School is like an answer to a cry for help.” It was also reported that a 92-year-old pioneer sister, serving where the need is greater, was happy she was able to attend, because it taught her to be a better teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are confident that all of us will receive benefits, too, from the pioneers who have been through the school.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah loves people. He has shown this in spiritual as well as physical ways. Although we have many things today for our physical enjoyment, we do not want to overlook the fact that Jehovah provided a message of hope and good news as far back as when Adam was in the Garden of Eden. Should it not be the desire of all appreciative creatures to imitate God’s love for people?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW GOO SHOWS LOVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The evidence of God’s love for people is all around us and can be seen in the physical creation itself. With what remarkable care it has been made for the health, pleasure and welfare of man! The greatest manifestation of God’s love for mankind was the gift of his faithful Son, Jesus. (John 3:16) However, where would we be if He had not provided the Bible and a means to get its message to us? The Bible provides answers to our questions on life and gives us hope for the future. We have all this and more because God loves people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WE CAN IMITATE HIM</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Can the quality of love be imitated by us lowly, imperfect creatures? Yes it can. Paul says: “Therefore, become imitators of</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In the final talk at the “Victorious Faith” International Convention this past summer, the speaker announced plans to have a campaign in December when the beautiful new publication </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> would be featured. Now that we have become acquainted with the contents of this new book, what a pleasure it will be to participate in a concerted effort to share this information with others!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> With eagerness we have anticipated this time when we can give as many persons as possible an opportunity to obtain this attractive publication with its 116 vivid stories that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. As you talk to people in the territory, offer </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories </span><span class="font12">first. Although this book contains much that is of interest to old and young alike, you may find that some older persons will say they do not have children or grandchildren. Then it may be better to offer them the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> and a pocket-size book. There may be some individuals who do not have a Bible. They may prefer to obtain the Bible and a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love.”—Eph. 5:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you work hard speaking about God, unceasingly showing your heartfelt love for people, never allowing yourself to become inactive or even irregular in service? Many persons may yet be found through the preaching of the good news, and taught Jehovah’s way to salvation. Sometimes this means giving a Jittie extra of our time and energy, but the rewards are great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The apostle Paul willingly gave of himself in declaring the good news to others though it meant much suffering and self-sacrifice. He said: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house. But I thoroughly bore witness. ... I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”—Acts 20: 20, 21, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> Many of our brothers are demonstrating this same zeal and faith today and are receiving many bless-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font12">copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories. </span><span class="font12">So adapt yourself to the various situations that may be encountered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMENTS ON “MY BOOK OF BIBLE STORIES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> At the time this new book was released, how our hearts were thrilled when we heard the speaker at the international convention say: “Our loving heavenly Father and his Son know the responsibility you parents in the congregation have. They want to help you. Through the faithful and discreet slave this new publication, especially for children, is released: It is entitled ‘My Book of Bible Stories.’ ” Since then the Society has received many expressions of appreciation for this publication. Hearing some of these comments should stimulate our enthusiasm as we use this new book in the field service during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> One elder stated: “How thrilling it is that the Society can now produce a book that is so visually appealing for our young ones! This splendid publication, with magnificent color pictures on almost every page, adds a new depth to our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

(1 Tim. 4:12) This part should provide a review of some highlights from Friday’s &quot;Victorious Faith” International Convention program.

In addition to the young people’s own expressions, the following are some highlights that may be covered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1) God must be kept in life’s activities if their life is to be a happy one.

How happy we are that our children, who now learn visually in school by television, can benefit from this splendid visual aid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Some children read the whole book before the convention was over. One youth said: “It is good; it tells about all the Bible stories.” Another youngster commented: “I like it because it breaks things down so I can understand them better. In the Bible you find words you cannot understand. This book puts it in language easy for us to understand.” A parent exclaimed: “The wonderful book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories,</span><span class="font12"> especially designed for children, has been enjoyed equally as much by myself as by my seven-year-old son!”</span></p>

This makes it easy to read at night when I am very tired.” This older sister added: “My son who is a printer has expressed his professional admiration for the quality of workmanship it contains.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Another of the friends observed: “This book will appeal to the general public because its format will make it a lovely gift.” We do have, as one person observes, “an outstanding spiritual gift from Jehovah.” We pray that Jehovah will bless your efforts in using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> to help others to come to appreciate his goodness and purpose.—Ps. 40: 9, 10.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Youths, How Do You View Elders?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> There is much good that can be accomplished by Christian youths today. People are immediately impressed when they see youths displaying respect for others, stability in life and good moral character. Even young children bring praise to Jehovah by their fine conduct and sincere expressions about him. (Matt. 21:15, 16) It is indeed praiseworthy when young people overcome the “desires incidental to youth” and follow a course that is an influence for good upon others.—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The elders in the congregation have the responsibility to help all, including the youth, to grow in knowledge, faith and stability. (Eph. 4:11-15) Although the primary responsibility for helping youths belongs to the parents, elders, too, can do much to supplement the efforts of the parents. Especially is this helpful in those families where there is no father in the truth. (Jas. 1:27) For elders to accomplish this in the fullest measure, it is vital that there be a good working relationship between them and the youth. This good relationship depends much on how youths view the elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> How do you view the elders in your congregation? Do you view ■them as experienced Christians whom you can freely approach with any question or problem? Do you view them as men who can assist you in a practical and reasonable manner? If not, why not? Some youths have implied that they feel older ones, including elders, do not understand them. But have you really sincerely tried to communicate with them? Remember, older ones were at one time teen-agers. They may appear to be narrow in their viewpoint at times, but could this be due to their having already learned the hard way that the course they are counseling against can bring harm? (Heb. 12:7-11; 13: 7, 17) Listening intently to wise counsel from elders is a course of wisdom.—Prov. 4:4, 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> On the other hand, elders can analyze their way of dealing with the youths in the congregation. Are they proving themselves to be approachable, “mild-tempered” and “lowly”? (Matt. 11:28-30) It is understandable that youths and others tend to be hesitant to approach them if they are otherwise. There could develop an attitude in imperfect men to overlook youths. Even the apostles fell prey to this tendency.—Mark 10:13-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is urgent that youths and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Appreciation for the Congregation Book Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Meetings in private homes could well be the oldest and most widely attended of Christian gatherings. In apostolic times groups of Christians met in private homes to discuss God’s Word. (Philem. 2) And today, besides the tens of thousands of congregation book study groups, we find in many of the 46 lands where the work is banned that small groups of our brothers are meeting in private homes for Bible study. This, in fact, is the only kind of meeting possible in many of these lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The congregation book study is usually in a private home. How do you feel about this meeting? Are you taking full advantage of this provision, or do you regard it as less important than the other meetings? Lower attendance at the book study in many congregations would indicate that some feel this way. What about you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Consider some of the following benefits of the book study arrangement of which all of us can take advantage: (1) The groups are smaller, with better opportunities for close fellowship. (2) It is easier for all to comment freely since the material to be covered is not too lengthy and the group is small; also, we can get answers to questions on points not entirely clear from our personal study. (3) It provides a convenient center for organizing field service where this can be arranged during the week. (4) Conductors can get to know you better and are in a good position to assist with personal problems, give training in field service and help you with Scriptural questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> With this brief review of the benefits of the book study arrangement, how can we all best show our appreciation for it and in some way contribute toward making it a success?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Let’s start with you, the publisher. How can you contribute something to the book study where you are assigned? Simply being there on time, or better still, a little early so that you can upbuild the group is a loving thing to do. By advance study of the material you are prepared to incite others to love and fine works by your comments. Showing respect for the home and furniture where the study is held is also very important. What about your dress and conduct as well as that of your children? Do these reflect the fact that you are attending a meeting arranged by Jehovah’s visible organization and where his spirit is present?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The family in whose home the study is held would want to make</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">certain that to the best of their ability conditions favorable for study and concentration prevail. Are ventilation, temperature and lighting conducive to relaxed, comfortable study? (Acts 20:8) Are you prepared and in your seat when the study is about to start instead of occupied in another part of the house? Do you make those attending feel welcome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ The book study conductor holds the key position for making the entire arrangement a success and of greatest benefit to all attending. As a conductor, have you thoroughly prepared the material? Have you read the Scripture citations? Do you ask meaningful auxiliary questions? Do you endeavor to have all participate, including the children, and yet not embarrass anyone by putting him on the spot? The conductor should be interested in the spiritual development of all in the group and that they become skillful in “handling the word of the truth aright.” (2 Tim. 2:15) He should endeavor to be well acquainted with all who are assigned to the group and make it a practice to visit them in their homes. Where it is not possible for the book study location also to be a meeting place for field service, the conductor will be sure that arrangements are made for his group to meet for service each week at a time and place convenient for them. The publishers also benefit the most when the conductor makes positive appointments to work in service with each one on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>a</sup> Are some groups getting too large for the location? Or is the group so small that it is discouraging to the few who attend regularly? Congregation elders will want to be alert, in such cases, to make whatever adjustments are needed. In some areas it has proven beneficial to rotate the locations for the study if there are additional homes available. In this way a burden is not placed on someone if he has had the study in his home for many years and would be happy for someone else to be the host for a time. It is a real privilege to have one of the book studies in our home and wherever circumstances allow, we should be eager for the opportunity. (Prov. 3:9) At such locations where the householder is pleased to have the study in his home and the location is quite suitable, a change would not be necessary if no other factors dictate that the study be moved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">PRESENTING THE GOOD HEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>A number of Christian youths have proved themselves quite effective in presenting the good news. Many times older ones will give ear to the Kingdom message presented by a youth because of the deep, positive impression of seeing a young person involved in Christian activity. Other youths tend to listen more readily to our youths. Many of these young people are seeking answers concerning the purpose of life and other religiously related matters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What can you young people do to take advantage of your favorable situation to give a meaningful Kingdom witness? Many have found it helpful to become adept in using the Bible in the field. This, of course, takes more effort than just presenting the magazines or other literature without a conversation on a Bible text or two. However, it is found that a deeper impression is made on the householders when they note your skill in using the Bible. Also, this use has an enriching effect on you personally.—Heb. 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When talking to older persons it helps to have a respectful approach, showing you recognize the benefits of their age. (Lev. 19:32) For example, when introducing the current Topic for Conversation to an older person you could say: “I </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Book Study </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">Some reports have been received that studies are being held in places that are less than adequate for the locality. Does the condition of the room set aside for the study reflect appreciation for having the study in one’s home? Elders will want to remember that the book study is an extension of the local arrangement for congregation meetings and fills an important role in our study and worship.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> The congregation book study fills a vital need in our spiritual progress. If some of us have failed to see the reasons for the emphasis being placed on this important arrangement, it would be good to take a fresh look at our view toward the book study to which we are assigned. Do we see why we all should have deep appreciation for this loving provision from Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How to make your way successful.—Josh. 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Meditate and act upon what is written in the Bible. </span><span class="font12">am a student of the Bible. I am concerned about how things are going in the world. I know that you have seen much more change in the world than I have. What do you think the greatest need is if people are going to have success and contentment in life?” Then you might ask them if they feel that following the direction given at Joshua 1:8 would help the situation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When you meet another youth in your field service, make a real effort to use the Bible. As indicated at our international convention this summer, many youths are showing a sincere interest in religious matters. A young scientist who conducted a revealing survey interviewed 800 schoolchildren and found that 60 percent of the children stated something to this effect: “I often concern myself with the question of God’s existence.” We can take advantage of this interest on the part of young people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> For example, when we meet a youth in our house-to-house work, could we get him involved in a discussion by simply saying: “I would appreciate getting your viewpoint on a matter. Do you think it is more logical to believe that we were created by an intelligent super-being or that we came into existence by chance? [Allow time for an answer.] The Bible shows that God created us and left directions as to how we could make a success in life.” Then discuss the point in Joshua 1:8. You could use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book. Many teen-agers have found benefit in the simple summary of the Bible in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.</span><span class="font12"> Some have asked for the book simply because a publisher showed a series of pictures with brief comments on them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In view of the advantages youths have in giving an effective witness to both old and young alike, they should be encouraged to have a full share in Kingdom service. There are benefits for them and benefits for those to whom</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">’ JULY 1978</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol, 21, No. 7 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark3"></a>‘^Kingdom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">How faith strengthening it was for all of us to be present at the Memorial o£ Christ’s death this spring! The incomplete attendance figures for the continental United States indicate that 1,258,837 were assembled, with 4,293 partaking. Early reports from other countries reveal that over 101,000 attended the Memorial in Japan, which is an increase of about 14,000 over the attendance there one year ago! Peru had 45,647 attending, which is about 7,000 more than last year. Now it is our privilege to encourage and assist the many thousands who attended the Memorial with us to become active praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the past few months branch committee members and their wives from all over the earth have attended a special five-week Gilead course arranged by the Governing Body. We truly enjoyed our association with these faithful ones. Four classes have been completed with 105 brothers attending. School sessions were approximately six hours daily, with additional time spent working with various departments here at Bethel. The brothers appreciated observing the operation of the factory and the Bethel home so there could be an interchange of ideas for improving the work world wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A refreshing treat for the wives of these branch committee members was the opportunity they had each day of joining their husbands for the first session, consisting of a stimulating Bible discussion. In most cases, the married brothers were able to bring their wives. We certainly were encouraged by the experiences these brothers and their wives related to the Bethel family while they were here. Also, we enjoyed very much the worldwide flavor their foreign accents and customs brought into our midst.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach Others by Evangelizing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus felt so strongly about the evangelizing work when on earth that he said: “I must declare the good news [evangel] of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 4:43) Thus, when he engaged in the evangelizing work, he devoted many hours of the day to spreading the good news. At times when he was seeking rest and food, he was willing to forgo both in order to teach the interested ones about his heavenly Father. (Mark 6:31-84) What an aid such an attitude was in reaching others!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Paid reflected the same attitude as Jesus toward sharing in the evangelizing work. He felt it was an obligation that he had to discharge. (1 Cor. 9:16) Do you feel the same urgent need to participate in the evangelizing work? Paul was willing to give Iris “soul” in order to accomplish this work. (Acts 20:24) How helpful such an attitude can be for us as we do the evangelizing work that we have been assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> There are many ways we can do the evangelizing work and reach those searching for the truth. Jesus stressed personal contact in the homes. (Matt. 10:11-13) He also went from city to city and village to village. (Matt. 9:35) Paul did witnessing “in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.” (Acts 17:17) He witnessed to informal groups also. (Acts 16:13) Philip gave a witness to someone traveling on the road. (Acts 8:2630) Also, Andrew witnessed to his relative. (John 1:40, 41) So, we</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Select the Best Meeting Times .</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our Christian meetings are a part of our way of life, are they not? ■ They provide us with the opportunity to receive spiritual food, instruction for witnessing and the best of association. Each one fills a specific need so that all of them together provide us with a balanced spiritual diet. When Paul said “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together,” he must have had all the above thoughts in mind. (Heb. 10:25) To slight our meetings in any way could result in a loosening of our “tight grip on the word of life.” (Phil. 2:16) That could be disastrous in these final days of the time of the end.—Luke 21:34-36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is reasonable that we make the wisest use of our dedicated time. (Col. 4:5) Yet, reports have been received indicating that some desire to rearrange meeting times with a view to providing more have many excellent examples to follow.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> While you are traveling to a convention, perhaps some of you will find it possible to reach someone by evangelizing. Or, you may be vacationing and have the opportunity to converse with someone in an informal manner. Occasionally vacations may include visits to relatives who may not be in the truth, but who perhaps would be receptive to an informal discussion of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> While traveling from city to city and stopping at a service station to get gas, or stopping at a restaurant to eat, we may find an opportunity to give a witness to an attendant or a waitress. They may ask where we are from and how we are enjoying our trip. Such an occasion may arise when we are traveling to a convention, or returning from one, and could present an opportunity to leave appropriate literature to help to spread the “good news” and plant the seed of truth in the heart of such ones. Or, it may be that, while we are staying at a motel, opportunities will arise to have a conversation with the manager or one of the workers. Of course, how we conduct ourselves while using these facilities also is a way we can give a witness.—Titus 2:1-14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> There may be occasion, too, to work territory that is not frequently covered. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fot</span><span class="font10"> example, some congregations may be able to travel </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 2, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font10"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“free” time for recreation on the weekends. What basic factors should motivate our thinking when selecting meeting times? Should it be a desire for pleasure? While we may have individual preferences, our prime concern should be selecting meeting times that will enable the majority of our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">brothers and interested persons to</span><span class="font10"> attend. Secondly, because we are interested in the spiritual welfare of the people in our territory, meetings should be arranged so that we share in field service when we can accomplish the most good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Local circumstances must always be taken into consideration when selecting meeting times. In a few cases there is little choice as to meeting times because four or five congregations meet in the same Kingdom Hall. But, when this situation does not exist and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 16. Local announcements and Branch Letter. May be handled by several brothers appreciatively considering material together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Demonstrate current offer using suggested presentation. Have someone demonstrate both regular and abbreviated presentation. Audience may comment on good points they observe in presentation as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Good morning. I am calling to discuss the need we have in common tor a workable solution to moral and governmental problems. Do you feel that man will be able to solve the growing difficulties in crime, economics and politics? [Mention something of local interest.] Whether one is optimistic about man’s ability or not, the problems we face make some wonder. ‘If there is a Creator, why has he allowed these conditions, and does he offer any solutions?’ I was pleasantly surprised when someone shared this text with me. [Read Proverbs 2:21, 22.] Isn't it reassuring that the Creator purposes to fill the earth with upright individuals?” (Show how the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> subscription will enable a person to learn more about God's purpose for the earth.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another introduction might be: “Good morning. In view of the changing moral standards, a person could at times question whether it is worth while anymore to try living an honest, morally upright life. Have you noticed that tendency among some?” (Then show Creator's viewpoint.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">30 min: Stimulating review of &quot;Victorious Faith” International Convention. This should be scheduled the week following the assembly that your congregation is scheduled to attend. Brothers should be assigned well In advance to present information on each of the following matters: (1) Things learned regarding field service, including experiences enjoyed on field service day. (2) Things learned relative to family life, including relationships with brothers and sisters basic to Christianity. (3) New things learned from God’s Word. (4) Experiences we enjoyed personally or heard that demonstrate faith. If your assembly has not been held as yet. you may take 10 minutes to discuss the May 15. 1978, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">article entitled, “All Ready to ‘Go.’ ” Use the remainder of time for local needs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">25 min: Panel discusses June 15, 1978. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> article entitled, “More ‘Workers’ Needed—Can You Share?” Discussion followed by 10 minutes of experiences emphasizing not only joys and blessings of pioneer work, but how some have been able to arrange their affairs to become regular and auxiliary pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Accounts report. As time permits, consider appropriate material from May 1, 1978, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> article entitled. “How Important Is Christian Giving?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 58 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Field overseer discusses following material. Arrangements made for evening witnessing during summer months. Emphasize advantages: More people at home, more relaxed and possibly more receptive. Encourage congregation to care for infrequently worked territory.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font8">Demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Chairman: A major objective in house-to-house work is to reach the hearts of sheeplike persons with the good news. If we can start friendly conversations, we are well on the way to reaching that goal. If you have difficulty starting conversations, you may find it helpful to ask questions. Viewpoint questions are best because they get the householder talking rather than merely answering Yes or No. You may find it helpful to ask someone who is good at starting conversations to work with you in field service so you can develop this ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Discussion with audience. Chairman asks: “What questions do you find helpful in starting conversations and keeping them going?” After audience has made suggestions, as time permits consider the following questions that can be used in an introduction: “What kind of future do you want for your children?” “What kind of future 'do you envision for yourself in the next 10 or 20 years?&quot; “What do you feel is the number one problem in our neighborhood?” “If you had the power to change one thing to benefit mankind, what would it be?” “What do you think is required to have good government?&quot; Scriptural answers to these questions can be found In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font8"> or in current offer itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(8 min.) Present brief, realistic demonstrations using the most appropriate questions. Show how additional questions can be asked to keep the conversation going so that a good witness can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman: We are looking</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach Others by Evangelizing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">into rural areas and reach persons in this way. Other congregations have territories that include vacation resort areas where many persons will be spending time at a vacation home and could be reached during the summer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We may have the occasion to use some means of public transportation and could start ■ up a conversation with someone sitting next to us on a bus, train or airplane. When traveling, some persons are very willing to talk about world conditions, the breakdown in public services, or other subjects that lead into a Bible discussion.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Let All Things Take Place Decently’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was an orderly person. He wanted to see “all things take place decently [“well behavedly,” fn!.].” (1 Cor. 14:40) We today would do well to follow the principles embodied in Paul’s words in all our conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For example, how do visitors feel when they enter the Kingdom Hall? Are they welcomed and made to feel comfortable? Are they introduced to others in the congregation by the first ones to meet them? Or, do they enter and find everyone busily engaging in conversation but not noticing them? Sometimes publishers become so involved in conversations with each other that they fail to notice new ones, or greet visiting brothers. Is this an area where we can better arrange our affairs?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Also, it has been noticed that in some Kingdom Halls children could conduct themselves in a more decent manner. Some are found running around in the Kingdom Hall. Others have been talking loudly outside the Kingdom Hall and disturbing neighbors. Of course, parents want to take the lead in correcting such conduct by supervising their children, beginning their training right in the home. But the elders also have a responsibility to help those needing assistance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach Others by Evangelizing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">some subscription blanks in addition to literature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> So there are many opportunities open to us to evangelize as we try to reach all persons searching for the truth. We have fine examples of faithful men in times past who were dedicated to giving a thorough witness because they felt obligated to carry out the commission given to them by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. Some did this work from house to house and others informally, such as in the marketplace, by the seaside or on the road while traveling. We can do likewise and receive the joys of sharing in the evangelizing work. Our mission is to reach as many persons as we can. The time remaining in this system of things is limited. We should do everything possible to see that we complete the evangelizing work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Would it not then be good to make this work a matter of prayer, individually and as family groups, perhaps praying before we leave our homes? Surely Jehovah will bless our efforts if we let him know of our desire to reach as many as possible in the evangelizing work this summer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> It has been found that many children are permitted to make frequent trips to the rest room or drinking fountain during the meetings. One congregation count revealed that 40 of the 120 persons in attendance left the meeting to go to the rest room or drinking fountain. Also, some elders are walking around during the meetings. Perhaps leaving our seats unnecessarily could he avoided even during the songs and prayers since such are part of our worship to Jehovah. It has been noted that some are able to engage in recreation for long periods of time, perhaps one hour or more, and not feel the need to discontinue such activity. Is it not more important to value spiritual matters and meetings and remain present while they are in session?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In some Kingdom Halls chairs have been damaged. Some have been marked up with writing instruments. Others have been torn </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ot</span><span class="font10"> cut. Also, rest rooms have been left in disorder. Could it be that we should give these matters more attention than we are presently doing? Are we proud to show our Kingdom Hall to visitors and new ones since it is kept clean and in good repair, or do we shy away from this due to its poor condition?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> Perhaps we could all give attention to these matters. It is our responsibility to see that Jehovah’s house of worship is kept clean. We want all to be attracted to the Kingdom Hall because of its cleanness and good condition, inside as well as outside, and also because of the decent conduct carried on within it. Jehovah’s Witnesses have been noted for good decorum wherever they go in the world. Surely we do not want to lose that fine reputation. Therefore, let all of us take an interest in our conduct that it may bring glory to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah. —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">In most cases, the publisher conducting the Bible study is in the best position initially to determine when a student is ready to participate in the evangelizing work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is essential that the student develop a strong love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus. (Eph. 3:18, 19) His heart and mind must be affected by the truth. Help him to meditate unselfishly on the many expressions of Jehovah’s love for mankind. Endeavor to get him to apply quickly what he is learning In his personal life and to think of the needs of other people. This can be done best by asking thought-provoking questions and progressively reasoning with the student. See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font8"> book, pages 128-130.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is recommended that we spend sufficient time preparing our student for participation in field activity and endeavor personally to work with him from house to house. Have him share in the public preaching work as much as possible, learning to use the Bible in conversing with householders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When any new ones desire to get started in the preaching work and feel that they have made progress and are ready, encourage them to talk to one of the local elders about it. They will be pleased to render any assistance that might be needed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">interested to know that 30 sessions of the Pioneer Service School were conducted in 26 locations throughout the country during March and April. The wives of circuit and district overseers were privileged to attend, as well as many special pioneers and some regular pioneers. So far, more than 1,000 full-time workers have already completed the course. In fact, many of us here at Bethel have enrolled in an abbreviated version of the course, and we appreciate our opportunity to attend along with our brothers and sisters in the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Plans have been made for additional classes to be conducted this fall. Regular pioneers who can serve in areas where the need is greater will be included in the fall classes. If your congregation has a graduate of the Pioneer Service School associated with it, we know you are already aware of the rich blessing this school has been to our pioneers. We send a warm expression of our love and prayers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By Tactfully Developing Conversations</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A pleasant conversation with a householder often results in a fine witness being given from God’s Word. However, it is often a challenge to start conversations since people are so preoccupied with their own affairs or have unfounded opinions regarding our work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What might we have in mind that will assist us in tactfully developing conversations? Our own attitude is very important. Have we earnestly prayed to God to help us to find honest-hearted persons and then to aid them spiritually? Do we view each householder as a potential servant of Jehovah? If so, then we will likely be in the proper frame of mind ourselves to convey the truth to others in a loving and tactful manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> It is good to reflect on the loving example of the apostle Paul who was willing to put forth extraordinary effort to adapt himself to the varying circumstances he met in the field. His earnest, heartfelt desire to aid others to understand God’s Word was well expressed at 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23: “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.” We too, should be willing to expend ourselves in behalf of the householder, not viewing him as an opponent to be overcome, but as a prospective sheeplike person to be helped. (Luke 10:5, 6) Persons can often detect if our attitude toward them is negative. So, we should approach each house in a positive spirit of peace.—Eph. 4:29; 6:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Some persons are able to start conversations by commenting on God’s purposes and then pausing to let the householder express himself. Others have found that when they do this the householder may listen politely, but they have difficulty getting him involved in the conversation. If you find yourself in the latter category, why not try asking tactful questions to encourage the householder to participate?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Of course, when you ask a question you do not know what the householder will answer and so you should be ready to adjust your theme accordingly. When your comments in response show your recognition of his viewpoint, you may bo well on the way to enjoying a lively conversation. Try to keep it going by introducing further information from the Bible dealing with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font10"> interests or by asking further thoughtful questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Begin your conversation with things that you believe are of concern to the householder, briefly showing the problem and then leading </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10"> to the Bible’s solution. When he makes an observation, comment on what he says so he will know that you are listening. ■Your interest in his thoughts and why he feels that way will encourage him to continue conversing with you. Try to find points of agreement and stress these. Remember, in most cases you may have only a few minutes to talk. So, while you will likely not be able to agree with everything he says, it is usually better not to criticize his views quickly. Rather, keep your conversation positive by emphasizing the blessings of God’s kingdom as the solution that the Bible offers for man’s problems.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">? When a differing viewpoint arises, you may regard it as a matter of mutual interest. You can even say that you are glad he brought the subject up. Consider it as a key to continued conversation. If the householder is willing to reason, you might even ask, “Did you ever think of it from this standpoint?” Then, you might share a scripture that shows what God’s Word says on the subject. If you find that you cannot reach him or that he is unreasonable, do not insist that he accept what you have said. Rather, it is best to conclude with a friendly comment or two, thus preparing the way for a future opportunity to present the good news to him.—Prov. 12:8, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 When you start a conversation, try to make it a pleasant experience for the householder. Insofar as it depends upon you, try to leave him with a favorable impression, if possible, a more favorable attitude toward God, his Word and his servants than before you called. In this way even if you are not successful initially in reaching his heart, he may be more receptive the next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Deep concern and a loving desire to help interested ones are important factors contributing to successful and enjoyable field activity. Continue endeavoring to reach the hearts of those you contact, looking to Jehovah to bless your efforts.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Burma reported a new peak in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pub</span><span class="font8">lishers—903 for December. It was their fourth consecutive peak this service year. ♦ Egyptian authorities in Alexandria, Egypt, arrested 30 of Jehovah's Witnesses, including children, for having a home Bible discussion. They were accused of reviving a banned religion. Others were later arrested at their homes. Visiting tourists have also been arrested and departed for having Bible literature published by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Italy reached a new peak in publishers during the month of March, with 70,259 sharing in the preaching work. This is the first time they have gone over the 70,000 mark. The Memorial report also shows there is a fine potential for increase with 151,413 in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In a town in Ecuador, two congregations, with 250 publishers, had a total attendance Of 1,599 for the Memorial. Of these, 62 attended Memorial services conducted in a jail. A mon who was studying, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font8">not yet a Witness, was jailed. While in jail he began talking to fellow prisoners. As a result, 50 attended a Bible talk and 16 are now studying the Bible right there in jail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting Times &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">it is felt that it is best to have the public meeting and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> .study on a week-night, we want to be sure that the basis for our decision reflects our desire to give spiritual interests first place. What effect will this have on meeting attendance and field service? Is it a time when most of the interested persons could conveniently attend? (Phil. 2:4) When we plan our meetings, can we truly say that we are seeking first the Kingdom? (Matt. 6:33) As we continually “make sure of the more important things,” we are assured of Jehovah’s blessings. —Phil. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Therefore, when selecting meeting times, consider carefully what motivates your decision. Will they benefit those associated? Will they allow for good field service arrangements week after week for individuals and family groups? If so, this is a very good thing. If not, it would be good for the elders to consider the matter with the congregation so that spiritual rather than recreational interests will be given primary consideration. Then those in your congregation will rejoice in saying, “To the house of Jehovah let us go.”—Ps. 122:1.</span></p>

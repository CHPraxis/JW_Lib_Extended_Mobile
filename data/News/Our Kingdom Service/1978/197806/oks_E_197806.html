<p><span class="font1">You will be pleased to know that three years after beginning extensive remodeling work on the 15-story, 450-room former Towers Hotel, the work has been completed and the remodeled lobby and lounge were opened on April 15. When this building was purchased in January of 1975, many thought that it would care for our housing needs for many years to come, as it had room for some 1,000 people. However, due to the continued growth of the Brooklyn Bethel family, the building is now fully occupied.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">building has its own kitchen and dining rooms to care for those living there. Also located there are the sewing room, dry cleaning and shoe repair departments, a meeting hall for family programs, a library, a portion of the laundry and</span></p>

It is best to arrive sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. so that you will have time to complete your tour. There are no tours on Saturday afternoon or on Sunday. A tour of the Bethel home originating at the Towers lobby takes about one hour to complete. The factory tour, which begins at 117 Adams Street, takes nearly two hours? We also invite you to tour our shipping facilities located at 30 Columbia Heights. This tour takes about 20 minutes. No appointments are needed to take these tours, but if you have a group of more than 30 persons, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">were you first contacted with approach you with the good news? Or was it by the house-to-house preaching of one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? No doubt many of us would say, “By a Witness calling at my home.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Jesus, the apostles and early disciples all took the initiative in bringing the good news to people by going to their houses. (Matt. 24:14) And now, for over 50 years, Jehovah’s people have put forth •similar efforts. Due to their desire to reach all, they have spent hundreds of millions of hours visiting people in their homes. The fine results over the years testify to the wisdom of this method of preaching.—M att. 11:19.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Serving Jehovah is one of the greatest privileges anyone could have. The psalmist said that to him a day in God’s courtyards was better than a thousand elsewhere. (Ps. 84:10) Concerning the “great crowd,” Revelation 7:15 says: “That is why they are before the night in his temple.” Regarding Anna the prophetess, Luke 2:37 says that “she was a widow now eighty-four years old, who was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications.” Who else but Jehovah would we want to serve? Jesus said in reply to Satan’s effort to tempt him: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—Matt. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> So today we are rightly concerned about any of our brothers who stop serving Jehovah, even if they stop only for a short time. Are there some in your congregation who have become inactive in recent years? Are there some you</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">practice in this and other countries for persons not specifically invited</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">to go from home to home and knock on doors or ring doorbells. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Much of a person’s life is spent in or around his home. Would it not be true that at home a person may more readily listen to what you have to say since he is free from the distractions of business? In talking to individuals or family groups in the house-to-house work, we can often give more extensive personal assistance by answering their questions and objections. This opens the way for return visits and Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Did not Jesus say, “Make disciples of people of all the nations”? (Matt. 28:19) Our house-to-house witnessing not only shows we are obedient and have love for God and neighbor, but it also shows that our love is not partial, because we visit everyone in our area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Would you like to have more zeal for the service? Then try sharing regularly each month in the house-to-house work. Is it not true do not see at the meetings anymore? What are your thoughts toward them? Would you like to help them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT MIGHT YOU DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> This could be discussed by the elders at their June meeting. One elder, possibly the Secretary, could check the Publisher’s Record Card file and make a note of those who have become inactive or are in danger of becoming so. An elder might want to call on a certain publisher because of previous acquaintance and association with that one. Or, other publishers can be asked to help. Maybe you studied with one and would now welcome the opportunity to be of special assistance in this time of need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> What will you do? What will you say? It is probably best just to stop in for a short visit. Let them know they have been missed by you and by others. Show your genuine interest and concern. Without prying, try to learn why they have been absent and what they need. Let them know how others </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>

On paragraph one, In addition to discussing thoughts there expressed, can ask audience: &quot;What have you especially enjoyed about serving Jehovah over the years?” On paragraph four, in addition to discussing thoughts there expressed, can ask audience: “What other things do you believe can help inactive ones to begin serving again?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">25 </span><span class="font13">min: Become Imitators of God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font13">capable elder should be assigned this part, which will require a good deal of preparation. He should be ready with additional questions, and should be thoroughly acquainted beforehand with the application of the scriptures cited. To aid him with his advance preparation he can read his copy of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock/’</span><span class="font13"> pages 7-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah is an outstanding example for man in every aspect of life. (Eph. 5:1) . We will consider His example in these three areas: (1) Jehovah, the Grand Instructor. (2) Jehovah, the Great Evangellzer, supervisor of the worldwide preaching work. (3) Jehovah, a lover of justice and a God of mercy. Invite the audience to comment on how we can imitate Jehovah in these areas.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">(1) Jehovah, the Grand Instructor: Never has mankind been without direction from Jehovah. Instructions were given to Adam on the subduing of the earth. The prophets and priests of Israel continued to instruct Jehovah's people. (Neh. 8:7, 8) Jesus, too. was noted for his masterful way of teaching. (Matt. 7:28) However, Jesus himself said, “What I teach is not mine.” (John 7:16; 8:38) What provisions have been made by Jehovah for the schooling of his people today? What do we learn about Jehovah's teaching from Jesus?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(2) Jehovah, the Great Evangellzer: Jehovah provided good news for man when uttering the first prophecy In Genesis 3:15. It was prophesied that Jesus would “tell good news to the meek ones.” (Isa. 61:1) The good news (evangel) was to be “preached In all the inhabited earth.” (Matt. 24:14) Jehovah is responsible for the preaching work. (2 Tim. 4:17) If we find we are slacking off in our preaching work, what can we do? What should motivate us? Why should we take steps to improve ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(3) Jehovah loves justice and displays mercy: How were both justice and mercy displayed in Eden? Note Jehovah's perfect balance in these qualities. (Ex. 34:6. 7) The ransom provision is based on justice. (1 Tim. 2:6) How can we display these qualities in dealing with: (a) Those with a weak conscience? (b) Those who may have offended us? (c) Younger members of the congregation?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">In imitating Jehovah we have the finest example to follow In the universe. We share the desire of the psalmist to ‘worship and bow down before our Maker.'—Ps. 95:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">22 min: Family Bible Reading. The objective of this Bible reading and discussion is to consider events of Nisan 16. Jesus’ resurrection day, identifying particularly the five appearances of Jesus to his followers on that day. Have group of five to seven persons, members of a household that would fit the circumstances in your congregation. It could perhaps include parents, children and grandparents, or some other set of relatives or persons living together. Have different ones read the scriptures, but have one or two persons in the household obviously prepared and leading the discussion, helping others to see the sequence of events on Nisan 16, perhaps tilling in related details as the discussion progresses. (1) Appears to the women as they run to tell the apostles what the two angels at the tomb told them. (Matt. 28:1-10; Luke 24:4. 5) (2) To Mary Magdalene at the tomb, after Peter and John had left. (John 20:3-18) (3) To the two disciples walking to the village of Emmaus. (Luke 24:13-32) (4) When the two disciples returned to Jerusalem they learned from those gathered there that Jesus had meanwhile appeared to Peter. (Luke 24:33-35) (5) Finally, to all those met behind locked doors because of fear. (Luke 24:36-43) In conclusion encourage brothers regularly to include Bible reading In the family schedule. For example, it would be good to read beforehand the Scriptural accounts on which the dramas at this summer’s conventions will be based. Again refer the congregation to the information regarding this under Announcements.</span></p>

Jesus would not require something if it were not possible to do so. (Mark 12:30) (3) How does Jesus' illustration of the sower in Matthew 13 relate to the evangelizing work and the matter of being whole-souled? Was the one bearing thirtyfold not whole-souled? (4) Is it reasonable to conclude that as long as we are doing something in Jehovah's service we are whole-souled? Why is it dangerous to become complacent?

<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Some may feel that the house-to-house service is not being stressed so much because of the territories’ being so well covered. It is true that in many places the territories are worked regularly with the magazines and other literature. But have we contacted every individual possible whose heart and mind can be filled with Bible truth? Concerning a woman to whom Paul witnessed the record says, “Jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.”—Acts 16: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Many are the expressions of joy that have been made by those sharing in this method of witnessing. One brother says, “It is hard for me to get started in house-to-house work. Then when I get started I enjoy it so much I don’t want to stop.” Another publisher says, “I feel that this is what keeps me strong in the truth.” A pioneer sister remarks, “I just can’t wait to get into the field, for every house is like a surprise package. What will the people inside be like?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> “A devout man and one fearing God together with all his household.” Is that not a desirable situation? Does it describe your household as well? Interestingly, this is not a Christian household being spoken about. Yet it was one in which daily prayers were offered to God, and sincere efforts were made to serve the Most High. Thus God sent an angel who told this man to send for Peter in order to learn about salvation.—Acts 10:2; 11:13, 14.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Regarding a royal attendant, evidently of King Herod Antipas, the Bible says: “He and his whole household believed.” Of Lydia and those living with her, we are told: “She and her household got baptized.” Similarly, of a Philippian jailer the Bible says: “He and his were baptized without delay. . . . and he rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed God.”—John 4:53; Acts 16:15, 33, 34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">-<sup>4</sup> Does your household, too, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">believe?</span><span class="font1"> Are they convinced in mind and heart as to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font1"> identity of Jesus—that he is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actually</span><span class="font1"> God’s Son from heaven who gave his life in a sacrificial death here on earth so that we might gain eternal life? Of course, something needs to precede believing. What? Knowledge, for how can you really believe in something if you do not know about it? Are there provisions for your household to grow in knowledge of God? There really need to be.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> What are mealtimes like in your household? Some of us, in conversation recently, said that we remember so well our whole family gathering around the meal table together. These were good times of fellowship, and for us who were in the truth, it was a fine time for discussing and reviewing spiritual things. Mealtimes are such enjoyable and beneficial times at Bethel today. Is this true in your home? to thank the hundreds of brothers from around the country who volunteered to help with the remodeling work. Their hard work, the support of all of you, and the blessing of Jehovah have made all this possible.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">If not, could you arrange for them to be? This can play an important Eart in developing a truly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">believing </span><span class="font1">ousehold.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Note what one father who raised 18 children in the truth observed: “Eating together has definitely contributed toward our unity, affording us, for example, the opportunity to pray together. And it has enabled me to inculcate in my children the sayings of God ‘when sitting in my house,’ in harmony with His will that I do so. (Deut. 6:6, 7) It has also helped me to keep my finger on the pulse of the family, to observe attitudes or trends, and to apply whatever I perceived to be the remedy according to the spiritual needs of all of us.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font1">June 1, 1976.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Having family meals together may involve making some adjustments in schedules for the household, but it truly can be worth the effort or expense. A father who successfully raised three boys in the truth writes: “Although I was working more than fifteen miles (25 kilometers) away from home, I came back for lunch. I felt that the cost was more than outweighed by the advantages of a family meal. What a lot of problems were solved around the family table!”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> November 15, 1977.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>s</sup> Jesus, too, used mealtimes to discuss spiritual matters and apparently the disciples did too. (John 21:15-17; Acts 2:42, 46) But it is also good when other times can be set aside for Bible reading and discussion. Why not, for instance, take segments of the life of Jesus and read at one session portions of the Bible that relate only to that particular part of Jesus’ life. For example, many enjoyable sessions of Bible reading and discussion can revolve around just the few days between Nisan 8 to 16, 33 C.E.—See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aid,</span><span class="font1"> page 930.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> How is your household? This is a question that each of us should ask ourselves often, and then take whatever steps we can to make it one that is spiritually healthy. For really, what benefit is it if we gain the whole world, but our family dies spiritually?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Offering Subscriptions to Everyone</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup>For many years </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> have been vehicles for spiritual ,food and lifegiving instructions for millions throughout the world. Through these fine publications we have all been helped to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah. In their efforts to make these publications of even more value, the Governing Body is continually striving to improve them. Have you noticed these improvements? Many have commented on the outstanding articles that have appeared, and we can be confident that such consistent improvement will continue. Also, have you appreciated the lively and heartwarming illustrations that have appeared in recent issues?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Many have found that a personal subscription is helpful to them. Why? By having a personal subscription, they are assured of getting every issue, even if for some reason they are unable to get to the Kingdom Hall to pick up a supply for the field service. By having a personal subscription, many have found that they more often read the fine information contained in the magazines right away. Thus they not only benefit personally, but are better prepared to use the magazines in the preaching activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Some parents have found that their children take a greater interest in reading articles when they get a personal subscription with their name on it. Perhaps your family would benefit, too, from having a personal subscription for each member </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> the household.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> But besides ourselves and our </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them to Serve Again </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font1">in the congregation are and what they are doing. Are new ones associating since they last attended? Tell them about it. What is the latest news about the “Victorious Faith” International Convention? Talk about it and encourage them to be there if they have not yet made arrangements. Their attendance, in fact, would probably be</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">June 11: Pages 19 to 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">June 18: Pages 27 to 34</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">June 25: Pages 35 to 44 families, there are thousands of others who would benefit from a personal subscription. Surely none of us would want persons with whom we study to miss the article written that seems to be “just for them.” By their having a personal subscription, they will be assured of getting every issue, even though we ourselves may be away for a time. The same would apply to persons on whom we have made return visits in the past.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Certainly it is our desire to assist friends and relatives to know Jehovah and Jesus Christ. A fine way to do that might be to send a gift subscription to them. You no doubt, would like to contact them to let them know that they will be receiving the magazines. Or, if you would like the Society to send them a letter of explanation, simply write “Gift” at the top of the subscription blank, and print your name in the space provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Of course, we will be offering subscriptions to persons we meet in the door-to-door service as well. If the householder does not accept the offer of a subscription for a year, you may find that he will be pleased to have a subscription for six months, along with a book, just as readily as he would accept a book alone. Why not try offering a six-month subscription and a pocket-size book for $1.35?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> So, although our personal contact with people might be limited, the subscription arrangement provides a means by which millions can regularly receive life-giving instructions, like Jehovah’s provisions described in Revelation 22:2, “yielding their fruits each month.” the thing that would help them most at this point. Discuss the special day of field service arranged for Friday and how it is expected that a grand witness will be given in all convention cities. Ask if they would like to accompany you to the next meeting at the Kingdom Hall if you were to stop by to go with them. Do not give up if you do not succeed immediately.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> How does Jehovah feel about those who stray and need help? To the Israelites he said: “Return to me, and I will return to you.” (Mal. 3:7) Jesus gave the parable about a shepherd who left ninety-nine sheep to search for one that was lost. Recall the results? “And ii he happens to find it, I certainly</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ In one California congregation during March, over 45 percent of the 117 publishers reporting field service were auxiliary pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The brothers in Hong Kong continue to show fine zeal in field service, with another new peak of 724 publishers in March. Many share as auxiliary pioneers each month, and regular pioneers increase month by month.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Question feox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">• How thoroughly must the outlines provided in ”Your Service Meetings” be covered by those assigned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Those handling meeting parts may find that there is more material provided than they can cover in the time allowed, especially if they work in local application of the material, including experiences, and so on. On the other hand, very small congregations with few publishers to draw on for such material may appreciate having detailed outlines. Therefore, it is suggested that the brothers handling, meeting parts tailor them to the local circumstances, using the main points within each part that are applicable locally and illustrating them to the extent possible. This may mean that some of the lesser points will be eliminated to allow for thorough coverage of the main points, much as a public speaker cuts out subpoints if his talk is going overtime. However, this does not mean that the discussion should divert from the basic purpose of the meeting part as outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Scriptural discussions outlined, from time to time may have more material and scriptures provided than can be covered properly when personal experiences are worked in. The one handling the part will do well to allow for this by noting ahead which scriptures or points are most important and using others only as time permits. It is better to cover a few points </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">with application</span><span class="font13"> to our lives, than to cover many points that are too general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This is not to say that preparation for service meeting parts is not essential. Each one assigned is expected seriously to prepare his presentation, having in mind his responsibility to serve his brothers well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed.”—Matt. 18:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> While the elders will organize matters so that as much as possible can be accomplished, do not think that this in any way prohibits you from taking the initiative and offering help on your own. Not at all! All of us are obligated personally to encourage and help whenever we see a need. (Gal. 6:10) You might well be able to accomplish more than anyone else because of your previous acquaintance with the person, or because of your knowledge of a certain situation. “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it.”—Prov. 3:27.</span></p>

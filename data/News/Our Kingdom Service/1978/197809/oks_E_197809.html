<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 1978</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 21, No. 9 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>kingdom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">At the “Victorious Faith” International Convention, we were delighted to receive still another provision designed to increase the understanding and spread of the Kingdom message. In the past, many have inquired about recorded Bible readings from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Neto World Translation.</span><span class="font13"> We were pleased to learn that cassette tape recordings of the Gospel of John have been produced and are now available for our use. Why was John’s Gospel selected? It is filled with the comforting words of Jesus that warm the heart and prompt us to draw closer to Jehovah. It is understandable that this is the most widely distributed portion of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How can these recordings be used? AU of us are sure to enjoy and benefit from hearing God’s Word read with force and meaning. Those confined to a sickbed or who are in a hospital will especially appreciate them. Blind persons, as well as those with limited reading ability, will be able to put them to good use. Undoubtedly you will find that they can be used with good results in a variety of other situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Bear in mind that these tapes are copyrighted. Any commercial or profit-making duplication or distribution would be an infringement of the copyright. This would not necessarily apply to making a copy for personal use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Cassette recordings of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Good News According to John</span><span class="font13"> should be ordered through the congregation. Special order blanks have been sent to each congregation with the August statement. Please do not send any remittance with the order. The recordings will be charged to your congregation’s literature account. The price is $3.00 per set. For pioneers, the rate is $2.50. Use this means to build appreciation for the Bible,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We send our Christian love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Always Have Plenty to Do in the Work of the Lord’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> AH of us have plenty to do every day. Each day we are confronted with many responsibilities, all vying for our time. The demands of the family and secular jobs may be enough to keep us occupied. Added to that we would like to reach out for a full share in the activities of the congregation, including meetings, personal study and participation in the disciple-making work. Sometimes we may get discouraged, feeling we are unable to do justice to each responsibility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But, having a very busy schedule is not something new for God’s servants. The apostle Paul implied that he had a very busy schedule when he spoke of anxiety for the congregations that “rushes in on me from day to day.” </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(2 Cor.</span><span class="font13"> 11: 28) Yet he always viewed things positively, discerning with appreciation the underlying benefits. That appreciation moved him to admonish his brothers 'always to have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.’—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup>It is also good for us to view things in a positive way. Being kept busy in Kingdom activity serves as a protection. There is danger in being “unoccupied.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Those &quot;Acquiring</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Regarding ministerial servants, Paul wrote: “For the men who minister in a fine manner </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font13"> acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.” (1 Tim. 3:13) The apostle was thus ■ explaining, not a prerequisite for being a ministerial servant, but the benefits when such a brother does minister or carry out his duties in a fine manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The Bible sets high standards for a ministerial servant. (1 Tim. 3:8-10, 12) Brothers recommended should clearly be meeting these. Becoming a ministerial servant is no routine thing; it is not as if almost every adult, baptized male should have the position as a sort ■ of titleholder. Ministerial servants should be exemplary, spiritual men.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>;i</sup> Acts 6:1-6 illustrates what should be true of such men. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(ad </span><span class="font13">pp. 1162, 1163) So as to concentrate on the Word, the apostles needed assistance in caring for duties that were </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">important,</span><span class="font13"> but that could be handled by other qualified men. They selected men (1 Tim. 5:13) Idleness is a fertile ground for the seeds of complaint and complacency. We are urged to keep our “minds on maintaining fine works.” (Titus 3:8) Individuals busily engaged in worthwhile activities rarely have time to pursue worthless things, harbor resentment, worry about their mistakes, or get involved in wrong conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* Having plenty to do also protects the congregation. At times, individuals whose motives are not good will associate with the Christian congregation. But anyone who is insincere or has a wrong motive will not tarry long where there is much good work to be done. This safeguards the congregation, helping to assure that those within are wholehearted. It also helps us individually to grow stronger spiritually by exercising and developing our thinking abilities and powers of reason.—Heb. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">s Always having plenty to do teaches us some vital lessons. Assignments to aid others remind us to think of them and their needs ahead of our own. A willingness to accept responsibility and follow </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>a Fine Standing'</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">“full of spirit and wisdom.” Hence, they would be worthy of the congregation’s confidence. Their selection was not just to take care of some menial task or to encourage them; it was a privilege by means of which they could work hard in serving the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Ministerial servants today help to care for many necessary duties involving the Kingdom Hall, distribution of supplies, and assisting elders with record keeping and accounts. In this way they work in behalf of their brothers and sisters. If they appreciate that this is what they are doing, they will be conscientious in fulfilling their responsibilities. Rather than being casual about showing up to. care for assigned duties, they will be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">dependable</span><span class="font13"> week after week. In fact, if something beyond their control interferes with their being on time or handling their assignment, men of their spiritual stature can be counted on to make alternate arrangements. They will be concerned that the congregation is not left in the lurch. The congre-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

Questions should be directed toward parents and older ones, asking them kindly to explain why certain counsel is fiven. Try to help young people look eyond rules and appreciate why It Is wise for them to listen. Strive to be positive, helpful; avoid being critical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman: Some young people become resentful toward parents, teachers and others in authority, feeling that they are restricted in many areas without good reason. Result: resistance to counsel and a communication gap. How can we help them understand why guidelines are established to regulate their conduct? How would you answer these questions ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1) It is common to see use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs at schools and other places. Why are parents so concerned when thev hear about such things? (2 Cor. 7:1; Prov. 23:20, 21) (2) Young people have a need for retv Teation. Why are they advised to avoid many forms of entertainment and sports? (1 Tim. 4:8; Phil. 4:8) (3) Music and dancing have been a part of every culture all the way back to Bible times. Why so much apprehension about what is popular now?

(1 Cor. 15: 33: Prov. 13:20) (5) Why do you encourage them to have a full share in the activities of the congregation and consider the possibility of taking up the pioneer service?—Eccl. 12:1; 1 Tim. 6:18, 19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">20 min: &quot;Those 'Acquiring a Fine Standing.' &quot;&nbsp;A group of ministerial servants on platform discuss this article with an elder. Each one expresses appreciation for having plenty to do and comments on how they as a group can be of greater service to their brothers. Song 7 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Imitate the “God of All Comfort.”—2 Cor. 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Song </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">34. </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. Talk on Jehovah’s being a &quot;God of all comfort.” (2 Cor. 1:3) Creation shows he is concerned about well-being of all persons. Also, record of his dealings provides comfort, assuring us that we are not alone or without hope. (Rom. 15:4, 5) Jesus promised comfort to those mourning over wickedness of present system and who acknowledge own sinfulness and seek forgiveness. (Matt. 5:4) Will we Imitate Jehovah by comforting others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">28 mln: “Keep Comforting One Another.” Audience discussion. Al) of us can be a comfort to one another. Paul comforted his brothers, aiding them to be faithful. (1 Thess. 2:11, 12) We should do likewise. (1 Thess. 5:11) What would you say or do in these cases ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1) Sister’s unbelieving husband makes it hard for her to get to meetings or to share in field service. (2) Young person is discouraged over being different from schoolmates. (3) Older Witness has less strength and often Is ill. (Heb. 6:10) (4) Brother has become downhearted after being counseled. (Heb. 12:5, 11) (5) Brother is disheartened by pressure on job to ignore his conscience. (Heb. 13:5, 6, 18) (6) Single or widowed person would like to marry but unable to find suitable Christian mate.—1 Cor. 7:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When we see such situations, are we genuinely concerned? When was the last time we sought to comfort and upbuild family member or fellow Witness needing consolation or encouragement? Good to imitate Jehovah in doing so.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font11"> Cor. 1:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Comforting Others Brings Fine Results. Talk, with audience comments and perhaps interviews. Christians do not comfort only other Witnesses. Proclaiming good news Includes sharing comforting message, as did Jesus. (Isa. 61:2; Luke 4:16-21) Have not many householders mentioned to you troubles or problems thev have or their grief over the decline of morals? Here are opportunities to comfort from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What would you do if householder says that family member recently died? Need to be discerning and tactful. Some comforting Bible verses may open the way for a further witness later. (John 11:19, 31) Any experiences of this type? What did you say? What was the response ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Interview some in congregation, or invite audience- to relate experiences: (1) How they may have responded to truth because of being given comfort, or how they were aided to make progress by comforting encouragement received. (2) Joy they have had in comforting others (Witnesses or not) and beneficial result of doing so. Song 40 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Do I Appreciate What Jehovah Is Doing for Me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 31. Local announcements. Talk. Thoughtful Christians realize that we benefit from what God has done for all mankind. We have life from him. (Acts 17:26-28) He provided earth with much that makes living possible and enjoyable, (Ip pp. 10-22) But what about the many things he does for us </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">personally f</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">God's Special Provisions for You. Discussion. Invite audience to comment on and to relate personal experiences regarding: (1) How each of the following is something special that God has done for us. (2) How we can benefit the most from what he Is doing.</span></p>

(3) Elders as “gifts in men.” (4) Training for more effectiveness and pleasure in field service. (5) Brothers and sisters who will help it we have difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Appreciation for what God has done aids us to avoid becoming critical, uncooperative or complacent and it draws us closer to him.—Ps. 92:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Jehovah Helps Us to Develop New Personalities. Interviews. By his spirit and Word. God helps us to change to new personality. (Eph. 4:22-24) We sense need for more progress, yet we probably recognize that we already have come a long way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Interview some who formerly had old personality traits such as bad temper, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tendency to jealousy,</span><span class="font11"> being withdrawn, or too pushy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Enjoying Organized Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup>A Bible principle that should mean much to a book study group and its conductor is that stated at 1 Corinthians 14:40: “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.” This principle, when applied, makes for joyful, productive service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As publishers, we appreciate it when the conductor follows this principle. One thing the group will need is territory. So the conductor should plan in advance how the territory can best be worked. Will there be enough for the group? If territory is not nearby, could the group meet earlier or even in the territory? Will safety require publishers to work in groups or i pairs? Dividing up the assignment can be done “by arrangement” with brothers assisting in taking groups to different parts of the territory. In this way, the publishers will not create a scene by congregating on a street corner. The conductor wants things to be done “decently.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Does your book study group organize for service right after the Sunday meetings or meet again later? Or do you meet at the book study location either Sunday morning or afternoon? These are arrangements that can be worked out locally, but it is important for all to know clearly what the arrangements are.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Another thing that can contribute to effective, organized service is when the conductor arranges to work with us from door to door. As we observe how he handles matters at the door or on a return visit, possibly we can see ways to improve our own service. We appreciate his suggestions and observations. And do not words of commendation move us to greater zeal? By making appointments in advance and working with even one or two each week, he may be able to work with all in the group during a period of a few months. He can be alert, too, to enlist the help of his assistant and others, perhaps aiding them to make appointments to assist others. He must be a good organizer, because “when there is no skillful direction, the people fall.”—Prov. 11:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Are you personally supporting the arrangements in your group? If we wait until Saturday or Sunday morning to make our decision about field service, might the Adversary help influence our decision? Sticking to a regular schedule for service will let “things take place decently and by arrangement.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When you reach the first house in the territory, are you really</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">ready to knock on the door? Have you organized things? What about your book bag? Are Bible, books and magazines arranged neatly? Do you have a pencil? Subscription slips? Do you keep a House-to-House Record so you can call back on interested ones? Thoughtful organization will contribute to a more productive and joyful day in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah has foreseen the needs of the people of this generation. Their greatest need is to have the truth. He has given us the privilege of declaring his truths to mankind. Our enjoyment and effectiveness in doing this will be greatly increased by organized service in our book study groups, doing everything “decently and by arrangement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention News</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “Victorious Faith” International Conventions got off to a good start in June with a total attendance of 600,489 for the public lecture at 14 conventions. There were 3.856 baptized. At Montreal, in Canada, July 5-9, the peak attendance was 80,008, and 831 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The convention program was enthusiastically received. The overall spiritual provision has been described as “most faith strengthening.” Many expressed appreciation for the way field service was stressed. “It is a call to action.” observed one brother. Another remarked: &quot;It has really gotten to the hearts of the brothers, we will see . . . a more serious view of service—and this is the time for it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On Friday morning thousands shared in field activity, using the special kits, which attracted much attention. One report said: “People knew Jehovah’s Witnesses were in town.” It was exciting to participate in the well-organized campaign. Kingdom publishers appeared like a swarm of locusts as they covered residential territory, did street work and called on persons in offices and stores. In several places, news reporters accompanied brothers in the door-to-door activity, and they wrote interesting reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And what about the conduct of the conventioners? Time and again brothers were impressed with the attentiveness of the audiences, the way families stayed together and the fine behavior of children. Compared with past' assemblies, fewer persons worked during sessions and there was less milling around. All this contributed toward the orderliness of the conventions. &quot;One thing that imnressed me,” an elder said, “was the lack of movement and restless running around. Everybody was sitting and listening. It was a real joy to be there and concentrate on the outstanding program.” Outsiders, including hotel managers and stadium personnel, commented on the orderly way conventioners conducted themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So many reports being received tell about the benefits resulting from applying the counsel and reminders given prior to the conventions. Surelv, this pleases Jehovah. This is evident'by the outpouring of his rich blessings. May we all continue to ‘maintain our conduct fine among the nations,’ as we now press ahead with the same spirit in the field service as was shown at the international conventions.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By Being a Good Listener</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* In the July issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font13"> the importance of developing conversations with householders was considered. We hope that you have tried some of the suggestions offered, with good results. In doing so, very likely you have come to appreciate the need to be a good listener.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> A willingness to listen is an evidence of sincere interest. People respond to that. Hence, it is good to be “swift about hearing.” (Jas. 1:19) Listening carefully helps us to know what to say and how to say it. Our interest in what is said can prompt a householder to say more, giving further opportunity to witness more effectively.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Listening means more than just hearing with our ears. It means paying attention with a genuine interest in the welfare of the speaker. It calls for a display of unselfishness, kindness, patience and self-control. (Gal. 5:22, 23) Besides the words, note the tone of voice. Is the speaker happy or depressed, pleased or angry, proud or humble?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Many householders are somewhat reserved or skeptical when we try to converse with them at the door. Use of tactful, friendly questions is one of the best means to encourage them to express themselves. When they comment, always look for points of agreement and try to build on that rather than taking exception, to some wrong view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes we are prone to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">'Acquiring a Fine Standing' </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont d) </span><span class="font13">gation respects and treasures such brothers.—Luke 16:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Other avenues to serve may also open up. Though the elders have the primary responsibility to do “speaking and teaching,” ministerial servants with ability may be assigned instruction talks or parts on the service meeting. (1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2) They may even be asked to give part or all of a public talk. Their advancement can be greater if they will approach an eider who is experienced or gifted as a teacher and seek suggestions, or perhaps ask for counsel after giving a talk. Often they will be asked to read </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> or perhaps, to conduct a book study where circumstances require it. Of course, conscientious preparation should be put into such assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>0</sup> Because he is to be a spiritalk too much and to “preach” to people. Even if we ask questions, the tendency is not to listen to the reply when we have a prepared presentation in mind. Subconsciously we may be afraid that if we stop, the householder will lose interest and turn away. Have you felt that way? It is good to remember that a warm conversation is far more appealing than a cut-and-dried &quot;sermon,”—Eccl. 3:7,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Being a good listener is a help in making return visits and conducting Bible studies. People like to be treated with respect and given personal attention. When they comment we can ask ourselves: Does he really understand? Is he using good reasoning? Does he grasp what the Bible says and believe it? What you are able to learn as a careful listener may determine your success as a teacher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Due to increasing pressures of this generation, interested persons are often burdened with many problems. They become depressed and need encouragement. A listening ear sometimes does wonders for another’s spirit. While we must be careful not to pry into their personal affairs, or make decisions for them, we can show ourselves to be a true friend who wants to help.—Prov. 18:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> So, to be a good teacher, one must be a good listener. We can appreciate why Jesus advised his disciples to “pay attention to how you listen.” (Luke 8:18) If we listen, others may listen to us and save their lives.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">tual'example, a ministerial servant should have as great a share in the field service as his circumstances reasonably allow. He knows that thereby he is pleasing and praising Jehovah. It will also be a stimulus to those working with him. He can provide them with much fine training. They will know that he is not someone who merely handles details, but is an exemplary servant of Jehovah in all respects.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> It is easy to see, then, why Paul said of such men that they “are acquiring ... a fine standing.” This is not, as some suggest, an advancement in a church hierarchy. Rather, ministerial servants who “minister in a fine manner” are assured of a blessing from Jehovah and Jesus, and they have the respect and support of the whole congregation. Rightfully they acquire “great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">'Always Have Plenty to t&gt;o‘ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font13">direction helps us to learn the meaning of humility. Working side by side with others provides valuable lessons in patience and brotherly love. Sticking with a job to its completion teaches us to be faithful and to appreciate the value of endurance, as well as reminds us that we must exert ourselves &quot;vigorously” if we are to merit Jehovah’s blessing.—Luke 13:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Keeping up with all that is expected of us means that we will have to keep “working hard and exerting ourselves.” (1 Tim. 4:10) Nevertheless, there is a great reward in the knowledge that God is well pleased with such efforts. Always having plenty to do in Jehovah’s service can help us to be counted among the faithful servants who “will get many blessings.”—Prov. 28:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 1978</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 21, No. 3 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Uvingdom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Truly all of us have reason to rejoice because of having come to a knowledge of the truth. Since true worship brings great joy, you may have been surprised to learn that, despite the fact that nearly 28,000 were baptized in the United States during the 1977 service year, a monthly average of 14,270 fewer persons reported having shared in field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This may well have given you reason for concern, and we share that concern. Doubtless a number of factors are responsible. Some may have been caught up in the whirl of materialistic living or in mxieties of life. Old age or infirmity may have affected how much some individuals can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, we need to examine ourselves. Do we have the same love for the truth that we did at first? (Rev. 2:4) Jesus Christ stated: ‘Out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks.’ (Luke 6:45) So, might it be that some of us have neglected regular reading of and meditation on God’s Word? Those of us who are elders especially need to consider whether we have set a fine example in public witnessing and whether good field service arrangements exist in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, there are some encouraging signs. Magazine placements, subscriptions and return visits were higher in November 1977 as compared with the same month the year before. Bible studies are also starting to increase again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is much work to do. Our commission to make disciples has not changed. (Matt. 28:19, 20) The Grand Evangelizer is still sponsoring' the preaching of the “good news” and it is our privilege and joy to work with him in this, to his honor and for the blessing of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your brothers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Ready for Memorial</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Why will you attend the Memorial this year? Surely one reason would be to show appreciation to Jehovah for providing his Son as our Ransomer. It is a happy time, one of rejoicing, for the occasion reminds us that Jesus “conquered the world,” by keeping his integrity right to the death. (John 16:33) Our appreciation for the love that has been shown to us should move each of us to be in attendance and to help others to be there on Thursday night, March 23, after sundown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Did you know that last year, in the United States alone, the Memorial attendance exceeded by 720,705 the number of publishers sharing in service during the same month? Will all of these and more attend this year? It depends much, does it not, on what we do to make the occasion widely known and personally help persons to be there? Perhaps for a week or two before Memorial we can use our service time to concentrate on inviting friends and interested people to attend. We may wish to use the telephone to reach those we cannot visit personally, or we might send an invitation through the mail. Perhaps we can even arrange to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Goals Are Helpful</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Is it not a good feeling to have the sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully achieving a goal? When we use goals in a reasonable manner in our field service and other areas of life, much can be accomplished to the glory of our heavenly Father.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> There are various aspects of our lives that can be improved by our use of goals. Many desire to accomplish more in personal study, making it their aim to read through the Bible by a certain time, or setting aside a certain time each week for personal study and then not letting other things get in the way. Others may be concerned that they are not absorbing as much of what they study as they would like. So that the material you study will be more easily remembered, why not make it your purpose to use it in some way in the field service or in discussions with others? Setting the objective to improve in speaking ability has helped many become effective public speakers. The Theocratic School is very helpful in this regard. For those who do not read as well as they desire, pick them up and bring them to this most sacred occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Although we want to give due attention to the cleanness and repair of the Kingdom Hall for this event, it is most important to be concerned with the talk itself. Hence, the speaker will want to give special attention to his material so that the talk will be understandable even for new ones. He should also strive to build up the faith of all in attendance. When the time comes for the Memorial, each of us can help by warmly welcoming newcomers and making all feel at home so that they will want to come again. Discussing together the significance of the Memorial will help remind us of the need to show love toward one another and others.—John 13:34, 35; 1 Thess. 3:12, 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL PUBLIC TALK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> It is appropriate and timely that our special talk on March 26 deals with the subject “The True Religion—How to Identify It.” Those who are with us for Memorial can be enthusiastically encouraged to come again and learn from the talk why Jehovah’s Wit-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font0">a number of congregations have reading classes that can put them on the right road for improvement.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> We would all like to continue improving in the application of the fruitage of the spirit in our lives. One way to accomplish this is to make an honest evaluation of ourselves to see in what areas we may be lacking and then try to improve in those aspects to a reasonable degree. For example, at times we may not have as much self-control as we would like. We may need to show a little more patience or long-suffering. If so, we can work on that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> In the area of field service, some have found that they are spending a reasonable amount of time but are not getting the results they wish, or find it difficult to get people interested in what they are saying. Likely we could accomplish more by making it our aim to get into Bible discussions with people. We can accomplish this by deciding in advance what subjects are generally of interest to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 52. Announcements. Talk on the subject How Are Our Brothers Doing? with some highlights from the introductory material of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1978 Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> pages 3-32. (Pick out points that would be of Interest to your congregation. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">“Presenting the Good News ’—Using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion.” </span><span class="font11">Chairman introduces part using Romans 10:15, explaining offer for month and service arrangements. During March we will again be offering two 384- or 416-page books with a pocket-size book for 60 cents. Publishers may want to highlight the Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of God, “Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font11"> book using Psalm 119:105 as a basis for the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publishers demonstrate offer using the Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of God</span><span class="font11"> book. After introducing yourself you could say: &quot;Many people today believe that the Bible is practical for our day but others do not. If the Bible is really the Word of God. then we would expect it to be the most practical book in the world, would we not? [Allow for response.] Psalm 119: 105 shows the Bible to be God's guide for mankind. [Read.] The Bible does give us guiding principles for handling major and minor problems of life. [Refer to subheadings in Chap. 11 of book.] This publication discusses these principles and their benefits. We are offering this book along with these other two books [name them], which show the Importance of God's Word in our lives.” A different book might be featured if more practical locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discuss Presenting the Good News with audience. Encourage use of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font11"> in the field. Explain how publishers can develop interest for return visits using method from Presenting the Good News. (May use example given or a subject that applies better locally.) Explain advantage for publisher to conclude original call by arousing Interest for a question to be answered on the next visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">“Personal Goals Are Helpful.” Audience discussion. Have some prepared to comment on how they have used goals beneficially. Song 106 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 5 </span><span class="font11">Theme: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.” (Ps. 119:105)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 20. Announcements. Discussion led by Theocratic School overseer of next week's Bible reading (Judg. 13-16) and how to get the most out of it. Find examples of points in the Bible reading that require some extra research to understand, and demonstrate how this research can be done. May wish to have audience read a portion of material and thereafter questions can be raised to see If brothers really got the sense of it or not. The point should be made that weekly Bible reading is a rewarding experience and also a challenge If the material is to be fully understood. It can be done regularly by setting aside just a few minutes each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Could our family study be more of a Bible study? (This is just one oi many ways In which a family may study together.) Arrange for family to read and discuss a chapter from the Bible dealing directly with a family situation. For example, Acts 5:1-11 on honesty, Daniel 3 on neutrality, Genesis 42-45 on forgiveness, 1 Kings 18 on faith in Jehovah's power, Acts 17:2-4, 16-34 on field service activity, and so forth. Each one, including children, can read a portion. A second portion might be acted out if time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Scriptural discussion with congregation led by an elder on why Bible reading is an essential part of true worship and should take priority over other reading that we do. As time permits, discuss Matthew 4:4, Psalm </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1, </span><span class="font11">Joshua 1:1-8 and Deuteronomy 17:18-20. (Here you could give examples of kings who did and who did not follow this advice and the results. For example, Josiah in 2 Kings 22:3-13, as contrasted with Jehoiakim in Jeremiah 36.) Song 119 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH </span><span class="font11">12 15 min: Song 114, Announcements. Accounts Report. Discussion of “International Convention‘Rooming Information.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font11">Scriptural discussion with audience entitled, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font11">Destiny Is Not Fixed. Stress Romans 2:4-6, which shows that ‘the kindly quality of God Is trying to lead all to repentance,' something not possible If our destiny were fixed or predetermined. (Discussion based on Ai(Z book material, “Foreknowledge, Foreordination,” to be handled by an elder.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following questions are raised to be answered in Scriptural discussion. Try to apportion the time so that there will be some discussion of each question using only the most outstanding scripture or scriptures to do so. (r) How does Jehovah's kindly quality hold out wonderful prospects for all people? (Rom. 2:7, 10; 1 John 5:13, 20: Gen. 18:23-26; Neh. 9:31) (2) What factors should be considered to understand God’s foreknowledge and whether one’s destiny is predetermined? (Aid, p. 594, Uli to p. 595, 112; Isa. 48:3-7; Gen. 2:16, 17) (3) Why is it not reasonable to believe that Jehovah foreknew the rebellion of Satan, Adam and Eve ? (Aid, p. 595, 1F7, 8; Gen. 6:5, 6; 18:20, 21; 22:11, 12) (4) How is the prospect of everlasting life presented in God’s Word? (Aid, p. 596, fl2-5; Matt. 7:7-11; 2 Pet. 3:9, 13) (5) Are persons in our territory foreknown to oecome either sheep or goats or does each one have a choice? (Deut. 30:19, 20; Rom. 2:4-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman concludes, helping audience to reason on the following points: God’s kindly quality, his genuine desire to see all persons gain salvation, should move us to serve him fully from the heart. It should move us to preach and teach with determination, knowing all others have genuine opportunity to “take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:17) Even those entrenched in false religion, weighed down with wrong attitudes and practices, rather than being predestined to be goats, have opened to them the opportunity to benefit from God’s kindly quality that is trying to lead them to repentance. Let us keep on preaching as Jehovah’s kindly quality motivates us to do our best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Getting Ready for Memorial.&quot; A lively discussion of the importance of the Memorial. Explain the congregational arrangements for the Memorial and have a demonstration inviting an interested person to attend the Memorial and public talk. Song 47 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 93. Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Talk and audience discussion showing that communication with our brothers is important. Elder gives talk on following material and has audience discussion on questions listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min:) As Jehovah’s servants we recognize the need for clear and loving communication with one another. When communication between family members, relatives, fellow servants or friends is lacking, much anxiety is experienced. On the other hand, when we cultivate the fruitage of the spirit, we find communication much easier and life more enjoyable. Counsel of the Scriptures is that there should be no “class distinctions” among brothers. (Jas. 2:1-9) Do you give your brothers reason to shy away from approaching you? Have you separated yourself from some in the congregation? (Prov. 18:1) If you feel a lack of love In the congregation, do you yourself show love? If we find that we have difficulty communicating with others, is it not better to conduct a selfexamination first, before placing the blame upon others? If. upon making such an examination we find that we are in any way lacking, what can we do to make Improvement? One thing is to examine the Scriptures on the subject and frankly apply to ourselves the counsel that especially fits us. (Mark 11:25; Col. 3:13; Prov. 6:20-22; Rom. 14:19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(15 mln:) Draw out comments from audience on the following questions highlighting the theme that we should be willing to listen with an open mind to what our brothers have to say. In the same manner, we would like to have our brothers listen to us when we try to communicate with them. 1. How can our reactions to suggestions or points of counsel cause a lack of communication between brothers? What suggestions could be given to improve communication in these areas? (Jas. 1:19, 20; Eph. 4:26; Prov. 15:1, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font11"> 4) 2. How can the following scriptures help publishers improve communication with other members of the congregation when personality problems arise? (Prov. 17:9; Eccl. 7:8, 9; Matt. 7:12; 5:23, 24; 1 John 4:20, 21) 3. When elders are willing to accept suggestions from others in the congregation, how can this be mutually beneficial? (Prov. 15:31: Rom. 12:16; Ezek. 24:16a) 4. When fellow elders communicate freely regarding matters pertaining to physical and spiritual needs of the congregation, how does this keep the flock strong? (1 Cor. 12:25, 26; Ps. 146:7-9) Conclude with Romans 8:28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• The Society Is arranging for a limited number of regular pioneers to serve temporarily as special pioneers in isolated territory for a two- or three-month period. There are about 35 assignments and each is organized for a team of two. The requirement will be 140 hours each month in field service. Some financial assistance will be provided. Before writing to the Society, arrangements should be made for a partner (give partner's name when writing) and the elders should sign the letter indicating that they believe the individuals would do well in this work. Please also specify whether or not you will be willing to work with a congregation that needs assistance in covering its territory. (No financial assistance is given for this.) Also, a car that is in good condition will be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Portuguese-speaking publishers who are in a position to serve where the need is greater in the Portuguese-speaking areas of the northeastern United States, particularly in Massachusetts and in California, may write the Society for details and supply the information requested on pages 134 and 135 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• In September, 1977, the Society mailed a year's supply of forms to all congregations. The increase in postal rates has made it very expensive for the Society to provide congregations with forms. Therefore, please use your remaining supplies judiciously. Publishers should be careful not to take more forms, such as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription slips, than can be used properly in field service. Neither should forms be used for notepaper or any purpose other than intended by the Society. When two or more congregations share a counter where forms are provided for publishers' use, it would be proper to maintain a common stock for the use of all publishers. This new arrangement for supplying congregations with forms will prove beneficial to the Society and all congregations.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">It is a pleasure to advise you that rooming departments in each 1978 international convention city are now open for handling room requests. The Society mailed out new Room Request forms to all congregations during February so that all who wish to write for rooms, whether hotel, motel or private home, may begin doing so. Elders should please discard all Room Request forms from previous years that may be left over at their Kingdom Halls, because the new form has been revised. A completely new system will be used in making rooming assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will note on the new forms that the congregation Secretary or the congregation’s “Convention Coordinator” is required to check each form turned in for accuracy, neatness and so forth, and sign it, showing his approval, before sending it in to the convention Rooming Department for the convention requested. Therefore, anyone filling out a Room Request form should </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> mail it to the convention city himself, but should turn it in to the designated elder in the congregation to verify the request. The elder can then send it in to the convention city along with any other Room Request forms he may have for that same city, using the rooming address for that city that is printed on the back of each Room Request form. Each congregation’s body of elders should determine immediately whether the Secretary or the “Convention Coordinator” will be used to verify the Room Request forms and then announce this to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rooming work for obtaining private home accommodations from publishers, interested ones and the public began in each convention city in February.

<p><span class="font0">In most convention cities the Society, through the convention organization, already has reserved a j number of hotel and motel rooms i in order to obtain much lower i rates than would have been available to individuals making their own arrangements. Therefore, it would be to your advantage in most cases to send in a Room • Request form as outlined above to ' the Rooming Department in the I city of your choice rather than obtaining the accommodations on your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This information will assist you in making your rooming arrangements in the near future. Other pertinent convention matters will be taken up in coming articles as convention time approaches.</span></p>

Since beliefs vary so much, how do you think we can Identify which religion is teaching the truth of the Bible? [Allow for comment.] God wants his people to worship him In the true way. [Read John 4:23, 24.] There are many ways the true religion can be identified. One is found in John 13:35.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “How comely are the feet those who declare good news good things!” (Rom. 10:15) These words of encouragement have spurred many Christians on to spread precious words of truth throughout the world. The new publication </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font0"> can be a valuable aid to us in accomplishing this work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Two of the things that make a successful return visit are a sincere personal interest in the one being called on and an appealing Bible subject to discuss. There are many appealing subjects outlined in this new publication. If it is kept in one’s Bible, it is readily available for use. Before making a return visit you could easily refer to it to gather some of the scriptures you could use on a chosen subject. Also, if a householder brings up an unexpected subject, it can be referred to by glancing at the list of subjects, which directs you to the proper page.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> For example: If you place the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font0"> using Psalm 119:105 as , a basis for the discussion, you may find it convenient to enlarge on the discussion by referring to scriptures from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font0"> under the heading on page three, “Bible,” Topic “C,” “Is a practical guide for our day.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> To prepare the householder for the next visit you might want to conclude the discussion by saying: “So we have learned that the Bible </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font0"> a practical guide for our dav. One of the things this guide tells us is that, in the near future, all governments of men will be replaced by the rule of God’s kingdom.” (Then a scripture taken</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Ready for Memorial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font0">nesses are different from other religions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Actions can speak even louder than words, so we will want to display Christ-like qualities at all times, but especially when dealing with the new ones. Our friendliness and warmth at the special public talk can make others feel the way one woman recently expressed it, “I have never gone to any religious meeting in my life where I felt so welcome.” She went on to describe the thoughtfulness shown to her by “total strangers” and looked forward to attending other meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Surely we will be busy during from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion </span><span class="font0">on page 16 under the subject “Kingdom,” Topic “B,” might be read, such as Matthew 6:9, 10; Daniel 2:44; or Revelation 21:2-4.) Then you can explain, “The next time I call I would like to discuss a little more with you as to just what this kingdom is and how it will affect each one of us.” Now the householder’s appetite is whetted for more information.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>s</sup> Then on the next visit you may wish to read or refer to the same scripture about the Kingdom again to refresh their memory and then continue with the discussion of that topic. Be sure to mark in your record which topic you have arranged to discuss with the person. Most have found that when using this method it is best to call back soon while the discussion is fresh in their mind. Toward the end of this call you might? find it appropriate to offer a regular Bible discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> For calls on those who object to the use of Bible literature, such as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font0"> book, in connection with a Bible study, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font0"> can be very helpful. Since the booklet consists only of scripture references, likely the individual would not object to its use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> If you find it difficult to learn to use this method of teaching, why not ask someone who has had success in getting into discussions if you could go along with them and perhaps even take part in a return visit where this method is used. They may be able to give you some helpful suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> With the goal of improving the quality of your teaching through Bible discussions, use </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font0"> as an aid in reaching the hearts of the people in your territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">the Memorial season. But what joy we have to follow in the footsteps of our leader Christ Jesus, preaching and making disciples as he did. May we be strengthened to continue imitating in all our actions the same spirit of selfsacrifice and love that he showed for sheeplike ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">householder, and finally getting ready to talk on the subject.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Personal goals can help us to get results on our return visits as well. The purpose of the return visit is to develop further the interest that has been manifest. What objective might we set in this regard? Trying to improve in using teaching questions and having effective Bible discussions will likely help make our return visits more effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> You might try using goals to increase the amount of time you spend in the field service or perhaps to arrange your affairs so that you can auxiliary pioneer. Another fine goal would be to start a Bible study. To whatever extent you are able to serve Jehovah, if it is whole-souled service, then it will be acceptable to him.—Matt. 13:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> A point to consider, however, is that if personal goals are not reasonable, they can be most discouraging. (Jas. 3:17) Goals must be set according to what one is able to accomplish. Otherwise, we will likely end up in discouragement if we do not succeed. Everyone has a different makeup physically and emotionally. We cannot expect to be able to accomplish something just because someone else does, but we should set goals according to what we can do personally. But could you set as your goal improving your conversations and your use of the Bible when speaking to householders, or perhaps even when starting a Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Can you use goals to improve the quality of your service to Jehovah? What practical objectives can you set to make improvement in your service? Once you have made a decision to work to achieve something, be sure to keep it before Jehovah in your prayers, for what better help could a person have? A goal that is forgotten is not realized. So when you make a decision, keep it in mind and ‘do just as you have resolved in your heart.’—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p></li></ul>

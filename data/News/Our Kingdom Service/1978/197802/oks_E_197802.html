<p><span class="font16">Perhaps by this time you have noted on page two of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> that there have been some decreases in the number of magazines printed. One reason for the decrease in magazine placements has been the fact that more and more emphasis has been put on witnessing to people, engaging the householders in Bible discussions, rather than merely placing literature with them. Another cause has been the, drop in the number of new subscriptions that the brothers have been getting. This has necessitated a cutting back in the production of the magazines. However, with all the fine information contained in the magazines, we are sure all of you will continue giving attention to using the magazines to good advantage in your Kingdompreaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You will be interested in the results of the Kingdom Ministry School training given to elders all across this country in the months of November and December. Qualified instructors were used to pass along the information to all the elders in attendance, using the specially prepared textbook entitled “Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock.” Among the subjects considered were these: “Imitate Jehovah, Our Loving Overseer,” “Be Whole-souled in the Evangelizing Work” and “Overseers 'Ruling for Justice Itself.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What were the results of the schooling? Perhaps the best way to judge the benefits is to let you know what some of the elders have written to the Society concerning their brief schooling. From New York State came this comment: “Expressions from many of the brothers reflected gratitude for the dignity and relaxed atmosphere, which was conducive to learning.” From Indiana this request came: “We hope it can be repeated in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIBLE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">-A Practical Guide from Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> One of God’s marvelous gifts to mankind has been his Word of truth, the Bible. It is truly a practical guide by which one comes to know God and to be guided by him as one follows the teachings of that Word. But how many of mankind know this and appreciate the value of God’s Word in their lives? Really, very few. Yet the psalmist said of God’s Word that it is a ‘lamp to one’s foot and a light to one’s roadway.’—Ps. 119:105.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> In the spirit of neighbor love, what can we do to help others benefit from the wisdom of God as found in the Bible? For one thing, we heed to be aware of some of the questions that might be raised by those not knowing about God’s Word or who doubt the value of such Word in their lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW PRACTICAL FOR MANKIND?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Some who are unacquainted with the value of the Word of God may say: “How would applying its counsel and advice help me now, in the present time? Would it make me rich, if I were poor; well, if I were ill? Would it make my life problem-free? What can it do for me?”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To Care Is to Share</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul said, “But I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with others.” (1 Cor. 9:23) In verse 19, Paul shows to what extent he was willing to go in order to do his part in extending the good news to others. He says: “For, though I am free from all persons, I have made myself the slave to all, that I may gain the most persons.” In verse 22 he continues, “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT MAY WE SHARE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Yes, to make disciples of Jesus Christ means more than sharing one hour of Bible study a week with them. Think of it! As these individuals learn of God’s will for them, they begin to see the need to leave behind some old habits, old associations, old friends, old forms of recreation, in other words, the old system. Some of these persons are even alienated from their families when they take their stand for true worship! Is it logical</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">&lt; As Christians we know that the Bible does not make the claim that such things as riches, better health and no problems in life will be the lot of those who heed its advice. We know that the Bible is not a book that takes one into a dreamworld and away from reality. It is not meant to be a book with a philosophical approach to life that refuses to face facts. What the Bible does do is face life as it is. Then, it goes a step beyond that and sets forth guidelines that will assist one in handling the problems of life. This, in many cases, results in much improvement in one’s lot in life, bringing a large measure of happiness now, but, more importantly, the promise of life under the very conditions for which mankind everywhere yearns —a time of peace, genuine love and concern for one’s fellowman under the Kingdom rule of this earth by Christ Jesus, God’s Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> The Bible does not claim to make our lives problem-free. Nevertheless, in living by its guidelines a person can find his life improved because of his own change in his </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col, 2) to</span><span class="font16"> expect them to do all this without providing some reasonable replacement in these areas? Commenting on this, Jesus said: “Truly I say to you men, No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming system of things everlasting life.”—Mark 10:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Jesus’ assurance that those who take their stand for the good news would gain new friends and family even in this system does not make this happen automatically, does it? Isn’t it really fulfilled by virtue of our efforts to make it so? In this way Jesus expressed his confidence that his disciples would extend themselves, their friendship, their support, their time, and their resources toward helping others, in imitation of his example. This type of sharing is done by those who truly CARE. Paul wrote one group</span></p>

Should be a frank, realistic approach eliciting straightforward observations from youths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Interview cross section of young people in congregation. Emphasize: (1) While we were their age once, we appreciate times are changing and the problems faced by youth are changing too. Great need for them to tell us what is going on, and when we find it hard to understand, we want them to keep on telling us—we want to know; (2) We sympathize with their needs, we stand behind them. What can we do to help them? Chairman should put young people at ease. May want to have them in front rows to facilitate interviewing. Begin by asking young ones (ages 4-18) what their respective ages are, as well as their comments on the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What grade are you in at school?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Do you like school? Why or why not? What do you think it means to be moral?</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">What could make this difficult at times?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How do you like to be treated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(To parents) Why would it be in harmony with Jesus teachings to show love and respect for our children? (Matt. 22:39)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(To young ones again) How do you earn such respect as a youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(Read Ephesians 6:4.) Do you think it is possible for parents to irritate their children? How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chairman should thank youths for their honest observations. We appreciate their association very much and want to develop and maintain good communication with them as their parents and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">12 mln: Talk. Base comments on response of youths and parents in previous part. Invite auaience to read scriptures and comment on them. Select and apply most appropriate of following Scriptural thoughts. One handling part needs to be discerning and kind. Explain that points in previous part not intended to embarrass or be offensive. Nonetheless, can learn from frank and realistic approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">. (1) If some young people do not see the need to get training and education in school, could use 1 Timothy 4:13 and Joshua 1:8 (regarding need to learn to read well); Proverbs 13:20 (regarding diligence in study being a protection); Titus 2:6, 7, 10 (regarding the desirability of young Christians' setting a fine example for schoolmates and teachers).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">(2) If there is need for parents to get closer to children, show more concern for them, do more together, use Deuteronomy 6:6, 7 and Ephesians 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(3) If young people need help to correct wrong views on experimenting with drugs, tobacco, conduct with the opposite sex, and so forth, use 2 Corinthians 7:1; Matthew 22:39; 1 Corinthians 6:18; also 6:9, 10; Galatians 6:7; Proverbs 10:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(4) If parents have been screaming at children or perhaps short-tempered with them, use Ephesians 4:31, 32; Galatians 5:22; 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(5) If children need to show more respect for parents, use Colossians 3: 20; Proverbs 30:17; 3:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">18 min: Studying with Your Children, Questions and answers. Include appropriate experiences of points made as time permits. One thing to have a fairly close-knit, well-adjusted family. Some worldly families accomplish this. Another thing to have a spiritually-minded family who stick to each other and Jehovah, reflecting spiritual training of good quality. While having a regular family study can help, much more needed if young folks are to make truth their own. The following may be helpful and practical.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">answer: Family heads can determine according to family needs. May want to have abbreviated discussion several times weekly if children are young. Good to take into consideration attention span so that most good will be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">question: How can we be sure that we are reaching hearts of our children during these discussions ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">answer: Make sure answers given in own words. Ask supplementary questions designed to determine how child really feels about matter discussed. Take time to let each one express himself so there is no misunderstanding or lack of appreciation for point being made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Published monthly by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., 117 Adams St,, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 Second-class postage paid at Brooklyn, N,Y. Printed in U.S.A.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>PIONEER SERVICE—Is It for You?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> No doubt many of you have asked yourselves: “Is the pioneer service for me?” This is commendable, for it indicates your desire to share even to a greater extent in spreading the good news of the Kingdom. That is what our dedication to Jehovah implies, does it not?—that we devote ourselves to the worship of Jehovah our God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. (Mark 12:30) However, not all of us can pioneer, and that is understandable. Some of us have family and other obligations, and others of us have poor health or we are getting on in years. But no doubt there are many more who could experience that great joy of serving our Grand Creator in pioneer service. We therefore want to take a realistic approach to this matter by answering a few questions that many have asked. One question is this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 1 ‘TVE HEARD THAT PIONEERING IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS FOR ME Oli NOT?&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> This depends in a large measure on your circumstances and Scriptural responsibilities. There are some whose position in life does not permit their spending 90 hours every month in direct Kingdom witnessing. But this does not mean that they are less faithful. There are, for example, many devoted housewives who are fine examples as Christian wives and mothers and who seek to share the good news at every opportunity. Some are moved to spend many hours each month in taking the good news to their neighbors. Their activity is productive and brings them joy in that they are privileged to lead new ones into association with the congregation. And as they have opportunity they may spend a month every so often as auxiliary pioneers, reaping the joys that come from that service. (Gal. 6:9) In their present circumstances it is just beyond their capacity to be regular pioneers. But this does not prevent them from building up the pioneer spirit in the congregation. They can take along with them in their service younger and newer publishers, helping these to become proficient in teaching others, and encouraging them to take part in auxiliary and regular pioneer work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> There are many, though, who are free of family obligations and who are in a position to pioneer. It is good, therefore, that we examine ourselves now and again, asking the question, Could I be doing more in proclaiming the good nevzs? From our study of God’s Word, all of us appreciate that we are deep into the period of the “last days.” That is why Satan’s system is surrounding us with the worsening conditions described at 2 Timothy 3:1-5. The enemy is trying to engulf all of God’s people in this loveless, materialistic world. But no! We are separate from the world, and “this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.” (1 John 5:4) So on the basis of this faith, we should be reaching out to embrace all of the privileges of service available to us. If we are free to reach out for auxiliary and, perhaps later, regular pioneer service, we should do so. This raises the question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 2 “HOW CAN I BE SURE I CAN GET ALONG ECONOMICALLY IF I GO PIONEERING?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> This too is a test of your faith. Whether we are congregation publishers, or whether we reach out for pioneer service, Jesus’ words at Matthew 6: 30-33 apply to all of us: “If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom</span><span class="font16"> and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” So, God assures us that he will provide all the necessities of life if we take him at his word, pressing on with faith in doing his will. If we are in a position that we may adjust our affairs to enter pioneer service, and take the initiative in doing this, Jehovah will continue to provide. Look the whole world over and you will never find a faithful pioneer forced to beg for bread!—Ps. 37:25, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Being practical about this, why not talk to some of the happy pioneers in your own congregation or in your circuit—those who have found joy in this service for two, three and more years, some even for 20 or 30 years. This will help to remove uncertainty as to whether pioneer service is for you. Talk with these ones who have made pioneering their vocation, and who continue to rejoice in this service. They can explain just how they do it. They can tell you of the initial problems that they had to overcome, how they schedule their service, their meetings and other duties, so that nothing is neglected. And once you have started to pioneer, these “old hands” can no doubt continue to give you good advice. Have faith, too, that Jehovah can provide ways to overcome even mountainlike obstacles.—Matt. 17:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> A circuit overseer who recently visited Brooklyn from the Orient told of a sister who often shared in auxiliary pioneer work. Her example indicates what faith can do. She was living in Manchuria when the atom bomb destroyed Hiroshima, and with it most of her family. The shock of this news so weakened her physical system that, shortly after she returned to Japan, she became an invalid, paralyzed in her entire body. Then she learned the truth and was baptized. How she wanted to tell this glorious hope to others! Though she could use only the muscles of her face, she learned to write with a pencil or crayon in her mouth, and to illustrate beautifully the writings that she would send out to interested persons concerning the Kingdom hope. She would also witness to many others who called to see her at her home. When the circuit overseer visited, he found that she had averaged 106 hours in service for the previous six months. What a fine illustration of how invincible faith can help overcome obstacles to having </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font16"> fuller share in the spreading of the good news!</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, FEBRUARY 1978</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">’ Longtime pioneers can tell thrilling stories concerning the conquests made by virtue of their faith. They can tell of times when everything looked dark; nevertheless, they kept on, and then in most unexpected ways the problems often were removed to enable them to continue enjoying their treasured pioneer service. Though they may have become worn out and tired at times, their selfsacrificing course has brought rich blessings from Jehovah. They are a demonstration that, true to his promise, Jehovah “is giving to the tired one power; and to the one without dynamic energy he makes full might abound.*<sup>1</sup>—Isa. 40:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>s</sup> The pressures of this materialistic world seem to affect some more than others. However, we should have faith that these pressures need not block our becoming pioneers. In some countries where materialistic enticements abound, great numbers of our fellow Christians are sharing in pioneer work. For example, in Japan, upwards of 25 percent of all publishers are presently enjoying some features of the pioneer service each month. What has made it possible for these and others throughout the world to take up the pioneer service?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>0</sup> Successful pioneers are spiritually motivated, and this of course is something they have' in common with all of God’s servants who are serving whole-souled. All of us, for example, believe that we are living in the “last days.” We love Jehovah and his arrangements for our everlasting happiness. We do not feel this is just another religion. Though there are many material things around us, we make every effort not to be captured by such things. Those who have decided to pioneer, however, often have taken a fresh look at their economic circumstances. They have developed a concept of life which is to live simply, and they are industrious. In short, after thoroughly evaluating their circumstances they have made room for this in their fives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>10</sup> In areas where many participate in the pioneer work, youths frequently enter this service immediately after high school, often because parents have set this goal before them from childhood. Bible students may already have pioneering as a goal before they are baptized. Many housewives in Japan who are pioneers have found it a definite advantage to keep their homes simple and uncluttered. After the children leave for school, these sisters clean the house efficiently and quickly and then head out into the service. Some heads of families have taken part-time jobs that others dislike—jobs that have early hours or disagreeable work—so they can pioneer. In many cases, it is this different approach to their economic situation that has enabled some to do more in Jehovah’s service by means of the pioneer work. In faith, these brothers and sisters have reached out and have been blessed with the joys of pioneer service. Can you reach out and experience similar joys? It is for you to weigh your circumstances, consider the opportunities, and decide. But, then, someone asks:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 3 &quot;I AM A TEEN-AGER AND CAN HARDLY FORESEE WHAT I WANT TO DO BEYOND THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR SO, MUCH LESS CONSIDER PIONEERING AS A LIFETIME CAREER.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>11</sup> The word “career” has a sense of permanency that you may not be ready for, and that is understandable. You may not be familiar with the pioneer work. Perhaps you have given some thought to getting married and raising a family, -with its obvious effect on your ability to stay in the pioneer service. These are valid matters of personal concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>12</sup> Then, too, for many young people, the time leading to and following graduation from high school is one of uncertainty. Until now your time ■has been largely programmed for you, and you have not had a lot of decisions to make about your own life. But this is all the more reason why you should give careful thought to what you are going to do next.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>13</sup> Your decisions at this point may determine to a large extent what direction your life will take in the coming years. So even though your goals may not be fixed yet, likely you do want to fill your life with something that will be rewarding and fulfilling. Rather than automatically filling the vacuum left after finishing school with a full-time job, why not think about spending a few months auxiliary pioneering? If you enjoy it, you may decide to go on to regular pioneering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>14</sup> After several months or a year of such service, probably your view of what you want to do with your life will be somewhat clearer. Even if the decision is to marry, many couples have benefited greatly from the experience of pioneering together during the early part of their marriage—one or both often continuing in the pioneer service throughout married life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>15</sup> In any event, whether single or married, your period of pioneering will have advanced and rounded out your education in a way that no other activity or career training can provide. The experience you will have gained in approaching and dealing with people of various backgrounds, in facing and overcoming obstacles on your own and in developing personal organization and selfdiscipline will be invaluable to you in later life. And remember—you will never really know unless you try it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>16</sup> Circumstances in life change for all of us. Remember that none of us know what tomorrow will bring. There are few things in life that can remain truly permanent. So why not take a serious look at your present situation and weigh the matter of pioneering carefully. If nothing hinders you now other than indecision, why not set out on a course you know to be in line with Jehovah’s will for our time? It may prove to be the best career for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 4 &quot;I’VE HEARD IT SAID THAT MEETING PIONEER REQUIREMENTS CAN BECOME A REAU PRESSURE IF YOU FAIL TO MAKE YOUR TIME DUE TO SICKNESS OR OTHER MAJOR PROBLEMS.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>17</sup> It is true that if you enroll in the regular pioneer service you will be asked to spend at least 90 hours each month in the field service, or 1,000 hours each year. Under normal conditions, most pioneers find this to be a reasonable goal. On the average, this means spending only about three hours a day in the field service. Of course, pressures could easily develop if you do not properly schedule your time and if you lack the selfdiscipline to stick to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>18</sup> However, serious acute illness or other major unforeseen events could also cause you to lose a lot of time in the Kingdom work. To make up for this, you might have to spend five, six or even more hours witnessing each day for several months. Or, a pioneer may drop behind by a hundred or more hours early in the service year due to some unforeseen circumstance. Then later in the year, as he works to make up the lost time, what if another serious problem arises and puts him even further behind in reaching the goals? This, together with trying to support himself by part-time work could get to be a real burden, weighing heavily on the conscientious pioneer’s mind. Apparently many choose not to become pioneers because of worrying about what may never happen. Is there a solution?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>79</sup> Yes. We would like you to know that if you are temporarily ill, or for some other urgent reason you cannot meet the required minimum of hours for a few months, you may ask the body of elders in your congregation to write the Society a letter to accompany your report, giving us the details of your problem. If the elders, after thorough consideration, think it would be advisable for you to be allowed to continue on in the pioneer service </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">without worrying about making up the lost time, </span><span class="font16">then they should make that recommendation to us, and we will be pleased to give consideration to your circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>20</sup> Of course, with the present arrangement of only 1,000 hours required for the year, it is not expected that pioneers would be taking time away from their pioneer service for nonessential activities that would cause them to fall behind in their hours in the service. Or if the reason for low hours is poor scheduling or lack of selfdiscipline, the pioneer should feel it necessary to make up such lost time. However, where there is an unusual period of sickness, or accidents or serious family problems suddenly come along, you may be assured that we will consider your needs as a pioneer. We believe this arrangement will remove some of the pressure from pioneers who have good reason to request consideration in this matter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>21</sup> Many pioneers have been zealous servants of Jehovah for years and with all their hearts want to continue on in the pioneer work, and we want them to do so. But what if one finds that he just cannot meet the requirements consistently over a long period of time? Then, no doubt it would be the course of wisdom to return to serving as a congregation publisher and share whenever possible in the auxiliary pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>22</sup> However, we hope that this additional consideration for the problems of pioneers will encourage those already enrolled to continue with their sacred service, and we hope, too, that for those of you considering the pioneer work, a possible obstacle in the way of a positive decision has been removed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 5 &quot;I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THAT I AM REALLY ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING IN WHAT I DO AND I WANT TO BE HAPPY DOING IT. WILL PIONEERING GIVE ME THIS KIND OF SATISFACTION ?&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>23</sup> Well, what does it take to make you happy? Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount lists nine ways to be happy. (Matt. 5:3-12) Some of the things he lists may or may not, on the surface, appeal to you as a source of happiness. But in reflecting on these “happinesses,” do not the underlying principles strike home? They show that neither one’s present situation in life subject to time and unforeseen occurrence, nor purely humanitarian acts bring true happiness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>M</sup> Rather, complete happiness, Jesus teaches, stems from activities related to the worship of Jehovah and the fulfillment of his promises. It comes from doing what we know deep-down to be right. True, there are many things in life that bring a measure of happiness, but happiness can only be truly complete when we add the sense of purpose that spiritual pursuits bring. And Jesus wisely pointed out the greater happiness of giving to others compared to just enjoying things ourselves. Certainly there is no greater gift that we can offer to our fellowman than the hope of everlasting life.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>25</sup> But, you may ask, How can pioneering make me feel that I am accomplishing something, vyhen I know that some publishers are even more successful in helping people learn the truth than some pioneers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>26</sup> First, it would be good to put what constitutes “accomplishment” into proper focus. Success cannot always be judged by outward results. Some people, because of their personalities or natural abilities, are quite successful in persuading others to accept Jehovah’s sovereignty and they are indeed blessed for their work. But it is not numbers that count with Jehovah. Rather, it is what we do in a heartfelt way to publicize and honor his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>27</sup> And sometimes results are not readily apparent. Our work may have a powerful influence for good even if we do not seem to be as productive as others. This point was made by the wise man at Ecclesiastes 11:6: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>28</sup> If your happiness comes from permanent, worthwhile things, rather than the fleeting benefits offered by the world, and if you are convinced that Jehovah’s kingdom will soon provide life in abundance to all who serve him and your circumstances will allow you to share more fully in telling others about it—then, yes, pioneering will give you a sense of accomplishment that will indeed make you a happy person.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ques. 6 “WHETHER I PIONEER OR NOT— ISN’T THAT MY OWN BUSINESS, SINCE IT’S NOT REQUIRED FOR EVEREASTING LIFE?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>29</sup> True, pioneering is not a requirement for everlasting life. But serving God with a complete heart and with our whole soul is. And when it comes to pioneering, the principle of 2 Corinthians 9:7 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(The New English Bible)</span><span class="font16"> is appropriate: “Each person should give as he has decided for himself; there should be no reluctance, no sense of compulsion; God loves a cheerful giver.” So if others were to try to decide if </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font16"> should pioneer, it would involve judging your circumstances and your heart, something that we humans have no right to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>30</sup> Obviously it is up to each one personally to determine what to do, in accord with one’s heart motivation and circumstances. “Let him prove what his own work is,” writes Paul, “and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.”—Gal. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>31</sup> So, to the question of who should pioneer, we have to agree that only you can answer. But we hope the information here provided will help you to weigh this important matter in the proper light. There are some indicators that may assist you to reach the right decision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>32</sup> F<sub>Or</sub> example, if you are strongly attracted to the “good life” and want to surround yourself with material possessions, then likely pioneering will have little appeal to you. Spending 90 hours a month in the disciple-making work and caring for other responsibilities in this system of things calls for a spirit of self-sacrifice. This does not mean that pioneers are trying to please God by practicing self-denial. Balanced pioneers do not necessarily give ‘until it hurts.’ On the other hand, they do not feel that it hurts to give.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">33 Another factor you should seriously review is whether you are considering pioneering for the right reasons, spiritual reasons. Those who undertake this service for less than spiritual reasons often find that it soon loses its appeal. The reality that it is work soon makes them lose- interest. For example, if one pioneers merely because his best friends are doing it, he may not have a solid basis for continuing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup>* Neither should pioneering be a way for some to feel superior to others who are not doing so. To view oneself this way would be to assume that one is serving God whole-souled and others are not. This would be a dangerous attitude to adopt, even as Paul declares: “Who are you to judge the house servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls.”-—Rom. 14:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>35</sup> On the other hand, if you are willing to place first priority on helping others to come to a knowledge of God and his purposes, then pioneering merits your serious consideration. Of course, your circumstances should be such that you could meet the requirements by adjusting your affairs, making the needed sacrifices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>38</sup> If you hesitate simply because you doubt your own capabilities or are uncertain about what the future may bring, then we can only recommend the advice Jehovah gives to those willing to trust him by doing their part: “Put me to the proof .. . and see if I do not open windows in the sky and pour a blessing on you as long as there is need.” —Mal. 3:10, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The New English Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">So, is pioneering for you? We rejoice with you if this information has enabled you to say—“Yes, for me!” And if it is your decision to pioneer, you may indeed look forward to a most joyful privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Care Is to Share &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">of Christians, “So, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">having a tender affection for you,</span><span class="font16"> we were well pleased to impart to you, not only the good news of God, but </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">also our own souls,</span><span class="font16"> because you became beloved to us.”—1 Thess. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNSELFISHNESS REQUIRED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Sharing to this extent requires a great degree of unselfishness. It means doing for these potential disciples many of the things we appreciate from our friends and family. It may be as little as telephoning them during the week to see how they are doing, or it may be as much as helping them to locate employment. Are you a carpenter? Have you offered to repair that small item in their home that you observed in need of some attention? Are you a mother? Could you help on occasion with the children? Can you invite them to your home for a meal? or go to their home for one? Due to an existing need, some brothers and sisters have helped their students to learn how to drive. Others have shown deserving ones in need where to shop for bargains locally, helped them to move and even repaired their automobiles. Are your students starting to discuss their newly found hope with others? Can you provide encouragement and assistance for them to do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Sharing sometimes involves accepting rather than offering something. For example, accepting an invitation from a wife who is studying to come over and share a meal with her and her opposing husband. Or accepting an offer from your student to help you in some small, practical way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> It is good to keep in mind that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">caring</span><span class="font16"> comes first, then </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">sharing.</span><span class="font16"> Caring is the cause; sharing is the effect. We should care about people because God loves them, and we should share with them, not merely as a means to an end, but because we really care. Sharing with these potential disciples should not be difficult, as sharing should be a way of life for us as Christians. As a matter of fact, sharing with these interested persons should really be an extension of our relationship with our brothers and sisters. Paul said, “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font16"> but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) If we really care about those with whom we study the Bible, they will likely come to appreciate the truth, not only as correct doctrine, but as it really is—a way of life.</span></p></li></ul>

The Bible directs people away from those things that can damage the emotions and sour the attitudes of individuals. (Eph. 4:31, 32) Replacing negative views with a positive outlook, the Bible and its practical counsel can certainly be a contributing factor in one’s gain-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting Schedule Adjustments</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Beginning with the month of March, the length of public talks in the congregation will be reduced to 45 minutes. This will include the public talks given by circuit overseers when they visit congregations. This adjustment means that the total time for both the public meeting and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font16">study of the congregation each week will be two hours, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">including the songs and prayers.</span><span class="font16"> This will allow for a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> study of about one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When the circuit overseer visits he will give a 45-minute public talk, followed by a one-half hour </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> study without paragraphs being read, and then he will give his concluding talk. The entire meeting, including the songs and prayers, can be handled in a total of two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Public speakers can continue to use their prepared outlines but will have in mind adjusting their public talks by reducing the amount of material they cover in the future so as to complete their talks in 45 minutes. Occasionally there may be a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font16"> public talk that will be 55 minutes or longer in length, which means the overall meeting time will run over two hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN WE DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> Why not encourage someone you know, a friend, relative or neighbor, to get better acquainted with the Bible? By regularly having a share in talking to people in your congregation territory about this practical book, you will bring joy to many and satisfaction to yourself.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> During February the offer, on a contribution of 60 cents, will be two 384- or 416-page bound books from the stock that you have in your congregation, along with one of the following pocket-size books: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God'?, God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font16"> May our course of neighbor love bring many good results as we tell others about the Bible—the practical guide from Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To Total Strengers</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For many of us it is very difficult to approach the home of a total stranger to converse about the Bible and God’s kingdom. To talk to a friend, neighbor or relative, someone with whom we are acquainted, does not present nearly the problem that talking to a stranger does. To assist us in preparing ourselves for this work of evangelizing among strangers, the following questions and answers may prove helpful.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">1.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What is the first thing to have in mind?</span><span class="font16"> Prayer to Jehovah for his help and blessing to go with us as we seek to do his will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">2.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> How do you approach the door?</span><span class="font16"> We need the right frame of mind. This means we do not want to prejudge the householder. We may subconsciously do so by thinking that the neighborhood in which he lives, the predominant religion of the area, the general view of the people, automatically mean this stranger at the door is not going to be interested in what we have to say. Rather, we want .to view each person as a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">potential friend, </span><span class="font16">interested in the good news that we are bringing, leaving the outcome and the judgment in Jehovah’s hands. With this view we should feel more at ease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">3.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What do we first say to the householder?</span><span class="font16"> Something that should be encouraging to the stranger you face. For example, a warm greeting, a word about the weather or the person’s home if it is neat and well kept, something that will show we are interested in the person to whom we speak. Then in a kind way bring to his attention the purpose of our call. The Topic for Conversation this month suggests using an approach based on Psalm 119:105. A comment to the householder that may be appropriate is that as humans all of us look to someone or something as a guide. We might ask: “Have you ever thought about the guide the Almighty God has</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">God's Word—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font0"> Practical Guide for Our Time.—Psalm 119:105. </span><span class="font16">given us to help us in meeting the problems of life?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">4.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What next?</span><span class="font16"> At this point, if at all possible, draw the stranger into the conversation. Ask his opinion. If he is willing, let him express himself. Don’t worry that you will have to do all the talking. Be a good listener. Even if his views are contrary to yours, that need not be a problem. You are not there to argue but to offer to show him what God’s Word says.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">5.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What if a question is asked that you do not know the answer to?</span><span class="font16"> You need not fear if this should happen. Straightforwardly say that you do not know the answer, but you will find out and return to pass along what you have learned for the person’s benefit. This may open the way for a fine return visit. When we do not know something, there is every reason to admit it. Oftentimes our honesty impresses the householder and may lead to his listening more intently when we return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">6.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What if the householder is rude, definitely not interested?</span><span class="font16"> We can offer no better advice than that found in God’s Word. “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” (Prov. 15:1) “Let your reasonableness become known to all men.” (Phil. 4:5) Being reasonable, we will not take their rejection as a personal affront, realizing that it may well be because they do not understand the value of what we bring. We can leave graciously, with some kind expression and this may have a beneficial effect on the person.—Compare Colos-sians 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">7.</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"> What is our objective in our evangelizing work?</span><span class="font16"> Our objective is to preach the good news of the Kingdom, to make disciples of people of all the nations, teaching them. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Our success is not dependent on what we distribute in the way of literature, though, of course, we know such would indeed be a blessing to those who are receptive. Living the truth as we spread the Word of truth among strangers is what brings great praise to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

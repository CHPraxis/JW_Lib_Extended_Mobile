<p><span class="font2">Congregations throughout the country had some encouraging results from the tract distribution in September. One elder stated that: “Now our congregation has no shortage of return visits to go on.” Others had similar expressions. There were over 220,000 more books placed this September in connection with the tract work than were placed in September 1976.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There have been some interesting developments in recent months. For example, at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania on October 1, 1977, it was announced that plans are being made to computerize the printing operations in Brooklyn and at the Watchtower Farms. At present, we do have a small business computer in operation. With the use of this computer we hope to save time and be of better service to our brothers in the months ahead. However, during the transitional period delays may occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of December the first groups of pioneers were scheduled to attend the Pioneer Service Schools. These schools are situated in 13 different areas in the United States. About 350 were scheduled to attend the first of these two-week classes. Other classes will be scheduled for March and April as well as this fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to the Pioneer Service School, the first sessions of the Five-Week Gilead Course for the benefit of the Branch Committee members was scheduled to begin at the close of December at Brooklyn Bethel. These courses will provide training in handling Scriptural and committee matters, operations in the Society’s Bethel homes and printing facilities, and cover other subjects that will be useful to the brothers in their assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With all of these fine provisions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">“Love One Another Intensely from the Heart”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> How do you feel about your brothers and sisters in the congregation? Having accepted the truth yourself and molded your life to conform to God’s will, do you count each member of the congregation—each brother and sister—as bought with the same precious blood and equally loved by God? If so, your love will be unhypocritical—intensely from the heart-—and will manifest itself in deeds. Are you showing this love? —1 Pet. 1:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">can we show this love?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> We want to help everyone we can spiritually. But in our busy lives do we forget the other needs that people have? For example, some may be physically unable to mow their lawn or shovel snow, take out the garbage, or clean the house, and may also be financially unable to hire someone to do it. Or the problem may be repairs on the home. Elderly or sick persons may appreciate your doing some painting or repairs around the home. In some cases you may run an errand to shop for groceries or other items or to take care of some necessary business for them. In addition to our making public declaration to God’s name, Hebrews 13:16 encourages</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;All Day Long I Will Bless You&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Those inside and outside the Christian congregation are in need of spiritual encouragement. Family members need it. Older brothers and sisters as well as those new in the truth need it. Those who are depressed or facing other problems need it. (1 ThesS- 5:14, 15) You can prove to be a blessing to many of them. How? By being a person who makes opportunities to talk to them about spiritual matters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> At Psalm 145:2 King David said to Jehovah: “All day long I will bless you.” How refreshing this must have been to other spiritually-minded persons who associated with David. David found that he had much to talk about because as verse three of this Psalm states: “Jehovah is great and very much to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.” Are not all who grow in appreciation of Jehovah’s greatness moved to feel the same way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> How does a person acquire us: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> All of us have a special responsibility toward widows in their tribulation, as Jesus’ half brother pointed out at James 1:27. Lonesomeness is a distressing thing for many bereaved persons or older ones. Sisters, both old and young, could take turns visiting widows or sisters who are ill. They could read together, sew, or talk, or help the handicapped one to telephone others or to write letters in witnessing. Occasionally a sister or two could cook a meal and take it to the home of the “shut-in.” At the same time an atmosphere of love and good fellowship will be enjoyed by all involved. Brothers, including younger ones, could help sick or shut-in brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What a bond of love and unity can be built up in a congregation if all “love one another intensely from the heart”! Sometimes it will cost time and money. But our willingness to share with our brothers is evidence of the genuineness of our love. (John 13:34, 35) Moreover, God can equalize matters and increase our blessings in many ways, and he will do so.—2 Cor. 8:14; 9:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">such heart appreciation for Jehovah? Psalm 145:5 answers when David states: “The glorious splendor of your dignity and the matters of your wonderful works </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I will make my concern.&quot;</span><span class="font2"> Yes, to be moved to praise Jehovah “all day long,” a person must take time to meditate on Jehovah’s works of creation. Making time to study regularly Jehovah’s “wonderful works” of the past, described in the Bible, will also enhance our heart appreciation. Constantly including expressions of praise in our prayers to Jehovah will further warm our hearts toward him. However, care must be exercised that timeconsuming things or those that could endanger our spirituality, such as the excessive watching of television, are not allowed to interfere. It is good to remember that what we talk about is a good reflection of what is in our heart. A good spiritual input obviously </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Dorcas of Joppa was commended as faithful. (Acts 9:36-39) What valuable contribution did she make to Christian congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Outstanding also was Priscilla, wife of Aquila. (Use material in p. 1343, particularly reading scriptures cited and entertaining audience comment on her valuable activities and zeal.) Many sisters today engage in helping others. Then, let audience comment on things that sisters, young and old, can do to be loved by God and congregation as those women were.</span></p>

Discussion is casual with friendly atmosphere. Son not put on spot with questions that are too pointed. Closer bond results. (2) Mother asks daughter if she would like to accompany her in field service. Cheerful conversation as they walk from door to door. Daughter is asked how things are going at school. Pauses at first, hesitant, but then slowly reveals she was offered drugs by a boy she likes. Didn't know what co do, tempted to accept. Mother maintains calm composure. Cheerfully suggests that later they can talk about it further. Daughter pleased.

<li>
<p><span class="font16">(3) Everyday life, family problems, and so forth.

<li>
<p><span class="font16">(2) Experiences had due to taking advantage of situations coming up during daily routines. (Select meaningful experiences in advance in accord with situations like those mentioned in paragraph two.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">(3) Have some from their seats tell how they have started conversations with neighbors, co-workers or schoolmates.</span></p></li>

(Speaker give brief introduction, then ask questions, discuss scriptures cited. Use what material you can in time allotted.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While men generally have duties that bring them more prominently before the congregation, women can, in eyes of God and Christ, be just as beloved if they serve well in ways that God has provided. Many different services open to them. Consider Anna. (Luke 2:36-38) How was she in “constant” attendance at temple? (She evidently did not stay there day and night, but was never absent at appropriate or usual times for public worship, and went privately at other times.) What was she doing? (Comment that Israelites and proselytes from all parts of earth, as well as being of all ages and walks of life, came to worship. Then read Luke 2:38 for answer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then, there was Lydia of Philippi. (Acts 16:13-15) What traits were outstanding in Lydia? Entertain audience comment on Lydia’s personality and tures. More concern over rules than doing what is merciful and loving. (Rom. 14:1-4, 10) Practicing self-denial to harm of one's health. Should not be overly critical of others, meddling in their problems.—1 John 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">25 min: Talk and discussion on article: “Make Wise Use of Your Elders.” Highlight following scriptures: 1 Cor. 3:2123; Eph. 4:8, 11; Jas. 5:13-16. Ask audience: Why should even the meekest congregation member not hesitate to approach an elder for help ? How should elders feel toward the flock? (Belongs to Jehovah, in need of tender care, and a joy to work in their interests.) How can we best take advantage of their experience? (In field service, with personal problems and so forth. Include other appropriate examples.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">17 min: Talk on article in October 1, 1977, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font16"> “Do Not Become ‘Enraged Against Jehovah,’ ” Involve audience. Apply the following scriptures and points In your discussion: What kind of person becomes enraged against Jehovah? (Prov. 19:3) Why God cannot be blamed for our problems. (Eccl. 9: 11) If one misses meetings due to being offended by another, what is he really saying? To whom is disloyalty being shown when congregation is rejected? (Ps. 119:165) Necessary to safeguard heart and keep balance. (Prov. 4:23; 1 Pet. 1:13) Song 15 and prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> All the elders were pleased to learn on the second day of the “Joyful Workers” District Assembly that they were going to be able to attend the Kingdom Ministry School course in November and December. How can all of us benefit from the school?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The school underscored the serious responsibility of the elders to shepherd every one of Jehovah’s sheep lovingly, to expend themselves unselfishly in behalf of the flock. Rather than standing apart from the congregation, the elders “belong to you.” (1 Cor. 3:21-23) That is, they are primarily in their assigned positions to render service to their brothers. When you become spiritually sick, do you “call the older men,” seeking the spiritual benefits that come from their experience and training? (Jas. 5:14) When problems or questions that | you cannot solve come up in your life, do you wait for an elder to render help? If you have a question that the elder cannot answer, he will tell you so. But, perhaps he may be able to assist you to find the Scriptural answer. In the early Christian congregation the older men were “gifts” to their brothers. (Eph. 4:8) The same applies today. Let us benefit from the service they are able to render.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> The importance of being an effective teacher was another subject stressed in the school. The elder’s teaching is always to be based upon God’s Word as was Jesus’ instruction. (Matt. 4:4) His motive should be to honor our Father in heaven. (John 8:49, 50) When teaching in the congregation, the elders are to teach “the word.” (2 Tim. 4:2) We I are not given numerous rules in the , Bible, so elders are encouraged not to make unnecessary rules for their | brothers. How much the elders can benefit their brothers if their teaching is baaed on the principles of</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">the Bible and they assist them to develop a good, clean conscience! So if you approach an elder for advice on a matter, he is in a position to help you to reason on the various principles that apply and show you portions of God’s Word that can help you to make the right decision.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The matter of taking the lead and giving training in evangelizing work was also given careful consideration. In the United States there has been a drop in field service activity recently. Elders were reminded that the evangelizing work is more important than ever and that only “whole-souled” service is pleasing to Jehovah. (Col. 3:23) Accordingly, they should give careful attention to this activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> However, do not feel that you must wait for an elder to invite you to share with him in this evangelizing work. Especially would this apply to our many new ones recently starting to praise Jehovah. We encourage you to approach your book study conductor or any one of the elders and ask him if you can share with him in the field service. Elders are encouraged to make it a regular practice to invite others to share with them in the field service. The closer relationship thia brings will likely prompt you to seek the elders’ help in other matters. If you do this, problems can often be handled before they grow to serious proportions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> In whatever time remains of this present old order, all who are truly elders will be working harder than ever to build up their brothers now, while they have opportunity. To all others, now is the time to take advantage of this provision of Jehovah. To such ones we say, “Make wise use of your elders.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">By Being Resourceful</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> There is much to be learned when we study the example of Jesus Christ. Jesus taught us to follow his example in ‘letting our light shine.’ (Matt. 5:14-16) To achieve this in an effective way we must be resourceful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> When a sister goes to a laundromat, could she take her Bible, some literature and—particularly this month—some subscription blanks? Could it be that with a little initiative on her part she could strike up a conversation on world conditions, a recent local happening or something that someone else says? Those who use public transportation, who regularly visit a doctor’s office or who otherwise are in contact with people, Can be prepared to take advantage of these situations too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> For example, you might be reading the January 1, 1978, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> in the presence of a co-worker during your lunch break and comment on how peoples’ attitudes toward one another have changed in recent years. Then you might ask if your co-worker feels that the lowering of moral standards is a contributing factor. After getting his response, you could explain that the reason you asked was that you were just reading an article <sub>4</sub>that shows how an accused murderer of a number of people got his “inspiration” from pornographic literature. Then you could call his attention to the scripture in the panel in the middle of page three, Romans </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">12:9, 19. </span><span class="font2">Pursue the conversation and, if</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All Day ... I Will Bless You&quot; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font2">will make us a blessing to one another.—Luke 6:45.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> As we grow in appreciation of Jehovah’s marvelous qualities, including his goodness, we will find ourselves ‘bubbling over’ about him, in accord with Psalm 145:7. No one will have to urge us to speak about spiritual matters to those inside or outside the Christian congregation. We will praise Jehovah on every appropriate occasion because our hearts will be full of deep-rooted feeling for Jehovah due to our time and circumstances favor it, you could offer the subscription.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> In our regular field activity from house to house this month, we can show resourcefulness. For example, a brother in house-to-house witnessing met a woman who said: “I am Greek. Can’t speak English.” He smiled, showed her the second page of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> where it states that it is published in Greek. He briefly stated with meaningful gestures that she could get it regularly in the mail. She subscribed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Another brother met a woman at the door who said that she did not have much time. He stated, “Well, maybe we can get a chance to speak with you at length the next time we come. We are showing people from the Bible that the Kingdom is a righteous government under Jesus Christ that will soon bring peace to people of all races and nations. Before leaving I did want to mention that you can get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> which explains these things in detail. It comes out twice a month.” This took only a minute and a half, but she subscribed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> At times, discerning what a particular situation calls for can make the difference between success and failure. (Prov. 25:11) Each of us should meditate regularly on situations that confront us. Deciding how we can best take advantage of these situations with the goal of helping others get salvation is what is involved in our being resourceful </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in presenting the good news.—1 Cor.</span><span class="font2"> 9:19-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">knowledge and appreciation of him and his Son.—Col. 2:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> What will result if we are generous in our expressions of praise about Jehovah? Those in our family will be encouraged </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">and strengthened.</span><span class="font2"> Other brothers and sisters to whom we speak will be incited to “love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) Those outside the Christian congregation to whom we give a witness can be motivated to “look hopefully” to Jehovah due to developing faith in him. (Ps. 145:15) All who listen can, therefore, be protected from the frustrating economic problems, unwholesome recreational activity and other pressures that can weaken our faith and cause us to lose sight of our relationship with Jehovah.—Prov. 18:10.</span></p></li>

<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>New Literature Rates</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">Throughout the world costs are increasing. The materials we use in the production of our literature are costing more than ever before. Shipping and mailing costs have also gone up. We have reached the point where it is necessary to increase the prices of some of our publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As announced in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font16"> last month, as of January 1, 1978, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> subscriptions will increase in price to §2.00 for a year’s subscription and §1.00 for six months. At the same time the individual copies of the magazines will be offered for 10 cents per copy in the United States. Prices of individual copies to the congregations and pioneers in this country will be double what they were, namely, 8 cents to the congregations and 2 cents to the pioneers. Congregations will remit §1.85 for each subscription obtained by publishers and §1.00 on pioneers’ subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Also affected by the price increase from January 1 on is the regular edition of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font16"> In the United States the price change goes up to §1.50 for the public. This means that the congregations will be charged §1.40 and the pioneers 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In some languages we publish only the Christian </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Scriptures. The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font16"> will change proportionately. The public price will be 75c. Congregations will remit 70c, and pioneers 40c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There will be no change in the price of the deluxe edition of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font16"> at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This increase in the literature rates on the above items will help the Society to meet the higher production and shipping costs involved and still make it possible for people everywhere to receive these publications for a small contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Latter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we are excited over the expectations for the future. We are continuing to plan for future advancement and expansion with complete awareness that the “day of Jehovah” is approaching.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2 Pet. </span><span class="font2">3:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brothers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font2">ents who regularly discuss spiritual matters with their children will help them learn to love Jehovah. By responding to the spiritual needs of others in the congregation, speaking “consolingly to the depressed souls,” we will benefit our Christian brothers. And we should seek opportunities to give a witness on every occasion, conversing with people about Jehovah and his promises, thus benefiting many more in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> The person with deep appreciation for Jehovah looks for opportunities to “bless” him. He has something in his heart he </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wants to tell.</span><span class="font2"> (Ps. 40:8-10) We are richly blessed and are able to be a blessing to others when we become servants, who, like King David, desire to bless Jehovah “all day long.”</span></p>

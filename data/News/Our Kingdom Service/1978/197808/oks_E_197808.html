<p><span class="font16">The “Victorious Faith” International Conventions are under way! From the preliminary figures, it is apparent that many from the United States of America have been or will be visiting in other countries. For example, close to 1,500 are going to the Caribbean, and about as many to Europe. Over 3,700 made plans to go to Hawaii. Nearly 100 are going to Africa, and as many to South America. So far, about 1,200 will be going to either Mexico or Central America. Some 150 or more are scheduled to go to the Orient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Tours to Israel have been continuing since April and on into the summer. From preliminary estimates it appears that upwards of 15,000 planned to go to Israel, with over 700 traveling from the United States and thousands from Europe. In addition to arranging a very-educational tour throughout this Bible land, the brothers in Israel arranged special meetings for the benefit of their guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thousands have already come from around the world to attend conventions in this country. Many of these are missionaries or others in the full-time service who have been able to return to their home country for a visit because of your generous contributions, and they wish to thank you for your kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Brother F. W. Franz visited Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines in May and June. Special talks were arranged to give encouragement according to the need. In Japan, branch facilities will be expanded on a large tract of land that was purchased. The faith of our brothers in Korea and Taiwan is being severely tested because of their separateness from the world. Fine increases are taking place in Hong Kong and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We send Christian greetings to all of you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Joy Comes in Talking About Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> It was a command from Jehovah that his worshipers in ancient times should come before him with rejoicing. (Deut. 12:18) Why should they not rejoice and praise Jehovah in view of his rich blessings upon them?—Ps. 20:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> We too have many occasions for rejoicing before Jehovah. Consider the joy that is ours in connection with large and small assemblies, in addition to the joyous refreshment of regular weekly meetings in the congregation. Daily we can rejoice because Jehovah has provided abundantly for our spiritual needs. We have the joyous hope of everlasting life by means of his Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">« Appreciating these gifts from God, we are moved to speak to others about him, and this increases our joy even more, since “ ‘there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’ ”•—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASING OUR JOY IN FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> But does opposition cause your joy to diminish? Does indifference, or not finding people at home discourage you? Perhaps you tend to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">' Now Is the Especially Acceptable Time&quot;!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Yes, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">NOW</span><span class="font16"> is the time! Time for what? Time for sheeplike persons to be accepted into Jehovah’s favor. The door is still open! The hearts of people are still being turned toward Jehovah in the time yet remaining. And Jehovah, in effect, has said to them: “ ‘In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.' Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.”—2 Cor. 6:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> How should God’s patience affect us? It should move us to do our utmost while God’s “day of salvation” continues. Jesus said: “We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day.” (John 9:4) So we must work while we are still “in an acceptable time” for God to hear people. Paul asks: “How . . . will they hear without someone to preach?”—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">APPRECIATE THE &quot;ACCEPTABLE TIME&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> How many more opportunities be shy. Your personality may be such that it is not natural for you to approach strangers readily, even when you really want to talk about things that are dear to your heart. How can you experience the same joy that others find in preaching the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> First, remember that joy is a fruit of the spirit. It must be cultivated. Although Jehovah has promised to help you by his spirit, you must put forth effort to get the blessing. He wants you to have the joy that comes in knowing you have his favor. Our joy may be reflected in a happy countenance, but really it means much more than that—our having that deep inner feeling of well-being that comes from pleasing Jehovah in all our worship and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> Consider the lives of Jesus and the early Christians. They had many hardships and sometimes painful experiences, but they had joy in abundance. For example, the apostles were taken into custody, scolded for preaching the good news and then flogged. What was their attitude? Read Acts 5:41, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3) </span><span class="font16">will your relatives, workmates, children and neighbors have to hear, as Jehovah’s “acceptable time” runs out? Paul said: “‘Today if you people listen to his own voice, do not harden your hearts. . . ” (Heb. 3:15) While these words were directed to Hebrew Christians, they should also have meaning to those now needing to hear the good news. Tomorrow may be too late for some. So we must continue to search from door to door for those whom Jehovah will yet accept and draw to himself. Jehovah, in this “day of salvation,” is still allowing time for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> What about people in our territory who were not at home or were busy when we called? As long as Jehovah’s “day of salvation” continues, there will be further opportunity for some of these to have Jehovah’s favor. Yes, working “not at homes” and making </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1}</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font14">Enjoyable Theocratic Family Projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(2 mln:) Talk. What does your family do together that is enjoyable and relaxing, yet wholesome and beneficial? Could be damaging spiritually just to let things happen, with no planning, each one seeking out own diversion. Isn’t it true, too often family ends up in front of TV? Children enjoy projects where there is parental guidance but not total domination. This permits initiative, creativeness. Project should fit age of child. Should not be allowed to get out of hand, become too expensive, time consuming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(16 min:) Audience discussion. Why could projects, such as the following, be good for families? (1) Father goes over songs for Sunday’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study, helping children get full import. All sing. (2) Galatians 5:22, 23 read at breakfast table. One child prints name of “fruit” selected on card. Father has children watch for opportunities to show that fruitage throughout the day. At evening meal all give experience. Repeat each day or each week covering nine “fruits.” (3) Using map, a country is selected on which to report. Children take turns telling of brothers there, customs, obstacles to witnessing, ratio of publishers. (4) Family arrange trips to museum, zoo, planetarium, park, and so forth. Relate things seen to Bible, (5) Children make scrapbook from pictures in back Issues of study copies of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> If these are available. Learn to explain pictures to parents. (6) Select various features of “sign” of “time of the end.” Children collect news items as proof and store in labeled boxes.

<p><span class="font14">18 mln: Song 52. Family discusses article “Circuit Assemblies Supply What We Need.” Father discusses with family what they have done to apply what they learned from past program, thus building anticipation for coming pro-Theocratic School: becoming more effective in using Bible to give a witness; participating regularly in field service; attending all meetings and commenting; fellowshiping more, before and after meetings, and so forth. (May suggest other goals that represent points needing attention in your congregation. )</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">(3 mln:) Jesus set forth principle that person Is Identified by attitude and conduct—fruitage produced in his life. (Matt. 7:15-20) His disciples are to be identified by the love they manifest toward one another.—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(20 min:) Audience discussion. Ask audience to give spontaneous expressions on how they would define the attitudes and types of conduct mentioned in the Bible as outlined below.

As time allows, Scriptural examples and suggestions may be given to indicate how wrong attitude or conduct may be avoided or overcome. (One handling part must be familiar with Bible texts used and be able to explain meaning of words. Discuss those that may be most helpful to your congregation. You may be able to cover only three or four.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">25 min: Looking Ahead to the New Service Year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(5 min:) Talk. Reflecting on the service year just ending, it is appropriate to ask: “How much have I grown spiritually during the year? What was I able to accomplish?” Perhaps you set some personal goals by which to measure your spiritual progress. What were the results?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(15 min:) Interview publishers who made some noticeable progress during service year. Suggestions: Ones who started pioneering, shared in auxiliary pioneer service, started Bible study, progressed to baptism, enrolled in Theocratic School, started going from house to house, started commenting at meetings, improved meeting preparation, conducted regular family study, improved shepherding work (on part of elder), and so forth. Get comments from group on following points: Did you accomplish all you projected for yourselves during the year? What obstacles got in the way? What encouragement can you offer others as to the value of setting personal goals? (Make suggestions practical, realistic.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(5 min:) Summarize by pointing out the value of having personal goals. They can be an aid to progressive spiritual improvement, but should not cause discouragement or the feeling that Jehovah Is never satisfied with our progress.

<p><span class="font14">(5 min:) Talk. In starting to school soon, our children will be spending many hours each day In the presence of worldly children. This sometimes brings problems, temptations. How can we parents, elders and others help them to face these successfully? How can children fortify themselves spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(17 min:) Elder interviews group made up of two families with school-age children. (Rehearse ahead of time. If another problem prevails in your area, may substitute.) (1) When schoolmates ridicule us as Jehovah’s Witnesses, what should we do? Is this persecution? How would recalling Jesus’ words at Matthew 5:10-12 help? How are we protected by letting students know that we are one of Jeho-vah’s Witnesses right from the start? What may help ridiculers to have more respect for us? Are we losing anything if we don't gain friendship of ridiculers? (Prov. 17:17) How will ridiculers react if they see they are provoking us? If they see it doesn’t bother us? What could it lead to if we give in when ridiculed? What outcome does the Bible foretell for ridiculers? (2 Pet. 3:3, 7) (2) Use of drugs and tobacco. Is it a problem where you attend school ? Why would other children want to get you started on drugs? Could we give any Bible principles that would be violated by the use of drugs, including tobacco? (2 Cor. 7:1; Matt. 22:39; 1 Pet. 1:13; Mark 15:23) So how would God feel abou,t one of his servants taking drugs or smoking? (3) Maintaining neutrality. What is done in your school that tests a Christianas neutrality? What is the strongest reason you can think of to remain neutral? (Ex. 20:4, 5; John 17:16; 18:36)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(3 mln:) Conclude with brief exhortation for youth to remain faithful. Jehovah will help them and reward them for their faithfulness, just as he also holds them responsible for their conduct.—Eccl. 11:9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">As announced at the international conventions this summer, there will be a further adjustment in the congregation arrangement for elders. Starting with the 1979 service year (September 1, 1978), rotation will take place only with respect to the position of presiding overseer. There will be no rotation with regard to the positions of field overseer and Bible study overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This means that, for the present, elders who are currently serving as field overseer and Bible study overseer will continue in these positions until further notice. Details will be provided in the near future regarding the arrangement for each body of elders to select and recommend certain elders to serve continuously in caring for various matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As to rotating into the position of presiding overseer in September 1978, it may well be that the person next in line to serve as presiding overseer, no matter what position he holds now, can continue to serve in his present capacity temporarily and also serve as presiding overseer. If an elder feels he is not in a position to serve as presiding overseer due to health or other reasons, then the next one in line will be given the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, at their meeting in the first part of September, the body of elders should determine who should rotate into the position of presiding overseer, but all other elders should remain in their present positions, awaiting further direction. Such direction will be given in due time, so it will not be necessary to write or phone the Society about this matter.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the &quot;Youth&quot; Book in September</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The Bible indicates that the “last days” would have an adverse effect on the family unit. (2 Tim. 3:1-4; Rev. 12:12) Even theocratic families often find it a real challenge to bring up children in the faith, isn’t that so? We can be sure that many families in the world are floundering and in need of help. No doubt thousands will appreciate the help extended to them during September as we offer the book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Often young people answer the door when we call. Many in their teens appreciate it when we engage them in a conversation. And when we treat them with respect, not “talking down” to them, they often respond favorably. You might say: “I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to you because I would like to get the viewpoint of a younger person. God said something in the Bible that is especially directed to young people like yourself. [Read Ecclesiastes 12:1,] It shows that we must remember God in our youth if we want a happy future. Do you feel that a young person should be interested in God, our Creator? Does this have anything to do with our being happy? [Allow for response.] Let me show you a comment made in this book.” Turn to page 191, paragraph 15 and read the first two sentences. Then turn back to the table of contents and point out a few' of the subjects on which young ones want frank comments and help. Offer </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> book for 35c. This suggested presentation may work for you, or you may have another that you prefer to use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers have had good success by offering the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> book to young folks as they go to and </span><span class="font2">'Now Is the Acceptable Time'! </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font16">a concerted effort to search out every deserving one are still highly important.—Matt- 10:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">USE INFORMAL </span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Are you alert to opportunities to witness informally? It is having something in common with. a person that often provides just the opportunity for “a word spoken at the right time.” (Prov. 25:11) It may be easy to start a conversation with a neighbor, workmate or relative and then turn it toward the truth. For many, vacation time is an especially good time for informal witnessing. We may visit from school. It could be done much the same as magazine street work by displaying the book and speaking to passersby. Also, teachers and administrative personnel at schools can be approached. Of course, children in school have many opportunities to witness to fellow students and teachers. For example, a young witness at school in the Dominican Republic left a copy of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> book on his desk, which excited the interest of students and teachers as they would see it. The result? He placed 75 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> books in two months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> What if grown-ups or even elderly persons come to the door? Most people have children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren who mean a great deal to them. In addition to suggesting that they may wish to read the book themselves, we could tactfully suggest that they obtain it as a gift for young relatives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> In addition, carry a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font16"> book with you during September and offer it where small children are involved. There may be cases when you may wish to offer the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> book and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font16"> book in combination for 70c, such' as when there are very young children and those in their teens in the home. Our desire is to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">help people</span><span class="font16"> of all ages, and the literature is a means to this end. So during September you may feel free to use any pocket-size publication that you feel would be most beneficial to the householder. But, wherever possible, let us help young people and families to counteract the influence of Satan the Devil on family life. It has been proven that the information in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font16"> book, when applied, can do just that. Let it help you to present the good news in September.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">loved ones whom we see no other time of the year. A few ‘words at the right time’ could bring a favorable response.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Let us not forget the silent witness we give. Yes, our conduct at all times should adorn the truth, recommending it to others. After discussing Jehovah’s “acceptable time,” Paul’s next words were: “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling . . . but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.” (2 Cor. 6:3, 4) May Jehovah bless our efforts to help others see that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">NOW</span><span class="font16"> is the “especially acceptable time” for'.salvation!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">A number of congregations had a fine response to the auxiliary pioneer service during the spring months. For example, the Bradley Beach, New Jersey, Congregation, with 133 publishers associated, had 62 auxiliary pioneers in April. Their circuit overseer reports that the elders and ministerial servants organized meetings for service throughout each day and in the evenings so that all would have companionship, and all enjoyed a happy month in Jehovah's service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During March, Togo reported a new peak of 2,660 publishers. This is a fine report from this small West African conn-try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite continued turmoil in the land, Cyprus reported a new peak in March of 878 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V February saw the third time this service year that Luxembourg reached a new peak in publishers, with 859 reporting. Home Bible studies also reached a new peak, with 573 being conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">+ The African country of Mali reached a new peak, with 35 publishers reporting. Congregation publishers averaged 21.5 hours and conducted 55 home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Watchtower Farms, 111 of the 630 members of the family shared in the auxiliary pioneer work in April, The family rejoiced that so many of their number could enjoy this privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joy in Talking About Jehovah (Cotlf’d) </span><span class="font16">42. When Jesus sent out the seventy disciples, likely some were apprehensive, but they “returned with joy” and related their experiences.—Luke 10:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> Such joy can be yours also when you succeed in getting someone to listen to your presentation of the good news. If someone agrees to study the Bible with you, or responds to your invitation to attend Christian meetings, your heart will indeed rejoice. The apostle Paul expressed his joy in those he had helped in spite of much difficulty and under the most trying circumstances.—1 Thess. 2:9. 19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>a</sup> Yes, joy does indeed come from talking about Jehovah. The planting, watering and cultivating of the seeds of truth may require much effort on your part, but the good results that come from talking about Jehovah are bound to bring you joy.—Ps. 126:5, 6.</span></p>

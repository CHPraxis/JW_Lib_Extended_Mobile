<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Dea/t <sup>&lt;</sup>EKingcfom </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">^Mishehs:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font15"> here at Bethel have certainly enjoyed attending one of the 20 “Victorious Faith” International Conventions throughout the United States. It was most encouraging to be present at various places with so many of you, friends both old and new, from far and near. You will be pleased to know that in the continental United States there was a peak attendance of 785,051 and 5,539 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The conventions have provided us with much to think about, haven’t they? The field service Friday morning was also a delight. Indeed, “the one whom people put in charge of much, they will demand more than usual of him,” and so it was most fitting that talks during the morning and afternoon sessions of one entire day were devoted to considering the needs of the elders, who number about 45,000 in this country.—Luke 12:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Elders especially appreciated the kindly admonition to keep examining themselves as to their attitude toward their assignment, their spirituality and the example they set in the evangelizing work, matters of morality and firmness for right principles. One of them said: “Wednesday’s program was for me. Now I can see how to perform all my duties and be balanced as a person and family head.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Were you not encouraged to learn that almost 28,000 were baptized in the United States last year and 273,000 studies were conducted each month? We are glad to have these new ones in our midst. While we were reminded that all of us can share in aiding them, we can readily see the big responsibility that elders have in this area where they can demonstrate their genuine care and concern for the flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We were happy to hear that 60 percent of one congregation in Colorado and 59 people in a con-</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">■r</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> In discussing the subject of faith, James asked: “You believe there is one God, do you?” He then said: “You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder.” (Jas. 2:19) The Greek word for “to believe” is the same as “to put faith in.” —Jas. 2:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Thus, the demons believe there is a God and are in fear of him, but they have not obeyed him. Likewise, even though we believe in God, if we do not obey God, such a “faith apart from works is inactive.” (Jas. 2:20) Our faith should be like Abraham’s, which was perfected by his works.—Jas. 2:21, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMONSTRATE FAITH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> In October we want to demonstrate our living faith by works in the field service. To aid us, Jehovah has generously provided an effective instrument to use in the subscription campaign—the October 8 issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> with the captivating theme: “A Book That Can Put Bread on Your Table.” (See Presenting the Good News.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Despite good intentions, we can become irregular in our field service activity. How can we avoid this potential pitfall? By imitating Jehovah. James describes Jehovah as “the Father of the celestial lights,”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Have You Tried a</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> During October we are offering the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> subscription from house to house, and we are sure that many will be interested in taking a subscription. However, for various reasons some persons prefer not to subscribe and yet may show interest in our magazines. What could we do then? Why not try starting a magazine route by returning in a week or two with the latest issues?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Surely we want to be regular proclaimers of the good news, do we not? Regularity in service strengthens our faith and develops our effectiveness. And here is one advantage of a magazine route. We find that every week or every two weeks the one with a magazine route gets out on a regular basis to deliver the magazines to those on his route. And often two publishers can work together, the more experienced one assisting and training the one with less experience in the field. Thus the route really helps </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font15"> publishers to be regular and effective proclaimers of the Kingdom good news!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Another benefit of a magazine route is that personal calls are made on people regularly. Even with whom “there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.” (Jas. 1:17) He is a God of order, unchangeableness, and dependability. In order to get things done at home, in school and on our secular jobs we adhere to a regular routine. There is no question about the wisdom of having things scheduled. We can follow Jehovah’s orderly example by establishing a </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">weekly schedule</span><span class="font15"> that sets aside definite periods of time to show our faith by works in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> For example, in October why not work out a family schedule that allows you to share in the field service for three hours or more a week, or, if possible, to auxiliary pioneer? Being an auxiliary pioneer would mean spending, on the average, only two hours daily helping those in our territory spiritually. Some brothers and sisters auxiliary pioneer often, some every month. One brother recently wrote the Society: “Auxiliary pioneering has given me a new appreciation of the field service. I’m more careful to follow through on interest located and I am much more effective in helping people. Auxiliary pioneering has really helped me to enter more fully into the spirit of harvesting.”—Matt. 9:35-38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Magazine Route?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">though the witness given might be brief, seeds of truth are being sown on each call. An alert publisher soon knows which calls merit follow-up, and many publishers and pioneers find this an excellent way to start new home Bible studies. So a good magazine route not only helps to get the magazines placed but also helps to locate truly sheeplike persons so that we can assist them to become disciples of Christ, too.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers find it advantageous to start a magazine route with shopkeepers and store clerks. In this way they are able to do store-to-store work on a regular basis and briefly witness to busy persons who may not hear about the truth in any other way.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>B</sup> Do you find your magazines stacking up at times? A regular magazine route certainly helps in getting our journals into the hands of readers, as you are taking the magazines to persons who know the type of material they contain and are glad to have them brought to their homes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">15 min: &quot;Demonstrate a Living Faith.” (Handled by field overseer.) If necessary, elders meet prior to this part to arrange times for held service in October in order to inform publishers at this meeting. Question-and-answer discussion. Look up and discuss texts cited. Have publishers prepared to relate how one's schedule might be arranged so as to spend more time in field service during October. If some are able to auxiliary pioneer, let them briefly relate how they are able to schedule their time. Inform all of meetings for field service scheduled at times practical for pioneers, auxiliary pioneers and publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Know Your Magazine, (Encourage each one to have a copy of the October 8 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!)</span><span class="font13"> Cover interesting highlights, illustrations and talking points that publishers can use while working in the field, helping others to build up their faith in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">“Presenting the Good News —By Emphasizing the Bible's Practical Value.” Develop presentations with audience and thereafter demonstrate each one. In connection with each presentation, let publishers express what appeals to them. Make the part practical and helpful. We want to be effective in our faith-building work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font13">min: Song 76 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theme: Our Place of Worship.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font13">min: Song 5. Branch Letter.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font13">Supporting the House of True Worship. Talk and Scriptural discussion with audience of the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1, Congregations of Jehovah’s people today look to Kingdom Hall as house of true worship. Building not considered as sacred, yet given special position and honor due to use in Jehovah's worship. Need for all to support Kingdom Hall in various ways. Can look to ancient Jewish nation as an example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. Tabernacle constructed in wilderness in 1512 B.C.E. Materials were required; Israelites volunteered more than enough.—Ex. 36:3, 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. Tabernacle replaced later by temple in Jerusalem. King David gave from his personal fortune to support temple construction under Solomon’s supervision.—1 Chron, 22:14; 29:3-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. More than initial construction support required. Repairs and cleansing needed at times. (2 Chron. 29:3, 15, 16) Continual support of temple worship was required.—Neh. 13:9-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">5. Those who supported God’s house had his blessing. (Mal. 3:10) Took time, effort, finances, but all went to support true, worship of Jehovah God, to magnify his name. All in congregations today should be willing workers as faithful Israelites were. Our Kingdom Halls should be focal point of ■true worship in each community. We should all support this house of true worship. How? Not only by attending meetings, but also by contributing our time, energies, finances and skills to make and keep our Kingdom Halls presentable. Each Kingdom Hall should be well maintained inside and out and thus be a silent witness to the name of Jehovah. We should be proud of our Kingdom Halls, happy to invite people to come there for Christian association and Bible study. Jehovah will bless us as we give of our “firstfruits” to support his worship today.—Prov. 3:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">“Is Your Kingdom Hall Presentable?” (Handled by presiding overseer.) Question-and-answer discussion with application of points to needs of the local Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Our Kingdom Hall Needs. Talk by elder. Some Kingdom Halls may need painting or rather extensive work that will take a week or two or longer. Outline what the elders discussed and suggested to improve the Kingdom Hall’s appearance, (The Society is not making Kingdom Hall loans at this time. Costs for repairs must be financed locally.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some congregations have a relatively new hall that may only need a thorough cleaning. It may be that a nearby congregation has much to do to improve their hall. Why not analyze your circumstances to determine if you can be of assistance? Elders can cooperate with one another in working out the details and arranging help through the elders. If possible, would it not be good to organize for the Kingdom Hall work this month or the next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If some will spend considerable time on Kingdom Hall work, encourage others to share more fully in field service to make up for the time some will be working on the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Song 8 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 15 </span><span class="font13">Theme: Use the Magazines in Evangelizing Work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 4 and announcements. Then brief discussion to show urgent need for people to learn truth to cope with family and marriage problems. God's Word shows root cause of problems and also proper remedy. (Prov. 3:5, 6) Our magazines will help to direct people to God’s Word and God’s remedy for family problems. (Chairman can here interview two or three prepared publishers. Ask: What points in recent issues have you found practical and useful in field service?) Conclude by showing which articles are practical and helpful for field service. Encourage use of magazines in all features of our evangelizing work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">13 min: “Have You Tried a Magazine Route?” Question-and-answer discussion of article with congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: How to Develop Magazine Routes. Consider following points with audience and draw out answers:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. House-to-house record. Why should we use it to record interest and magazine placements?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. What should we say about our calling again to one who takes the magazines? (Get practical suggestions on laying groundwork for future calls. Include thought that new issues of magazines are available every week with interesting, thought-provoking articles.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. As we return with new issues, what approach might be helpful to get route established? (Emphasize knowing the magazines well, reading them first. Have several talking points to use. Try to determine what might appeal to certain people in territory.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. When should we go on a magazine route? (Include suggestions from audience. Some may go on Saturday or Sunday after regular field service. Others prefer late afternoons or evenings when they find more at home. Some publishers go on routes as they travel or walk to or from congregation meetings.) Chairman can point out value of regular contact with people in territory through magazine route calls, and then conclude part.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Interview publishers who have good success in field service and who are effective in placing magazines. (Include one or two elders who are taking a good lead in field service.) What do they find appeals to people in local territory? What are various ways that magazines may be placed other than direct approach, such as informal witnessing? Do elders feel that the magazines are helpful in their evangelizing work? How? Have younger publishers found articles in magazines helpful in speaking to other students or to teachers? Have any studies been started in territory as a direct result of magazine placements? (Encourage this way to make disciples!) Conclude by encouraging all to consider their personal schedule for evangelizing work and the possibilities for arranging more time to help people in local territory to gain a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theme: Examining Our Personal Relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 35 and local announcements. Briefly mention theme of meeting and how each part relates to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font13">Our Relationship with Jehovah. Question-and-answer discussion of following material. Encourage audience to bring out what they see in examples cited that can help us to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah and to make our service to him a source of joy and blessing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. Consider Proverbs 17:17. Why do some friendships develop with time and others just dwindle away? A good relationship is not static; constant effort is needed to maintain it &quot;all the time.' ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. What direction has your personal relationship with Jehovah taken since the time of your dedication? (Heb. 10:9) Many feel things have become routine, done merely out of duty or habit. What can we do to strengthen and improve our relationship with Jehovah and to rekindle the warmth and zeal we had for him?—Heb. 10:32-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. What earned Abraham the privilege of being called “Jehovah’s friend”? Consider James 2:21-23. Abraham not only did what he knew he should; he was </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">responsive</span><span class="font13"> to Jehovah’s every direction, always </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">looking</span><span class="font13"> for opportunities to demonstrate his willingness and obedience, thus endeavoring to please Him.—Heb. 11:8-10, 14-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. Abraham’s understanding of Jehovah’s viewpoint and his reflecting it in his own dealings with others contributed further to his good relationship with Jehovah. Consider Genesis 18:22-33. Abraham clearly understood Jehovah’s ways, his justice and compassion, his willingness to listen to lowly, imperfect creatures. Genesis 13: 8, 9 shows Abraham reflected same qualities in settling dispute with Lot, His course of action clearly was pleasing to Jehovah, thus strengthening the relationship between them.—Gen. 13: 14-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">5. Read and discuss Micah 7:18-20. When we center our lives and activities </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Service Meetings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">around our relationship with Jehovah, we will come to know and experience the fullness of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and mercy. What a grand privilege to have such a relationship with Jehovah God!—Ps. 84:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font13">Benefiting from Abraham’s Example. Talk with audience discussion, based on theme of meeting and material discussed in previous part. To be handled by a qualified elder who will first review circuit overseer's comments in last Report on Circuit Overseer’s Visit with Congregation under section dealing with the spiritual condition and needs of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As Abraham received many directions from Jehovah and faithfully carried them out, we have the command to preach the “good news’’ and make disciples, to “hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering,’’ and to “consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.’’ (Matt. 28:19, 20; Heb. 10: 23-25) Do we view such directions from Jehovah the same way that Abraham did—as opportunities to demonstrate our love and devotion to Jehovah and thus strengthen our relationship with him? Or, have they become a burden, an obligation to us? If so, analyze what the obstacles are and what can be done to overcome them. How can elders help? Similarly, do we feel enthused about participation in meetings,-actively contributing to them? What can help us to do sb? How can elders and others who have parts on meetings help? We can imitate Abraham and seize every opportunity that our circumstances afford, to carry out what we know is well-pleasing to Jehovah. —Eph. 5:15-17; Ps. 26:12; 66:13; 122:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We can also benefit from Abraham’s example by reflecting Jehovah’s qualities in our daily activities and our dealings with others, thus drawing ourselves closer to Him. The spirit of the world is to compete and win and get the best for oneself at the expense of others. (Gal. 5:26) Those who follow such a course alienate themselves from God and become his enemies rather than his friends. (Col. 1:21) We must resist any such tendencies on our part. Another factor that can easily undermine our relationship with Jehovah is the spirit of independence that caused Adam and Eve to take the course of rebellion that resulted in sin and death for the entire human family. (Rom. 5:12) Then, particularly in areas in which our Christian conscience is involved, our response and the action we take will directly affect our relationship with God. (1 Tim. 1:19; 1 Pet. 2:19. 20) Invite audience to comment on how, and in what areas, we can imitate Abraham in reflecting Jehovah’s qualities in our daily life and dealings with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Conclude by encouraging all to treasure our personal relationship with Jehovah God and to put forth sincere effort to strengthen and improve it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font13">Close meeting with song 91 and prayer. (Pass out a copy of the new tract </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(KN</span><span class="font13"> 26) to each person. Encourage all to read tract and bring to next meeting.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Theme: Relief from Pressure—How? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 21 and announcements. (During song pass out tracts to those who do not have them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Pressures on People Today. Talk and audience discussion of tract cover and page 2. Ask questions and let audience comment on various pressures people in general must endure. Cover each point illustrated, applying points</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Your Kingdom Holl Presentable?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> What a joy we experience when in our travels we see a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Here is where a congregation of our brothers meet! We note the appearance of the Kingdom Hall and are happy when its appearance is presentable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The Kingdom Hall is likely the only building in the community that has Jehovah’s name on it. It is identified as a place where Jehovah’s name people meet together. Appreciation of this should make us very conscious of maintaining the Kingdom Hall in good condition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Is your Kingdom Hall’s appearance a credit to the work? Each one of us should be vitally interested in its appearance. All of us are involved. How can we help?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> On the outside of the Kingdom Hall, we might first look at the sidewalk and street. If paper and debris accumulate, would it not be good to have some arrangements to do necessary cleaning up for a few minutes before and after the meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Is the grass regularly cut? Is the outside appearance of the building itself neat and clean, properly representing the clean and pure worship of Jehovah? Special attention should be given to the outside appearance of the main entrance, since this is especially noticed by any who pass by. What about the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">to local circumstances. What are some facts showing the effect of pressure? What are pressures we must personally face? Do pressures seem to be getting greater ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font13">Relief from Pressure. (Timing of parts is approximate and may be adjusted in keeping with local needs.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(10 min:) Discussion, looking up and applying scriptures. Paul was convinced of the value of his service. He realized it could result in life to others. (2 Cor. 4:1, 2) Effort and sacrifice on his part were required. Appreciating what God had done for him moved him to speak from his heart to others, as did the psalmist whom he quoted. (Ps. 116:10; 2 Cor. 4:13) God has helped each of us through many distressing circumstances and we can depend on him to help us in the future. Moved by a heart filled with appreciation, we will speak to others, helping them to see that the Bible has the answers to the problems brought on by pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(10 min:) Discuss pages 3 and 4.

Is it neat and well kept, with good lighting, if necessary? Are the times of the meetings listed correctly? A clean, pleasant Kingdom Hall invites, yes, welcomes people to come and listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>c</sup> The inside of the Kingdom Hall should also enhance the message being presented. Is the interior neat and clean? Well arranged? Is seating adequate? What about the ventilation? Are rest rooms clean and well supplied with towels, toilet tissue and soap? Are the fixtures in working order? Do you help your group when it is assigned to clean the Kingdom Hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> All of us should not only be conscious of the Kingdom Hall’s inside and outside appearance, but should also be willing to help out as needed. We do well to appreciate that the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses should at all times be an honor and praise to Jehovah’s name, and we should gladly do our part in keeping it in a condition that results in a favorable impression.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Here is a suggested presentation: “Hello. We’re calling because of our interest in our neighbors. Most people today work very hard to make a living and to feed and clothe a family, don’t they? And that is becoming more difficult, isn’t it? Did you know that there is a book that can help us to provide for our needs, that can improve our lot in life? Jesus taught us to pray for our daily bread, for the things we need. Applying certain Bible principles can actually help us to provide for our families. Notice what Isaiah 48:17 says about the Author of the Bible. [Read.] Yes, the God of the Bible teaches us to benefit ourselves in our everyday living.” Direct their attention to an interesting point in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> magazine, and make the offer.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE THE LEAD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Peter encouraged older men to become examples to the flock. (1 Pet. 5:3) During October, as elders and ministerial servants zealously take the lead in the field service and joyfully work with their fellow publishers, the congregation will imitate their faith. When an elder apologized for not being able to work with a sister due to his working with others and time running-out, she said: “That is okay. I could see you working across the street and that was enough for me.” The body of elders will organize field service activity for the congregation so that everyone can share as fully as possible in declaring his faith. In this way we will be used by Jehovah to help save the lives of deserving ones whom we search out. The month of October affords all of us an excellent opportunity to prove that our living faith in Jehovah moves us to become ‘doers of the work,’ which results in happiness.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li></ul>

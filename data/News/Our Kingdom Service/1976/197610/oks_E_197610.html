<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;</sup>xK.tftgdoM</span><span class="font10"> ^pctMisk/iS:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the thirty-ninth time that Jehovah’s servants have had the privilege and the opportunity to share in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> subscription campaign. This magazine that presents the truth regarding creation, religion, the practical sciences and other points of human interest has not always been called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brother C. T. Russell had for some time contemplated a publication of this kind, but it wasn’t until 1919, three years after his death, that it became a reality. On September 5 of that year, the 6,000 assembled at the first Cedar Point, Ohio, convention were thrilled to hear that this new magazine, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> would soon be published. What was the response? Over 15,000 subscriptions were received before the first issue was ever published. Volume one, number one of this semimonthly magazine was dated October 1, 1919, and the subscription rate was $1.50 a year, or ten cents a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the October 6, 1937, issue, on the eighteenth anniversary of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> the magazine took on a new appearance, and its name was changed to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font8">and remained such for the next nine years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was on August 6, 1946, at the “Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly” in Cleveland, Ohio, not far from Cedar Point, that a vast crowd of 55,000 was introduced to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> which now has reached over ten million copies average printing for each issue. But the original symbol “g” (for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age)</span><span class="font8"> still identifies </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> as in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine has played an important role in keeping people informed on the vital issues of the day and in whetting their spiritual appetites for the deeper things of God’s Word.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a Bible Study?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Would you like to conduct a Bible study? All of us should, inasmuch as giving is a vital part of Christianity, and what better way is there to give? A Bible study is the means by which most people learn the truth.—Ps. 145:15b; Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> You may be one who does not conduct a Bible study. Perhaps you started in field service offering the tracts and are branching out into using the Bible from house ’ to house, and you now wonder, “How can I start a home Bible study?” Well, few people ask us to conduct Bible studies with them. You will usually have to take the initiative and offer to conduct it. But with whom?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> How about your friends and relatives? Could it be that some of them would study the Bible with you rather than with a stranger? Have you asked them? Also, many congregations are having more than a 100-percent attendance at their Kingdom Hall meetings. Who are these additional people? Have they all had the benefit of a home Bible study? If you have reason to feel</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart do you good in the days of your young manhood.” Yes, as Solomon says, youth is usually a time of many happy experiences and it is good to find pleasure in these. Youthful vigor and strength would naturally contribute toward a cheerful outlook. But also to be considered are Solomon’s further words of counsel to those who might thoughtlessly follow a course of pleasing only themselves: “So remove vexation from your heart, and ward off calamity from your flesh; for youth and the prime of life are vanity.” However, “calamity” and “vexation” need not be your portion. The Bible clearly outlines what you can do to prepare for a full and worthwhile adult life, and how you can serve Jehovah effectively, though young, while thus preparing.—Eccl. 11:9-12:1; Prov. 2:1-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Preparing for a lifetime of serving Jehovah is similar to preparing for any other career. Having your goal in mind early in life is best. It helps to eliminate waste of effort and time. So, it is not good to say in effect “I’ll begin to think that some haven’t, why not talk to them? Many fine studies have had their origin right in the Kingdom Hall in this way. There may be those in the congregation who have more Bible studies and prospective studies than they themselves can handle. Perhaps there are publishers like this in your congregation who would be pleased to help you start a home Bible study of your own. Why not try asking? You could ask any in the congregation who seem to be having good success in this work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> You could also talk to the Bible study overseer so that he will have in mind your desire to be useful in this way. Sometimes studies are referred to him by other publishers or through the Society, and he may be able to assist you. Why not ask? Of course, if the name of an interested person is given to you, you will want to remember that it is a serious responsibility that you now have. To a great extent that person’s opportunity for life has been put into your hands. Follow through with diligence so as really to develop that interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">seriously about serving Jehovah when I get a little older.” No, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">now </span><span class="font8">is the time to do so!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The attitude of some youths today is to work just to enjoy as many worldly pleasures and material things as possible. Adults who have the most materially are looked up to and copied. But Jesus said “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” (Matt. 6:33) Keeping one’s mind on spiritual matters in youth will spare one from spending time on fruitless pursuits.—1 Tim. 6:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONAL PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> A servant of God should learn to read and to speak well. This is necessary if one is to be able to read and understand the Bible, the Society’s publications, other printed matter, and carry on correspondence. This is one of the most important aids in coming to an accurate knowledge of the truth and thereafter being able to talk to others about it. Preparing for and participating in the meetings will be a tremendous help in this direc-</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">Song 32. Announcements, stressing care in handling subscriptions. Read Psalm 2:11, 12. Show need to stay in our refuge under God’s kingdom, inviting others to do the same. Isaiah 32:1, 2, 17, 18 describes the peace and security of those who are brought into the spiritual paradise. Identify the “princes” and show how they contribute to the restful conditions of the paradise. (See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> 10/1/75, pages 604, 605, paragraphs 1-5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">Helping Others to Wake Up. During October we will be seeking to start Scriptural discussions in our door-to-door work, using the Bible whenever possible. When we get a listening ear we will be glad to explain to the householder the benefits of regularly reading the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and show now it can be obtained. (See Announcements for details of offer.) The October 8 issue will be a special one discussing the subject “Will Serving God Solve Your Problems?” Chairman can discuss with audience an article or scripture from this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> that might be especially appropriate in local territory so as to involve the householder in a discussion. Have well-prepared demonstration of a brief, simple presentation built around Psalm 146:3 and 37:9-11 showing that men cannot solve our problems, but God can and will. However, publishers can use any Scriptural presentation they have found successful recently. You might use the illustration on the cover. Or you might turn inside to the article that deals with family life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font7">“The Pioneer’s Part in Gathering More of the ‘Great Crowd.’ ” Consider first half of insert on pioneer work, down to subheading “Encourage Pioneers.” Do this by questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font7">“Have You Offered to Conduct a Bible Study?” Talk, but draw audience into discussion appropriately. Song 113. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Good Use of Our Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">Song 31. Discuss how the printed page has been used in “the time of the end” to spread the good news far and wide. Early Christians didn’t even have a personal copy of Bible for study or witnessing. We now have complete Bible in printed form, in variety of translations; especially appreciated is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font7"> (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Jehovah is fulfilling promise given at Matthew 24:45-47 to have “faithful and discreet slave” bring us needed “food at the proper time.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> for 1976, page 22, paragraph 4, shows extent to which literature used world wide in past year. Glad to study it and to place it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font7">Branch Letter. Talk, drawing audience into discussion occasionally. Mention that October 15 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> is a special issue, and offer some suggestions for presenting it in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font7">Have accounts report read and bring in any local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">W’hy Do We Appreciate Our Literature? Interview a number of publishers as to why they appreciate the various publications supplied to us by the “faithful and discreet slave.” Might ask questions such as: How long have you been reading the Society's literature? What especially attracted you to the publications when you first became interested? What do you do in order to arrange adequate time for reading? What is it that you particularly appreciate about the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!? </span><span class="font7">What will you especially try to put across to the householder during October in describing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">“Making Good Use of Our Literature.” Questions and answers. While discussing appropriate use of literature chairman can extend a warm invitation to publishers to share in field service at congregation’s group field service arrangements. Song 7. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font7">Song 27. Theocratic News. Local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font7">Question Box, talk. Presiding overseer might handle this, drawing audience into discussion at appropriate points. Chairman will want to read carefully Question Box in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> of January and February 1975 so that he can present </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> clear picture regarding which brothers might be used in various program assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font7">“Presenting the Good News— At Each Appropriate Opportunity.” First consider entire article by means of questions and answers and then use remaining time to hear brief experiences from audience of how some have taken advantage of various opportunities to give a witness. Would be good to arrange experiences in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font7">“The Pioneer’s Part in Gathering More of the ‘Great Crowd.’ ” Begin at subheading “Encourage Pioneers” and complete the insert. Discuss with audience by means of well-prepared questions. Express appreciation for local pioneers—special, regular and auxiliary. Remind congregation of some things that might help and encourage local pioneers, such as, assistance with transportation, working with them in the field service, and so forth. Song </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">8. </span><span class="font7">Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 24 Serve Jehovah in Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font7">Song 23. Introductory comments. Any needed local announcements. Suggest all publishers familiarize themselves with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font7"> book in preparation for November field service, selecting points to use in presentations. Plans for distributing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font7">“Serve Jehovah in Your Youth.” Discuss with audience by means of well-prepared questions. Look up, read and discuss as many cited</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">benefiting from its pages personally but also zealously offering it to the public, especially during the annual subscription campaigns. During the first campaign, April-June 1938, 30,000 publishers obtained 73,006 subscriptions. What a fine witness would result if during the month of October each one of us could help someone to subscribe so that they could appreciate more fully the value of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of us look forward to good success in this campaign, with the rich blessing of Jehovah upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brothers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font7">scriptures as time permits, asking audience to make application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">Our Brothers Who Started Serving Jehovah in Youth. Interview a number of publishers who started serving Jehovah in youth. These can be either young publishers who have recently started serving or older publishers who have served for years but started as youths. Might ask questions such as: When did you begin serving Jehovah? How did you get the truth? What especially moved you to begin sharing in the field service? Do you recall what others, worldly friends and brothers, said at the time and how this affected you? What recommendations would you make to young Witnesses today ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">“Like Slips of Olive Trees All Around My Table?’ From </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">of June 1, 1976. Chairman should study article carefully in preparation. Can narrate introductory material briefly and then select those paragraphs that you feel would be especially beneficial in your congregation, have them read first and then invite audience to comment, making application, indicating what they feel is to be learned from the experience. Song 60. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Conduct a Bible Study </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Another source of Bible studies that continues to be fruitful is the contacts we make through our regular preaching work. But here again, in order to start a study we usually have to take the initiative. One sister had this drawn to her attention when making one of her regular magazine route calls. The woman was always friendly and took the magazines, but a Bible study was never mentioned. One day when making the call the sister discovered after knocking on the door that she didn’t have any magazines left. As the door opened, she could think of only one thing to do—offer the woman a home Bible study. The householder readily accepted and a fine study resulted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Conducting Bible studies is a joyful work. It does take a little organizing, however, setting aside time in our schedule each week. But the rewards make the effort worth while. Why not experience this joy for yourself? Equipped as we are with the Bible and other publications, it is not difficult. During this month we will place subscriptions and we have </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> golden opportunity to start studies using the booklets. Select the booklet you will use and plan what you will say. Good suggestions appeared in the January 1976 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span><span class="font8"> We do not have to use the word “study,” but we can enter into a discussion using the booklet and in this way help someone to learn what is in the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Pioneer's Part in Gathering More of the &quot;Great Crowd''</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">iifTlHIS pioneer is most certainly a good rep-</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">|</span><span class="font8"> resentative for Jehovah. He is devoted, loyal, and shows heartfelt concern for others. Not only is he loved and respected by the local congregation, but by all in the circuit. His entire life centers around Kingdom interests.” This was the comment of a circuit overseer concerning an elder who had served as a pioneer for twenty-five years.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> A twenty-two-year-old sister writes, “I am writing to express to you my love for the pioneer service and the desire I have to branch out in serving Jehovah. Knowing that the days are wicked and indeed short I have come to realize that all people should hear of Jehovah and his kingdom. Doing this now while I am young has brought many blessings. Now I am into my year-and-a-half of regular pioneering and during that time my love has deepened for spiritual things.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> What is it that moves Kingdom publishers, such as these two, to enter the pioneer service, make it their life’s work and find such joy in it? It is their deep love for Jehovah, and their heartfelt desire to help others to learn the way to life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> They are acquainted with the description of the “great crowd” that the apostle John gives at Revelation 7:9, now being gathered, and they want to share fully in gathering others into that blessed group. They know that it was Jehovah’s blessing on diligent preaching and teaching that enabled over two million persons to take a firm stand on His side in this time of the end, and they further realize that it is by this same work that Jehovah will bring in others to whom he is now showing mercy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Yes, there is every evidence that the “great crowd” is getting larger. While in some countries the increase might be considered as modest, in others, people are accepting the truth in great numbers. Jehovah, in his loving kindness, is holding the way open for many more of the unnumbered “great crowd” to say, “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:10) It is a time for happiness, a time to be industrious, engaging in the joyous work of rescuing other interested persons from Satan’s grasp and lovingly teaching them the Bible principles that will lead to God’s approval, qualifying them for New Order living.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> There is much evidence that there are many honest-hearted ones in our own home territories who want to learn about Jehovah and his righteous purposes. For example, circuit and district overseers report that as they work in different parts of the country they are finding many interested ones and starting studies with them. They say that other experienced publishers, who work with a goal of starting studies, are doing the same. Note the comments of six traveling overseers regarding starting studies: “Qualified publishers are able to obtain Bible studies if they work at it.” “Many are still starting Bible studies in the house-to-house work. Those who are successful in starting studies are those who are really conscientious about their service and who make the starting of studies their real goal.” “Most publishers who work for studies have no problem starting studies, though not necessarily on the initial call. Some have limits as to how many they can conduct.” “I find I can start twenty to thirty Bible studies a month. At least half of them are with persons who have no literature.” “Studies are no more difficult to start today than in the past, in some ways easier.” “I feel that for the most part, more people are taking interest in the truth than in times past. This will vary, however, from one area to another.” Yes, there are still many people like Lydia, who responded when hearing the good news as preached by Paul. Jehovah “opened her heart” and she accepted the truth.—Acts 16:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> How each of us will share in the gathering of more of this “great crowd” will depend on our circumstances. Some with family and other responsibilities will need to serve as congregation publishers, though serving with the same love and zeal as others. Some will be able to serve as auxiliary pioneers, while others will be in a position to serve as regular pioneers. If your personal circumstances would allow you to be a pioneer, how do you feel about it? If you are free to be a pioneer, then why not take a fresh look at this privilege and see if what is said here applies to you?</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PIONEER WORK</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> The new arrangements for the regular pioneer work will make it possible for a number of pioneers who are having difficulty in meeting the 100-hour requirement each month to continue on in the service they so much love. For a number of these, the 1,200-hour-per-year requirement has not been easy and it is appreciated how these devoted brothers and sisters have worked diligently to continue on as pioneers. Now the regular pioneers have a goal of 90 hours each month and it is hoped the major part of that time can be used in house-to-house preaching and making return visits. By reaching this goal of 90 hours a month, it would be possible to have a total of 1,080 hours for the year. However, some of this time may be used for attending two circuit assemblies and one district assembly as well as enjoying a vacation period, if desired. So a total of just 1,000 hours a year instead of 1,200 hours </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">will be required</span><span class="font8"> for one to stay on the regular pioneer list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Besides those already on the pioneer list who will be benefited, there will be others who have had a keen desire to be pioneers but who have found that the hour requirement was more than they could reach. So they have hesitated to start out in the pioneer work, fearing that they might not be able to hold to the schedule and would, after a time, have to ask to be deleted. Likely, many of these zealous ' publishers will now see their way clear to devote 90 hours a month to the field activity, especially with the assurance that they will not need to discontinue the pioneer work at the end of the service year as long as they can report </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">at least 1,000 hours for the year. </span><span class="font8">These reduced requirements take into account the financial and other pressures that many are experiencing due to inflation and related factors, and will make it possible for one to serve Jehovah as a pioneer with a greater assurance of success. We confidently expect that many will take up the pioneer work in view of these new arrangements. It amounts to averaging just three hours each day in Kingdom service.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>IS THE AUXILIARY PIONEER WORK WITHIN YOUR REACH?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There was great rejoicing when the auxiliary pioneer service was announced. Here was what many felt they could attain as a goal of Kingdom service. There are undoubtedly many who will be able to enroll in the auxiliary pioneer work. This replaces the temporary pioneer work and so you will recognize that some of the requirements remain the same. For example, one must be baptized and have a reputation for good Christian conduct. One enrolls, not by writing to the Society, but rather, this is handled entirely in your own congregation. The presiding overseer will have the applications and it is good to get one and fill it out well in advance of the date you want to begin. The old forms can be used until the new forms are available. The committee will have the responsibility to consider it and decide if the applicant qualifies. The requirement of hours, sixty per month, should put this fine privilege within the reach of many congregation publishers who heretofore have had a strong desire to enroll but whose circumstances would not permit it. Now, if a person can devote just two hours a day to the field service, he can have the joy of sharing in the auxiliary pioneer work. This can be shared in for just one month at a time, but undoubtedly there will be a number who will want to be auxiliary pioneers on a continual basis. These pioneers will be able to obtain magazines and place subscriptions at pioneer rates, but will pay the congregation publisher rate on other literature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> For whom is the auxiliary pioneer work meant? It is for those who have the zeal and desire to serve Jehovah more fully. Some would like to serve as regular pioneers but do not have the time, circumstances or the strength for it. They do, however, have the pioneer spirit. They have the love for Jehovah and their fellow humans and want to serve them. Truly, they have many blessings in store for them as they apply themselves in a whole-souled way to this new arrangement that just fits their needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> Some who will share in the auxiliary pioneer work will be housewives. Many sisters, by organizing their household duties well, will find it easily within the range of possibility to enroll. Especially will this be true of those without children to care for, or who do not need to engage in secular work. Older brothers who work only part time or who are retired will find this a rewarding way to serve. Some will be able to serve during worldly holiday seasons or might be able to put forth a special effort to enroll when the circuit overseer comes to visit the congregation. Schoolchildren who can set aside a month or more during their summer vacation can be auxiliary pioneers. Many others will discover that there will be a month or so at some time during the year when unexpected circumstances will allow them, with a little planning, to enjoy this grand privilege.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ENCOURAGE PIONEERS</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>13</sup> Should the entire congregation be interested in the pioneer work? Indeed it should! All in the congregation can be an encouragement to pioneers and also to those who are thinking of entering the pioneer work. When the Israelites returned from captivity in Babylon and started to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem a number of factors combined to dishearten them. They needed encouragement! So Jehovah raised up the prophet Haggai who exhorted them to move ahead regardless of the obstacles, adding that Jehovah had said, “I am with you people.” The account continues, “And Jehovah proceeded to rouse up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Sheal-tiel, the governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of all the remaining ones of the people; and they began to enter in and to do the work in the house of Jehovah of armies their God.” (Haggai 1:13, 14) Let us follow the example of Jehovah and Haggai and be a real encouragement to the pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> Elders and ministerial servants, by what they do and say, can certainly encourage the pioneer work. It is good when they themselves have the pioneer spirit, whether they are in a position to be pioneers or not. Thus they can help others to avoid developing a materialistic view and cultivate, instead, theocratic goals. Words from the elders that are positive and encouraging can build up and spiritually strengthen as did Paul’s words to Timothy, “I never leave off remembering you in my supplications, night and day longing to see you . . . For I recollect the faith which is in you without any hypocrisy, and which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, but which I am confident is also in you. For this very cause I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you.”—2 Tim. 1:3-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup> Parents, too, can do a great deal to direct the hearts of their children toward the pioneer work. Those parents who share wholeheartedly in the field service and who enroll in the auxiliary pioneer work whenever possible set a fine example for their children to follow. Many of our best pioneers have come from those whose parents set before them the goal of the pioneer work from the time they were very young and who worked alongside them in the service whenever possible. They helped their children to see the pioneer work for what it really is, an opportunity to serve Jehovah, their brothers and mankind.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHAT THE PIONEERS SAY</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>16</sup> There are over 15,000 regular pioneers in this country now. Some have been in the pioneer work many years, others, just a short time. Some are young and others are on in years. How do they feel about the pioneer work and what do others say about them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>17</sup> Concerning a pioneer who moved to serve where the need is greater in Kansas a traveling overseer says, “He is a fine young brother with lots of ability and uses this with Jehovah’s aid to help others in the congregation as well as in the field service. He gives a good witness and works well with the publishers. Has six studies now but this should improve in the future after working the territory more. He is a hard worker, unafraid, a good teacher, willing to go wherever he is sent. The assignment here gives him great joy-”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> The pioneer work lays a good foundation for Bethel service. Another young brother, writing as he transferred from the pioneer ranks to become a member of the Bethel family, says, “The last three years of my life as a regular pioneer have certainly been the richest and most meaningful up to now. They have provided vital experience and training in the most urgent work there is. They have drawn me very close to Jehovah and I have learned a great deal about people and have come to love them.” Many others now at Bethel also served as pioneers before coming here and they say that this training was likewise of great benefit to them in many ways. Their deep love for the field service and also their desire to help people, remain with them, and so the experience is of value as they work on weekends and evenings with the congregation to which they are assigned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>19</sup> Pioneer work is not just for the young. One can start later in life and serve with effectiveness and joy. One sister from North Carolina says, “I just want to share my joy and happiness with you. When my pink card for April was sent in, it meant forty years of pioneer service—almost half of my life, since I am now eighty-three. It has been such a joy and privilege to serve Jehovah, teaching and making disciples. Now, when I see on the platform an elder giving talks, who was just a baby when I studied with his parents, my heart overflows with praise and thanksgiving to the Most High God for using me to make known His Word and Name to others.” When one can look back over a number of years of faithful service it provides a sense of true satisfaction. Such a person is glad he did not squander precious time but, rather, used it wisely.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> One pioneer, in full-time service since 1907, says, “At present I feel my service isn’t much, but it is a great joy to serve my Creator. I am thankful I had a share in putting out the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font8"> It reminded me of the first service I had the privilege of doing in 1906 when we put out </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible Students Monthly</span><span class="font8"> from door to door. And I am very happy as one of my students went out for the first time in the service recently and has continued since. It pays to be patient with studies as long as there is good interest.” Concerning her the circuit overseer says, “I believe she was more of an encouragement to me than I was to her. She more than adds to the pioneer spirit.” Here is an example of how faithfulness and zeal can be maintained over a period of many years and still be burning brightly at the age of ninety-three.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>21</sup> Another elderly pioneer says, “I am very crippled with arthritis all over my body and am not able to walk. But thanks to Jehovah I can still talk, write, phone and send out magazines. In this I am having wonderful results. I am eighty years old, in the truth forty-two years, a pioneer thirty-eight years. I have enjoyed every moment, every hour of my dedicated life. Thanks to Jehovah for his Word, his organization and all the faithful brothers and sisters. My life is happy and complete.” There is no desire here to retire from the pioneer work, but, rather, there is the urge to continue serving Jehovah and helping others to get on the road to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>FORMER PIONEERS</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> In the past there have been pioneers who, because of diminishing strength or personal circumstances, found it impossible to devote 100 hours each month to the work and thus transferred to the congregation publisher ranks. One brother writes, “My work schedule permitted me only four days for field service, of which I allotted one to my family, thus giving me only three days. I thus find it necessary to switch to publisher with the hopes of temporary pioneering every other month.” Another said, “I feel that I could do more good in the congregation by temporary pioneering a number of times each year and spending as much time as possible in personal visits and encouragement.” Another writes, “My wife and I are writing to inform you that we will be going off the pioneer list. Due to health and financial problems we feel that we cannot meet the required 1,200 hours for the service year. We certainly have enjoyed our time spent in the pioneer work and have had many good experiences to remember. Hopefully in six months one or both of us can renew our service to Jehovah as a pioneer.” Such former pioneers still have the desire to pioneer, and with the new reduced time requirements it is possible that some of them will be able to return to the ranks of the regular pioneers, but if not, they might be able to share in the auxiliary work often or continually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>23</sup> Is the pioneer work ‘easy’? Not necessarily. It requires wise use of time, diligent application and perseverance. Some pioneers have said that the first six months or so require a number of adjustments including getting up earlier in the morning, a better schedule, more walking. But the longer they were in the pioneer service the more satisfying it became. As they allowed time to adjust to the pioneer schedule and work they found that ‘the joy of Jehovah was their stronghold.’ (Neh. 8:10) The satisfaction of knowing that you are serving Jehovah, are responding to his leading, and that you are helping others on the way to life will truly make the pioneer work become a joyous way of life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> It is clear that Jehovah still has work for us to do in the gathering of more of the “great crowd.” Those whose circumstances will allow them to share in this work as pioneers will have the privilege of reaping many additional blessings. So speak with someone who has made a success of pioneer service. Find out how you might be able to succeed too. After prayerfully considering your circumstances, can you have a greater share in the gathering of additional members of the “great crowd”?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Serve Jehovah in Youth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tion. Full participation in the Theocratic School and assisting others in their lessons and talks will be of further great assistance in learning to read well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> A good schedule for active participation in the field service on a regular basis is something a young person should have. Not only will this contribute greatly toward the witness that must be given now, but it constitutes excellent training for being a fine field worker, able to converse with others easily and train new ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Will you be a pioneer when you finish high school? Will you apply for Bethel service? Do you hope eventually to be a ministerial servant, and in time, an elder? It would be good to begin now to learn how to shoulder responsibility. Being a good student of the Bible and sharing fully in all congregational activity open to you will be of great benefit. Associating with others in the congregation who have these same goals or who are presently serving in these capacities will also help you on your way.—Prov. 13:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Timothy had been taught the holy writings from infancy, and was probably in his late teens or early twenties when he was “well reported on by the brothers” to the apostle Paul. (Acts 16:1, 2; 2 Tim. 3:14, 15) Samuel, Israel’s last judge, began serving Jehovah in the temple under the direction of High Priest Eli possibly at the age of three and thereafter served long and faithfully. Josiah was only eight years old when he became king of Judah and, despite the influence of his idolatrous father, he turned to true worship when sixteen years of age and took the initiative to restore true worship in the land. The Israelite girl, who told the wife of Naaman, the Syrian general afflicted with leprosy, about the prophet Elisha, must have been very young as she is described as “a little girl.” (2 Ki. 5:2-4) Here are examples of young people who decided early in life that they would serve Jehovah and did so in an exemplary way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> There are many things that can fill the minds of young people today. But serving Jehovah, the Universal Sovereign, surpasses all other pursuits in which you could become engaged. Whether you serve him as a regular pioneer, auxiliary pioneer, or congregation publisher, do so with your whole soul, looking forward to increased blessings and responsibilities in the future.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Good Use</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> How thankful we are that Jehovah regularly provides “food at the proper time” so we can understand his Word! This spiritual food is highly valued by all of us. When a new publication is released at an assembly we quickly get a copy, leaf through it eagerly, then read it at the first opportunity. Likewise with the magazines we get four times a month. As we regularly study the Bible and these publications we get to know Jehovah better, find out how prophecy is being fulfilled and learn to live better lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In field service, too, our literature is invaluable. We cannot remember everything we read, nor is there time to discuss it all at the doors, so the truth is available to others in printed form. It can be read at the householder’s convenience and many, in this way, have learned the troth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> However, we need to be balanced in our use of the literature in the field. Placing literature is not an end in itself. Paul says: “We are not peddlers of the word of God as many men are, but as out of sincerity, yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ, we are speaking.” (2 Cor. 2:17) We are not literature salesmen and we do not want to give others that impression. We are God’s representatives and want to discuss Bible truths with people whenever possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Is it necessary that we try to make the literature offer at every door? No, not if the person is opposed, not interested, or if other circumstances indicate that it would not be appropriate. Especially is this so in territory that is worked often.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> When should literature be given away? If the one we are talking to appears to be interested and gives evidence of sincerity in saying he cannot afford to contribute for the literature, then, likely we would leave something for him to read, but, if it is obvious that the individual is not interested and the claim of having no money is a reflection of this lack of interest, then undoubtedly it would not be advisable to give the literature away. Each publisher would have to decide conscientiously what to do under the circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Good judgment must be used relative to leaving literature at the door when no one is at home, especially when the territory is worked often. If you feel that a magazine should be left, then by </span><span class="font13">of Our Literature</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8">all means it should be pushed out of sight under the door so it will not act as a signal to thieves that no one is at home. We can always leave a handbill and these can much more easily be slipped under the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> It is reported that in some congregations large numbers of magazines accumulate, get quite old and are never used. We want to avoid wasting literature. We should have the goal of ordering enough magazines but not more than we need. Each publisher should order what he believes is reasonable for his use and then if he places them quickly he can always use other literature. The elders can be alert to the needs of the publishers and adjust the order in harmony with what is realistic. If many magazines of a certain issue are not placed because of an assembly or bad weather, then all can be encouraged to put forth a special effort to use them the next week or so and thus get them into the hands of those who might read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah’s organization has certainly supplied us generously with literature to keep us spiritually strong and to aid us in the spreading of the good news. We can be confident that this fine provision will continue. Let us then make good use of our literature in magnifying His name.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Distributing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Neats </span><span class="font9">No. 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From November 5 to 14 we will have the privilege of distributing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 23 entitled “Why So Much Suffering—If God Cares?” So that we will be sure to give this message the best possible distribution in our territories, it would be good to begin organizing now. The elders and ministerial servants in charge of the various departments involved can start getting things in order so that territory and supplies can be handed out to publishers well in advance. Special meetings for field service can be arranged beforehand and the publishers informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be sure to make this ten-day period one of increased activity. With the elders taking oversight to see that the work is well organized and with all publishers setting aside extra time to share in this special effort, Jehovah’s blessing will surely be evident and the work will be accomplished smoothly and on time by our 7,324 congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">At Each Appropriate Opportunity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Are you prepared to talk about the truth as you go about your daily tasks? Jesus and his apostles were. Whether it was when they had especially set aside time for public witnessing or when simply making a stop at a well or marketplace, they were prepared to talk. (John 4:7-26; Acts 17:17) We likewise should have a keen desire to share the good news and be prepared to do so at times other than those regularly set aside for witnessing. We may be in the middle of something not directly related to the preaching work, but when an opportunity presents itself we should take advantage of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Many opportunities for informal witnessing present themselves. A sister may be busy with housework when a salesman calls. She might ask “Does anyone ask you if you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” This could lead to her giving a witness. At work or school there may be opportunities during lunch breaks to explain why we do not participate in some things others do. There may be opportunities to explain our view of holidays, honesty and respect for authority. Our good conduct may cause others to raise questions along this line.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Using public transportation provides many occasions to share the truth. Some publishers always carry copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font8">or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> or some other literature to read. Then noting that some around them have nothing to read, they do the kind thing and offer them something to read to help them to pass the time. This too calls for planning in advance as to how to turn such an occasion into an opportunity to forward the Kingdom interests.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Confinement in a hospital or visits there present excellent opportunities for informal witnessing. Many prepare in advance, taking along a variety of literature and jotting down scriptures such as those having to do with Jehovah’s view of blood. They are ready then to talk with doctors, nurses and others as opportunities open up. You may have to spend several days in a room with others who are convalescing. Talk with them about your hope. Many have learned the truth in this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> One sister, who spent quite a lot of time in hospitals as a patient recently, had a number of fine experiences witnessing to the hospital staff. She asked one nurse if it had required much discipline to learn her profession. The sister commented that she also had exercised considerable discipline to become a teacher of the Bible. The nurse had some questions on prayer, and so arrangements were made to talk with her again later that day during her time off. A discussion followed during which she showed considerable interest and took the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Many of us are in the truth today because our interest was first kindled through some casual contact with God’s people. We should leave no avenue untried in an effort to preach God’s Word before the end of this system. Why not think more about the opportunities you have for informal witnessing? Give thought in advance as to how you will take advantage of them. Be prepared so that you will be able to present the good news at every appropriate opportunity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">© To what extent can ministerial servants who are not especially good speakers be used on the service meeting program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some ministerial servants who are not especially good speakers nevertheless are encouraging and helpful to others, loyally and regularly support all congregational arrangements, are zealous in the field service and thus have the respect and the love of the congregation. It would be for the elders to decide to what extent they might be used on the service meeting. An elder or a more capable ministerial servant could be assigned as chairman of the part and others can be used to share in the assignment according to their ability. Thus the congregation benefits by hearing from such brothers occasionally on the service meeting, and these brothers are encouraged by being appropriately used on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some brothers who are not yet appointed as ministerial servants but who have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">good speaking ability,</span><span class="font7"> show a good spirit, and have the respect of the congregation. Can they be used on the service meeting? Again, it is up to the elders to decide. Such ones might be fitted into an assignment under the chairmanship of an elder. Arranging to have these brothers thus assigned could add interest and variety to the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We will still want to keep in mind, however, the high standard that the Bible sets for those who teach and the need to use only qualified speakers as chairmen. (Please see Question Box of January and February 1975 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span><span class="font7"> The arrangement for younger and newer brothers to receive training and experience in speaking is not through the service meeting, but through the Theocratic School, commenting at meetings and field service. It is the elders who have the primary responsibility to teach on the service meeting. We hope the observations made above will provide a balanced view without detracting from the high standard of instruction we should receive at our service meetings.</span></p>

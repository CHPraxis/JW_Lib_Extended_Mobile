<p><span class="font1">Vol. 19, No. 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">FOR UNITED STATES</span><span class="font1"> OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ADea/t ^Kingdom ^PuMiste:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the beginning of April there was a series of five meetings held in different sections of the United States with the circuit and district overseers. The Society was interested in their observations on a number of things in connection with our worship and, field service and a very valuable and interesting interchange of encouragement resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We thought you w’ould be quite interested in one of the main points that was brought out rather consistently at all of these meetings. This had to do with the need on the part of all of our brothers to get better acquainted with the Bible in connection with personal study and Christian meetings and to learn how to use it to greater advantage in resolving problems as well as in preaching the good news in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Likely you have noticed too that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> has encouraged the use of the Bible wherever possible in our public worship. Not only does this stamp us as Christ’s disciples, but reading directly from it gives power and authority to our words. To get better acquainted with God’s Word, many of our brothers are increasing their reading of it on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Over the years we have featured the distribution of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> twice each year in the field service. Isn’t it fitting that we should do so, making the Word of God available to the people in our territory since we truly are a Bible-based congregation? Interestingly, from 1942 down to 1976, 34,330,375 copies of the Scriptures, the w’hole or in part, have been produced here in Brooklyn. Most of these have been copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We certainly are delighted to be serving with you brothers, producing Bibles and Bible literature, and we count it a privilege to be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Use The Bible —Its Message Is Powerful</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and ... is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) These words indeed tell us of the power of God’s word or message found in the Bible, which all of us have for use in our field service to help people to get free from false religion and enable them to learn the way of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The “word of God” has exerted great power in our lives in that we have been delivered from the bonds of darkness in Babylon the Great and have been equipped to use the Bible to enable others to do likewise. By using it well in our field service activity we may find many others whose hearts can be motivated to look into its message so as to treasure its lifesaving influence in their lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How appropriate that we use the Word of God in our field service, both in our conversations at the door and in offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> to the people along with the bound book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Truth Is </span><span class="font3">Beneficial Each ©ay</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In a great many congregations our sisters are making an excellent contribution to the advancement of the Kingdom work. They work hard with their families, are zealous in field service and often put up with many problems and frustrations in order to walk in their integrity, day by day. Of course, soon now a New Order will resolve these problems. But even now our sisters, and all of us, are benefited greatly by having the truth. Have you reflected lately on how the truth can benefit you each day?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW THE TRUTH BENEFITS THE MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We realize that if you have an unbelieving husband, perhaps even opposed or unbelieving children, there can be many problems in your home. But the blessing of knowing the truth and applying its principles is that we can learn to cope with our situations better. We can learn to live with problems, rather than let them get us down. For example, many of our sisters with opposed husbands have a calm spirit and lead a quiet, well-ordered life. How? The truth has helped them to look at </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good!</span><span class="font11"> This will be the offer for June on a contribution of $1.25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IT’S EASY TO PRESENT THE OFFER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> To offer the Bible to people during the month we suggest a simple, straightforward approach, reading from the Bible itself. For example, you might have your Bible ready to open to Psalm 119: 105 as you approach the door, and you might begin with the words of this scripture after an appropriate local introduction. By using this scripture you direct attention to the Bible that you have in your hand, which is like a lamp and a light. If the opportunity presents itself, read verse 130 also. Comment on the fact that it is God’s purpose for mankind to enjoy an earth filled with righteousness and with upright people, and offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font11">and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font11"> book, explaining that they are for those who wish to understand more of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">.their situation in a balanced way. These sisters have learned not to expect too much too soon from their husbands and families, and their calm, quiet spirit has been an influence for good on their husbands and other members of their family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One sister thought recently that she could not endure any more mental and verbal abuse from her opposed husband. On her own she decided to separate from him, but before doing this she went to Jehovah in prayer and read carefully 1 Corinthians 7: 10-16 and 1 Peter 3:1-6. She reviewed her situation with two of the local elders and obtained mature advice and help. Thereafter she decided to talk to her husband and tell him what she had thought about doing but reconsidered in the light of the Scriptures. She spoke to him kindly and respectfully, but frankly, and her opposed husband reacted favorably. He had not seen his actions objectively, but assured his wife that things would be better. The truth benefited this sister greatly because she took a wholesome, Scriptural </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' VOOiR SERVICE MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">14 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 20. Introductory comments. Lively consideration of article “Use the Bible—Its Message Is Powerful,” with discussion of points and appropriate questions and answers. Include demonstration of the offer, perhaps with father teaching child to use the Bible in field, if desired. Slant from viewpoint of fathers taking family lead in public worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Highlight the Bible in Your Conversation. Deal with the ways in which family heads and others can use the Bible in their preaching and teaching work. Discuss with audience how to talk with: (1) A person who show's interest in integrity in government. Show how this has been a problem of long standing with mankind; and show what is the solution. What scriptures could you use? (Mic. 3:9; Hab. 1:4; Isa. 11:5) (2) A person concerned with social injustice and the poor. What scriptures would be appropriate? (Prov. 12:7, 28; Mic. 4:3, 4 or Ps. 72:13, 14) These and many other scriptures you might have listed in the front of your Bible that you use in the field in order to quickly turn to the Word of God when assisting people. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure” </span><span class="font9">has a wealth of information to help all of us in using the Bible in the field service to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font9">“How Well Do You Know Your Family?” Interview parents w'hose mates are not in the truth with regard to: (1) How and when family study is conducted. (2) What arrangements are made for training in field service. (3) How respect is cultivated for unbelieving parent. Then have a panel of three or four who have good backgrounds in Christian living to discuss how a family can be brought closer together by (1) eating meals together, (2) praying together as a family, (3) participating in field service together, (4) sitting together at meetings, (5) w’orking on projects together, such as cleaning the Kingdom Hall, etc., (6) training of boys and girls in day-to-day living. Chairman should make sure points are upbuilding and realistic, emphasizing benefits that result when father takes the lead in worship. Encourage brothers to take notes as to what they find practical so as to knit their families more closely together in the worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">16 </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font9">Concluding remarks. Include brief comments on Branch Letter; also cover material in “Questions from Readers” in the June 1, 1976, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> Song 81.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 70. Introduction. Explain that the meeting has been arranged to discuss problems our sisters have and possible solutions. Many have opposed or indifferent husbands, difficult situations at home, etc. Want to exchange some practical suggestions. There will be opportunity during various parts of the program to express oneself, share experiences and observations, which should be beneficial to all in attendance, especially our sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">“The Truth Is Beneficial Each Day.” Question-and-answer coverage. Allow time for local experiences primarily along the lines of those mentioned in the article. One handling the part should prepare participants ahead of time so will be most beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">The Woman’s Role in Strengthening the Family. Mothers usually spend more time with children in early formative years than fathers. They can be a marvelous influence for good and can have considerable impact on the habits and attitudes developed in early years. Ask audience such questions as: What should mothers discuss with their children from infancy so young minds can be molded along spiritual lines? How can mothers train children in harmony with Deuteronomy 6:6-9? How and when can mothers arrange to participate with their children in field service? How can some temporary pioneer, strengthening the family further along spiritual lines? Let the sisters and others comment on these questions, offering their observations, sharing ideas with one another. We can all learn from this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Concluding remarks. Accounts report. Short talk on “Question Box” emphasizing main points. Then ask those in attendance what they learned from meeting. Encourage sisters to state what they have learned in a practical way. Song 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths, Remember Your Creator. —Eccl. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 73. Introduction. Encourage parents and children to make this meeting their own. There will be time, especially in concluding comments, for expressions on things of a practical nature learned. Make some notes. Pay close attention to what is said and see what you can learn about cultivating a warmer, closer relationship with Jehovah and your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: A </span><span class="font9">Child That Is a Praise to His Grand Creator. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{Aid</span><span class="font9"> book, pp. 311-313) Consideration by audience participation of following points: (1) What does Psalm 127:3-5 show as to how one’s children should be viewed? (2) What responsibilities do fathers and mothers have in training their children? (Prov. 1:8; 22:6; Eph. 6:4) (3) What attitude did young Jesus show toward the worship and service of his heavenly Father? (Luke 2:41-49) (4) How does Psalm 148:12, 13 show that boys and girls are to be worshipers of Jehovah God? (5) What attitude toward their parents should children have? (Lev. 19:3; Deut. 5:16; 27:16) (6) How should young children treat older persons? (Lev. 19:32) (7) What attitude should children have toward congregation meetings? (Deut. 31:12, 13) (8) Why should children also be taught respect toward those in the congregation who are looking after the spiritual interests of the brothers? (1 Pet. 5:5; 2 Ki. 2:23, 24) (9) What warning did Jesus give about children turning against their believing parents in our day? (Mark 13:12) (10) How should all children who would have Jehovah’s favor conduct themselves in this urgent time?—Eccl. 11:9; 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Presenting the Good News— Together with Your Children. Question-and-answer coverage along with realistic demonstration of points in paragraph two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font9">Concluding remarks. Consider theme of meeting: Youths, Remember Your Creator. (Eccl. 12:1) Young people appreciate parents who spend time with them. Do you know what is in the hearts of your children? In addition to taking them with you in the field service, how can you determine this? Good to take advantage of every opportunity to inculcate knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s Word in their hearts. (Deut. 6:4-9) For example, what do your children know about the soul, paradise earth and resurrection? Make sure they understand fundamental Bible doctrines and can explain them. Good to train them to memorize at least one scripture supporting each doctrine. Also, would be beneficial to learn the nine fruits of the spirit and have a scripture to back up or support each one. Many things we can do to train our children so that in later years they will have a fund of knowledge to draw from when problems arise or issues come up. Could have parents demonstrate what one or two cnildren in the congregation have accomplished along these lines. Fit the experiences to local circumstances and situations. Allow time for comments on what young people, especially, and their parents have learned from this meeting and what they resolve to do to improve their relationship with Jehovah and their parents. Song 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 69. Introduction. “Keep the Poor in Mind.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> April 1, 1976, pp. 200-202) Discuss with audience, showing the part those in the congregation play in giving attention to the poor. Emphasize and read appropriate scriptures. Not only elders and ministerial servants, but each one in the Christian congregation, is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Proper Respect for Congregation Meetings. Discussion. Stress the role of elders and ministerial servants in taking the lead in showing proper respect for meetings; being at the Kingdom Hall early, being seated during meetings and not carrying on other business, unless of an urgent nature that cannot be done at other appropriate time; keeping meetings on time; parents encouraged to sit with children during meetings, children should be taught by parents to be attentive, should not be allowed to unduly disrupt meetings. Whispering excessively should be avoided as well as other distractions. Highlight thought that Kingdom Hall is a house for Jehovah’s worship, and we should appreciate keeping it clean and in good repair. This part should be given in a balanced way, reasoning with the audience so that respect is built up for this feature of our Christian worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: How Are We Doing in Spreading the Good News? A lively experience session, with audience participation regarding the work accomplished recently, including offering the Bible and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font9"> book, as well as magazines and other literature. This can be in all fields of service, house to house, return visits, Bible studies, informal witnessing. Perhaps beforehand one or two can be asked to be prepared so as to get discussion started. Would be good to inquire as to how families did in sharing together in service during June. Outline current field service arrangements for the week, including holiday activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Concluding comments. Include appropriate items from “Announcements” and “Theocratic News.” Song 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Branch Letter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">working with you in connection with your field service needs. May Jehovah continue to go with all of us. Please accept an expression of our warm Christian love at this time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW THE FIELD SERVICE HELPS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Often just getting out of the house and telling the good news to others has a healthful effect on our outlook. One sister says that one way she has been able to keep her joy throughout the years is to be active in the service and in helping others. (Acts 20:35) This sister finds the Kingdom Hall a peaceful place, and the joy she gets from attending meetings and being with her spiritual brothers and sisters keeps her built up for the rest of the week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> But what if you have young children and want to get into the field service? One couple we know have taken their youngster along in the field service from infancy. While one conversed at the door, the other stayed by the baby carriage on the sidewalk when the child was very young. Householders were impressed. A former missionary sister tells us that, even though having a child, she continued to have fine success at the doors, for the people were fascinated by seeing her go from house to house w’ith the baby carried on her back, and this opened many doors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Still other sisters have expressed themselves as having a most satisfied feeling by working with the pioneers on occasion, trying to accompany them for a full day wherever possible. They are built up by having valuable association with the pioneers, and there</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font9"> Literature offer for June: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> (bil2) and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good,</span><span class="font9"> for 81.25. For July: In isolated territory the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">subscription or a pocket-size publication not offered yet in that particular territory. In regular territory: A pocket-size publication on a contribution of 25c or four for §1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> (bil2) is available in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> is available in Finnish, Danish and Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O Elders should arrange for a review of district assembly material on the service meeting. It would be good to schedule it soon after most of the congregation attends an assembly. Make appropriate adjustments in coverage of material in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font9"> for that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">•O The congregation accounts should be audited on June 1, or as soon thereafter as possible by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him. </span><span class="font11">is a rich interchange of encouragement, benefiting the pioneers also. —Rom. 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN YOUR FAMILY BEST BE HELPED?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Where husbands and wives both work at secular jobs, they do well to think about the effect this has on them and their families. Is it necessary that the wife work also? Could you possibly adjust your standard of living so she is able to have more time for the children, her husband, personal study and the field service? Is it possible that more time with the children, training them in the truth at all times, is needed by your family even more than the money you earn? (Deut. 6:4-9; Eph. 6:1-4) Is it possible that a re-evaluating of priorities, especially your time, might be quite beneficial in your family? Each family has to decide what is best according to its circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The truth obviously benefits us in so many ways each day. By our really applying Bible principles each day and not putting things off until a future time, the truth can be a powerful force for good in our lives, day by day. Think of the blessings we can gain: the security of really knowing Jehovah (Prov. 18:10), an increased faith so that we will not drift away from our relationship with Jehovah (Heb. 2:1), a more joyful, happy outlook (Prov. 17:22a). These and many other blessings can be ours if we make the truth our own and gain its benefits each day.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">O The following new publications are available in English braille, grade two: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A Secure Future—How You Can Find It; There Is Much More to Life!; Is There a God Who Cares?</span><span class="font9"> These may be obtained on a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">free-loan basis</span><span class="font9"> by submitting a written request to the Society, Attention: Braille Desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font9">The Government has announced that the Selective Service arrangement ceased to function as of January 23, so none now reaching 18 years of age will have to register. Brothers of draft age who are in the pioneer service, or elders or ministerial servants, should not request of the Society certificates to use verifying their ordination, since the draft arrangement no longer functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a reminder, all regular and special pioneers should bring their United States convention pioneer identification card with them to the assembly. This will be used in connection with meals and for literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How encouraging it is to note the continuing fine field service efforts we shared in during March! In view of the fact that 7,148,062 hours were devoted in public worship, undoubtedly a powerful witness to the truth was given. As we continue to work together in the field as families, with fathers taking the lead, surely Jehovah will continue to bless and reward us greatly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">ing families I would like to share with you some thoughts from God, who created the first family. Here in Colossians 3:18-21, God speaks about families and what each one can do to bring happiness in the family circle. Note what verse 20 says about young children. [Then read verse 20.] The Bible is filled with instructions for families, and so that each family might have an up-to-date translation of the Bible, we are offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> along with this companion pubheation for $1.25.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Or, if you prefer, you could simply say: “As a young person looking forward to the future, I’d love to see the end of pain and death. Wouldn’t you? Did you know that the Bible says that time is coming shortly?” Read Revelation 21:4. Then make the offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Training our children as Christians in every possible way and at every opportunity is not only a God-given responsibility, but a happy way of life for Christian families. (Deut. 6:4-9; 1 Tim. 5:8) If you would like to get to know your children better, what they are really thinking about, how they feel about matters, ascertaining how much they really love Jehovah, arrange time to take them with you in the field service. Truly, it will be a rewarding experience.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TRUTH SETS US FREE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Never underestimate the power of God’s Word. Use the Bible itself in your public worship from house to house, on return visits and in your Bible study work. A pioneer sister from Nebraska who began publishing in 1968 said that she had not made great effort before to use the Bible in the house-to-house work. Now the work has taken on a completely new dimension for her, so that she is enjoying her field service more and getting more people to listen. Your use of God’s Word among the people has more than one purpose. Not only do they get a witness but they are helped to see that the message comes from God’s own Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Our Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated the effectiveness and power of the Word of God to help people. He knows that it is the truth, that is what he preached and he set the example for us to follow</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">Together with Your Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do you know that one of the best ways to ascertain the spiritual growth of your children is by taking them with you in the field service? There is opportunity to converse as you walk between houses. As you listen to how they talk to householders and the answers they give to questions raised, you can learn much about how well they understand the truth and how deeply they appreciate it. At first small children might just offer the handbills or tracts, but as you train them progressively they can learn to offer the magazines, give a short Scriptural presentation, and possibly make the regular offer, eventually being able to conduct a Bible study. Surely such training and a response to it by children are a delight to observe. Really it is a demonstration of their faith growing stronger and stronger. What could be more satisfying to a parent? Suppose you have children who could be trained to give a Bible presentation. What might they say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> After introducing himself, and stating that he is assisting his parents in sharing Bible knowledge with his neighbors, a young person could say: “There seem to be many problems in families today, but as a young person interested in help-Use iho Bible &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the light of truth contained in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Those who are fathers and mothers, are you training your children to use the Bible itself in the field? Perhaps your son or daughter could use this Bible presentation as you share together in the house-to-house work or, if you prefer, you could help your children to learn the presentation featured in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>e</sup> You might also find it helpful, especially for those who are in a hurry, quickly to point out a highlight of the book we are offering during the month of June, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font11"> book. The opening paragraph sets the tone for encouraging people to obtain and read this Bible publication. It says: “Life on earth is taking on new interest for increasing num-' bers of people as our twentieth century nears its end.” After reading that short sentence you could point out that this Bible study aid along with the Bible itself is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Australia reports that the brothers in the city of Adelaide have built a beautiful assembly hall holding 1,600 persons. It is a credit to Jehovah's worship and his people. The dedication was attended by 5,200 over two days. This is the second of such halls in Australia and two more are planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Foreign-language circuit assemblies have already been held for the brothers speaking Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and Greek here in the New York city area. The brothers are thrilled to be having their own assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Japan continues its theocratic progress with another new peak—36,195 publishers. During February and March, 112 special pioneers were assigned to open up 46 completely new territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">♦ The Dominican Republic had its third consecutive peak, with 6,540 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font9">What should he our view of presentations suggested in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font9"> designed for the house-to-house activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are suggestions. We all appreciate the wisdom of being prepared to have something definite to say about the good news when we engage in field service. Presentations are provided often in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font9"> and give us a variety of things we might say. (1 Cor. 9:22) These are especially helpful if we are working our territory quite often. Nonetheless, we appreciate that there are many different situations and objections that come up in various sections of the country and we need to be flexible. It is good to tailor our presentations to arouse the interest of the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a presentation suggested in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font9"> can be adapted to local usage, you may want to make use of it. But if you have developed something that is more practical for your territory and you are able to express the thoughts more readily, you are free to use your own presentation. The main thing to keep in mind is that we are preaching the good news of the Kingdom. If we make the message clear and uncomplicated, using our Bibles to good advantage, surely we will have many blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">in his footsteps. His words at John 8:31, 32 show this: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” We know the truth. We are free of false religion’s grip. Our responsibility and privilege now is to help others to gain that truth and freedom. During the month of June may we prove to be highly successful in distributing the Word of God, making return visits and starting home Bible studies as we use the Bible, for its message is indeed powerful.</span></p>

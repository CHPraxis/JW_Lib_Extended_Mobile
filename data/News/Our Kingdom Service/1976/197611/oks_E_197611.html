<p><span class="font14">Here at Brooklyn we enjoy having a part in providing publications for your use and to be used in the field. Recently we have had the privilege of producing four million copies of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book, and we are glad it is now available in English, Spanish and German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It has been exciting to hear so many expressions of appreciation for the book from youths themselves. In Germany a fifteen-year-old student commented: “This book is a virtual mine of information. These comments will interest many of my schoolmates, who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses.” From Canada we heard these comments from a teen-ager: “It really got to me, realizing all the situations you can get into. We should know what the problems are before we start, or it can be too late. Everyone else seems to want to force you into doing wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A Canadian father of five children said: “This publication will be a real safeguard for our young people in view of the problems in school and in the world. It will promote understanding of the world into which they are emerging and promote family unity. I feel this will be a good book for our field service and I feel our teen-agers can use it also in the service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These are but a few of the many expressions and they really make us happy to produce more of these </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> books so they can be gotten into the hands of the teen-agers, where they will do so much good. We know the youth need salvation, and many of them will find just what they are looking for in the pages of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We hope all of you will have a wonderful time distributing the book and helping both parents and teen-agers to find happiness in living. May Jehovah’s blessing go with your efforts to use the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font14">book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We Have What We Need!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">today’s teen-agers are growing up in an unsettled, topsy-turvy world. Many teen-agers are searching for answers to what life is really all about. Living conditions are far different from those of twenty or more years ago when their parents were growing up. Problems of youth today are also different. So in recent years a need has developed for a publication that would be of interest and help to the teen-age group. And now we have what we need—the new book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth —Getting the Best out of It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> This new book should be an excellent help to young people. But they need to get it in their hands and read it to benefit from it. It is our privilege to put it there. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book tells them, on page 5: “Youth is a time of challenge. . . . The road of life today has plenty of rough spots. It takes courage to face them. But if you learn early how to overcome the rough spots, then the rest of the road becomes far smoother for you.” This book directs young folks to God’s Word and shows how problems of life can be handled in the right way, making life more satisfying, as well as enabling persons to be pleasing to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus was upon the earth, he was interested in people and he felt tender affection for them. He cared about what was happening to them. That is why he toured the cities and villages and preached the good news of the Kingdom among them. He saw that they were knocked about like sheep without a shepherd. Not only did he help the people personally, but he arranged to send out more workers into the harvest, namely, his twelve disciples, as mentioned in Matthew chapters nine and ten.—See Matthew 9:35-38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Being interested in people and showing that they care for them are Christian characteristics demonstrated by the footstep followers of Jesus Christ. While false religion’s leaders may not care for the people and do not take care of their spiritual needs, God is not to blame for that, and we do not want to see anyone accuse God of being responsible for the suffering that has come upon the human family. Therefore, the distribution of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font14"> No. 23 in November (from 5 to 14) presents us with a wonderful opportunity. This tract has a message that brings honor to Jehovah. People need to know why</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Today there are many young people in Jehovah’s organization, and many thousands are coming in. In fact, quite a few teen-agers accept the truth despite parental opposition. They recognize the ring of truth when they hear the good news preached to them. They accept it and show their desire to serve Jehovah by entering into a dedicated relationship with Him, doing so while still youthful. (Eccl. 12:1) The new </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book will certainly help these young publishers to get Jehovah’s mind on matters and to make their minds over to Jehovah’s way of thinking. —Rom. 12:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WH® ALSO NEED m</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Who besides the young publishers need the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book? Certainly parents and grandparents will find it very helpful in their families. They should encourage their children and grandchildren to read it personally. They can also read the book along with them so the entire family will benefit together. We believe that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book will help many parents to become more familiar with the problems facing children and teen-agers today and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">there is so much suffering on the earth and who is responsible for it, and the majority should be very much interested in the question, “Why So Much Suffering—If God Cares?”, which is the title of the new tract. There is every reason for us to be enthusiastic in presenting this message.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The last time we distributed a tract here in the United States, about 10,500 requests for free booklets were received at the office in Brooklyn. So .a great amount of good was accomplished. This time there will be another offer of a free booklet and we hope the response will be even better. Perhaps you can cover territory that was not covered with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font14"> No. 22. But, whatever territory you work, start out in the work early in the campaign. In the cities many publishers may be able to distribute their tracts during the first three days of the campaign. If that be the case, then the regular offer can be used in the field for the remaining period.</span></p></li>

Discuss need for Christian parents to appreciate responsibility to train children. Worldly parents often sidestep such responsibility by shifting it to teachers, school counselors, older relatives, etc. Not so with Christian parents. Children an inheritance from Jehovah. (Ps. 127:3-5) How do you handle an inheritance from the Sovereign of the universe? Sincere Christians would handle such wisely, with extreme care. So children should be handled in this way. Parents themselves have responsibility to train children. (Deut. 6:6, 7) How?</span></p>

Deliverance is near. (Luke 21:25-28) In the meantime we have work to do—preaching of Kingdom in all the earth and making disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Work still continues and has success.

<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) See there is need for all to share in preaching and teaching work if sheeplike people are to hear &quot;voice” of Fine Shepherd. Young people need to hear, too, and our young publishers are in an excellent position to help them. How? By good communication. Young people usually know which youths are Jehovah’s Witnesses because the Witnesses communicate. New </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font12">book provides excellent material to use in talking to other young people. Could you read a chapter and then discuss it with others, explaining some of the main points and/or Scripture texts, without using the book? This is a fine thing to do. Note this young publisher:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) Young publisher at school approached by new student at school. New student offers some marijuana or pills. Young publisher politely turns down offer. New student very surprised, as nearly everyone uses drugs of some form. Third student listening to conversation inquires about young publisher’s view on drugs.

<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) Chairman briefly interviews two young publishers in demonstrations: Could ask these or similar questions: Do you find the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book is easy to understand? What helps you to remember the points well? Do you find the book helpful in talking to other young people? Do you find that other youths are interested in getting a copy of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book for themselves ? Conclude by showing that young publishers have a great advantage in speaking to other young people. Encourage them to use this advantage well as they talk about fine things they read 'in new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Hearing the Voice of God and the Voice of Jesus. (Audience discussion using the Bible) In times past Jehovah’s voice has been audibly heard by humans. (Three occasions: [1] Jesus’ baptism. [Mark 1:11] [2] Jesus’ transfiguration. [Mark 9:7] [3] 33 C.E. shortly before Jesus’ last Passover. [John 12:28, 29]) People today can also hear God’s voice. How? Does not require Jehovah to speak in a literal, audible voice. People can hear God’s voice by recognizing and paying attention with obedience to what God has caused to be written in His Word. “Voice” used as applying to “every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) Similar with voice of Jesus. Called himself the “fine shepherd” whose sheep “listen to his voice, . . . and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.” (John 10:2-5, 11) Christ’s “sheep” “know” his voice in that they recognize and acknowledge as true what Jesus said, as recorded in the Bible. They refuse to acknowledge the teaching of “strangers,” false shepherds. They obey his commands. How then will people today hear the voices, of God and his Chief Shepherd? By hearing God’s commands and principles as set forth in the Scriptures. Who will tell them? Not the clergy! No, but only Jehovah’s Witnesses carry on work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching Bible truth in all the earth. Though Jesus Christ is not now speaking in person, people can ‘hear his voice’ through visible representatives, even as overseer Paul made appeal as substituting for Christ. (2 Cor. 5:20) When Paul preached in Philippi people listened. (Acts 16:14) How urgent that we carry on this same work today if people are going to hear God’s “voice”! We cannot ourselves judge if people are “sheep” or “goats.” Individuals not predestined for either class. All must hear, and we must continue to preach. (Rom. 10:14) Are there still people in your territory willing to listen? Undoubtedly there are. Continue to preach the Word and let people hear the ‘voices’ of God and of Jesus. Then they can make a decision and in time show whether they are “sheep” who will gain life, or * goats” to be judged by Jesus as worthy of destruction. (Matt. 25:31-46) All of us, whether young or old, can rejoice to share in this unique vocal work.—Matt. 11:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Interview several young publishers who have had good success in placing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font12"> book, either at school •with youths or teachers, or in field, or by informal witnessing. Find out what they do and have them relate their experiences. Encourage all to use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font12">book and call back to see if home Bible studies can be started with young persons in territory.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During 1977 the School schedule should be conducted in all congregations as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> [w], </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> [g], </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font13"> [so], and the books </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font13"> [ad], </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Good News to Make You Happy</span><span class="font13"> [g/i], </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font13"> [sg] and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It</span><span class="font13"> [yy] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">INSTRUCTION TALK: No. 1: 15 minutes. This should, not be just a summary of the assigned material. It should be a well-developed talk on a chosen theme, assigned to an elder if possible, or, when necessary, to a qualified ministerial servant. The coverage should not be superficial but should provide a presentation that is truly informative and helpful to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ORAL REVIEW: 5 minutes. This will immediately follow the No. 1 talk, and will be conducted by the same brother who gave the talk. The review will be conducted, not the following week, but on the same night that the talk is given. The questions asked should help the audience to see clearly the main points covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 2: 6 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material. The reading assignments are short enough to permit the student to present explanatory information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at fitting intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, application of principles and expressions of appreciation for the wisdom reflected in the text may be included. The talk should be planned in a way that allows for all the assigned verses actually to be read. The allotted time should be fully utilized. The material may be presented as a talk to the congregation, or a boy may read it to his father or to another qualified older brother seated on the platform. The father or other older brother may then use questions to draw from the boy comments on the value of the material or he may offer suggestions with a view to helping him to improve his reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TALKS NOS. 3 AND 4: 6 minutes each. These talks are assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering one of these talks, the student may be either seated or standing. Although using mainly notes and the Bible, the students, when appropriate, may read excerpts or quotations from the assigned material. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, the congregation or elsewhere; at times the presentation may simply be informative conversation between family members or others. The sister giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant (s) do so. Not the setting, but the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SCHEDULE FOR 1977</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">TALK NO. 5: 6 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience, it should be a talk to the entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the speaker, when fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material especially lends itself to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points in mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip. When a setting is selected, endeavor to choose one that will show practical use of the material assigned, where that is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">COUNSEL: Specific counsel on each student talk will be given, following the program of progressive counsel outlined at the bottom of the Speech Counsel slip. Appreciative comments on important points covered by speakers, whether stated by the counselor or elicited from the audience by means of review questions, can help to keep the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. Be careful to use no more than two minutes for counseling each student talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TIMING: No talk should go overtime; neither should the counsel. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 will be stopped if necessary when the time is up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">ad, gh, sg</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">yy</span><span class="font13"> and complete the assignment of personal Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this thirty-minute review. The balance of the hour will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper and, in reading off the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, stressing the matter of accurate knowledge and letting the audience turn to the textbooks where the answers may be checked. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of fifty or more students should arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other elders, if possible. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it seems advisable, sisters may take any talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talks Nos. 3 and 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ABSENTEEISM: If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Study Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> At our weekly congregation book study we are currently using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation</span><span class="font14"> book. It appears that most of the congregations will be able to complete their study of this book by the end of November. Therefore, beginning with December the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font14"> book will be used for six months. After that it is planned that we will study the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit </span><span class="font14">book for the next six months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> So that there will be uniformity in the study of these books throughout the country, a schedule will appear each month in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font14"> beginning with December, listing the pages to be studied each week during that month. This will help to keep some from dragging out the lessons and others from hurrying through the material too fast. Also, this uniformity will be of aid when any brothers visit another congregation, as when on a vacation, for they will always know where the lesson is for any book study evening. This will also prove helpful to the presiding overseer as he may visit different book study groups as well as to the circuit overseer as he goes from one congregation to another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If for any reason, such as assembly time or severe weather problems, a study is not held, the section scheduled for that week can be combined with the material scheduled for the following week. In such instances not all paragraphs have to be read, so that the study is completed within the hour. </span><span class="font0">We Have What We Need! </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font14">it should assist these parents in communicating with their children. Thus they will be in a better position to aid their children and grandchildren spiritually and in other matters of living.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE CAN WE PLACE IT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Consider people whom you know and who could benefit from this new publication. You may have neighbors or relatives with teen-age children who would greatly appreciate it. Also, youth counselors, school authorities and even policemen may find it useful in their work. Young publishers or parents may wish to show this book to teachers and encourage them to read it. Some publishers may find it productive to do street witnessing near high schools, colleges or universities, offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book to young people they meet. You may know some older persons who</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Each congregation should give careful attention to the ordering of magazines. It is good to order what you need. Quantities can be adjusted as the needs increase or decrease. It is good not to run out of magazines. At the same time, it is not good to have magazines accumulate, thus wasting paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When offering current magazines, it is appropriate to ask for the contribution. Our experience has proved that publications are viewed as of greater value by the individuals who contribute for them.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>1977 School Schedule</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The Theocratic School Schedule for 1977 is being sent with this issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service. </span><span class="font14">This schedule should prove to be especially helpful to all those who enrolled in recent years. Note that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font14"> will furnish the Instruction Talk material throughout the year. Thus all will become more familiar with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook.</span><span class="font14"> The Theocratic School has two objectives: (1) To improve our ability to present Bible truth, and (2) to make us more familiar with God’s Word, its doctrines and principles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The student talks will feature </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines,</span><span class="font14"> the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font14"> book. By our going through these two books received at our district assemblies, all will personally profit thereby, as well as be helped in offering these books to others. Presiding overseers should check to see that the congregation has sufficient </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font14"> on hand, and if not, should order these at once.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Showing that We Care </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font14">ignore interest that is shown. It is suggested that we carry along a copy of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book. This can be offered to any who show unusual interest. Where circumstances permit, take time to talk to interested people, be friendly. Carry along equipment so you can make written note of special interest and make it a point to call back sometime during the month of November to see how the persons enjoyed the message. If we take time to talk to the interested people as we meet them, it can be very beneficial to them. We cannot be sure that we will meet the individual again, so it is good to give the witness while we have the opportunity. Leaving a Scriptural thought with someone will only result in good.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Those who are conducting home Bible studies with interested persons may wish to present a copy of the tract and explain that all over the world this message is being given out to as many people as possible. Ask each of these interested persons whether they would like to have a few copies, say five or ten, to give to some friends or acquaintances. When they see the message in the tract, those who study may be very enthusiastic about the opportunity to pass on such good information.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> We are confident that the campaign with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font14"> No. 23 will prove to be a great blessing, because all of us, as Christians, care for people. May Jehovah bless the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font14"> campaign.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the “Youth” Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> It is our wish to see the young people get the best out of their youth. The new book about youth will be a great help to young people, and we want to get it into their hands. Also, it will help parents and grandparents who have much to do with young people. You may already have in mind some points to use in presenting the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book and you are welcome to use them. We do not want always to leave the door as soon as somebody accepts a book. Keep in mind that our real desire is to start Bible discussions where circumstances so allow. Following are some suggestions that may be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> To open a presentation the question might be asked, “Did you realize that half of the world’s population now is under twenty years of age? All of us should be interested in the youth today. The Creator certainly is and he wants them to enjoy life. [Read the first part of Ecclesiastes 11:9.] But do we see all of the young people truly happy in these days? They face many pressures in life; there are many traps and pitfalls that take away happiness. Many of their problems can be avoided if they know what the Creator has to say. [See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book, page 144.] Knowledge is a protection. Knowledge of God’s Word is especially beneficial at this time. It can protect the youth from disappointment and calamity. [Read Ecclesiastes 11:10 and introduce the book.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If the person being spoken to is a youth, then instead of speaking about the youth or young people, you can say ‘you’ and you may wish to include the first part of Ecclesiastes 12:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In speaking either to youths or to adults the question might be asked, “What do you believe is the greatest problem facing young people today?” There may be a variety of responses, depending upon the personal experience of the one to whom you speak. If it is the danger of drugs, then we have Chapter 15. If someone feels that there is really no future for the youth today, there is Chapter 24. Really, whatever the response may be, we should have in mind an appropriate chapter in the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If an older person comes to the door, we may wish to inquire as to whether there are any teen-agers living in the home. If the response is in the affirmative, we may point out that many people do not realize that half of the world’s population today is under twenty years of age. Then go into the presentation of Ecclesiastes 11:9, as outlined above, and follow up by showing that we are all interested in youths and want to help them to get the best out of their lives. For that reason this book has been published. It has proved to be a great help to adults in counseling and dealing with youths, and because of its contents, many parents and grandparents are presenting a copy to each one of their children or grandchildren as an aid in making a success of his or her personal life. Reference can be made to the table of contents. It may be said that many parents have found it difficult to raise these subjects with youths, so the book has proved an invaluable aid. Chapters are arranged with subheadings, and groups of paragraphs under the subheading can be read and then discussed together with the young people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> No doubt publishers who are parents will be enthusiastic in recommending this new publication to other parents. Here is a suggestion they could use: “As a parent surely you will agree that rearing children today presents many challenges. I have certainly found that to be the case. Many parents wonder how they can follow the Bible’s advice to ‘train up a boy according to the way for him,’ found at Proverbs 22:6. A fine help for parents is this new publication </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth —Getting the Best out of It.</span><span class="font14"> Note some of these chapter titles in the table of contents. [Mention several chapters that would be of local interest.] I am sure you will find this Bible study aid a help to you as a parent in teaching your teenage children as well as something of great interest to them. [Then introduce the book.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> The following might be helpful in determining which book to offer: “We are calling because people are interested in improving the quality of daily life. May I inquire if there are any teen-age children living in the home at this time? [If so, then present </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font14"> book. If not, then continue by saying:] We have something special for youth. However, we have information that will be of great benefit to you. Many people wonder if the time will ever come as described at Revelation 21:3, 4, in the Bible. [Read verses.] Since this promise of a better life under better conditions comes from</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">&lt;$&gt;Many brothers in Spain who had been imprisoned for several years because of their integrity were recently released from prison due to an amnesty proclaimed by the king of Spain. It is reported that many of them will return to full-time service in the Spanish field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">^Mexico reports a new peak of 84,065 publishers for June. It would have been even better but, due to heavy rains and flooding in many parts of the country, they have not received 240 reports. Although some brothers lost their belongings, none have lost their lives and help has been provided for those in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">$ Although there are still about 27 congregations to report for June, in Benin the number of Bible studies being conducted is reported as 270, which is an increase of 18 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font0">Upper Volta is happy to report 62 publishers, their 7th new peak in the service year. This represents a 41-percent increase over last June. A new peak of 3,312 in magazine placements was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Question</span><span class="font15"> ar</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O Is it proper that the body of elders arrange for musical accompaniment for congregational singing other than using the Society’s recordings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is a matter for decision by the body of elders. Accompaniment for singing does help the congregation to sing well. Some congregations may not have record players to use in playing the Society’s recordings. Where qualified persons with musical talent are available, many congregations prefer to have piano or other instrumental accompaniment. It would not be good to try to use someone who does not really know how to play an instrument well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When recordings are used, care should be used to replace worn-out or damaged records, thus maintaining the high standard of the meetings that should be found in the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">MARCH 1976</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 19, No. 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Q)ea/c <sup>&lt;</sup>EKiitgc(om ^PuMislie/ts:</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">For us March and April always prove to be busy and happy months. We all look forward to the special activities arranged. Have you considered temporary pioneering for a month, or even for two weeks? It will be an ideal time for many to enroll as temporary pioneers, especially young folks who will be on school vacation for a few days. Last March over 9,000 enrolled, and in April, over 17,000. Perhaps many more will be able to serve as temporary pioneers this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not talk it over as a family or with several others in the congregation? Parental encouragement may be just what is needed to help many young ones to taste the joys of temporary pioneering. One young sister wrote the Society: “With much encouragement from my family and with Jehovah’s blessing, I found that I could pioneer a half day of each school day. It really sharpened my appreciation of the privilege and joy of serving Jehovah and helping people in these last days. In addition it has served as a protection from the influences of worldly schoolmates.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, pioneer service brings blessings! Recently, after a zone visit to the branches in Mexico and Central America, Brother Knorr particularly mentioned that missionaries from early classes of Gilead are still serving there. That means that they have enjoyed full-time service, as pioneers and in Bethel homes, for over thirty years! In Mexico, Brother Knorr said, 81,371 persons are now publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While some of us may not be able to be pioneers, all of us can continue to encourage the youths and share with them in the increased service activities at this time of the year. May your blessings be many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brothers, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Encourage the Young People Among Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> There is a large percentage of youthful ones in the congregations. These young people certainly need and deserve the encouragement of older ones, and their help in making advancement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah God himself views with great interest and joy the young people who serve faithfully. (Luke 18:16) Remember how he backed up young Daniel and his companions. They were transported by an enemy king to a faraway land, where paganism and nationalism were dominant. But did these young people break integrity or keep silent as to their belief in Jehovah’s sovereignty? Did Jehovah forsake them? The Scripture account says: “As for these children, the four of them, to them the true God gave knowledge and insight in all writing and wisdom.” As a result it became evident even to the king that the wisdom that they had was far superior to that of all the priests of Babylon.—Dan. 1:17-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> We can be sure that, while those four Jewish boys were still at home, their parents had given special care to see that they developed spiritual strength, for the family arrangement was one of the most important features of Israelite life. Parents and other adult members of the congregation, are you helping the young persons among you to become real praisers of God? What can you do?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">Engage in Memorial-Season Activity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Once every year Jehovah’s, people have an occasion for very special observance. This is the Memorial of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus has been resurrected into the heavens. Having there presented the value of his sacrifice, he owns all humankind. As God’s high priest he administers life-giving benefits to all who call upon God with faith in his sacrifice. We can look for his help in every time of need.—Heb. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Certainly such a provision of our Father Jehovah is something to be thankful for, and the commemoration of this sacrifice with all it means is something to advertise to the widest possible extent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> To help truth-seeking persons to know about God’s life-giving provision, special arrangements have been made for this Memorial season. On Sunday, March 28, seventeen days before the celebration of</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Do not take their efforts for granted. Young people have proved to be a real asset to congregations. Many, by their fine conduct, have ‘adorned the teaching of our Savior, God.’ (Titus 2:6-10) This has given an effective witness to schoolteachers and others. Youths who manifest Christian behavior at conventions have glorified Jehovah and have brought greater respect for Jehovah’s witnesses in the community. Many young persons also do well in field service, even aiding others to take their stand for the truth. Commend them for the good they do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Ask yourself: ‘When was the last time that I stopped to talk to the young folks at our Kingdom Hall, not merely to say “Hello,” but showing genuine interest?’ In conversation with these young people you can help them to set attainable goals—not too high for them to reach at their age. It may be the goal of preparing comments for meetings, beginning to use the Bible in the field or witnessing to at least one person each week at school. Many may be able to be temporary pioneers, particularly during school vacation periods.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Also, in order that young people might realize that they are a recognized, appreciated part of the congregation, give them things to</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">the Lord’s Evening Meal, there will be a special public talk on the very appropriate subject “Who Is Jesus Christ, so that We All Need Him?” Let’s do our utmost to enable others to attend the public talk as well as the Memorial on April 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The April 15 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> also highlights our need for Jesus Christ. Free copies of this special issue will be sent to each congregation—three for each Bible study being held by congregation publishers and pioneers. If you are conducting Bible studies, you will receive, through the Bible study overseer, three copies for each of your studies. As you give them to the Bible student, encourage him to give them to people at work, to relatives, neighbors and so forth.

I am making brief calls on neighbors this morning to share with them God’s promise of a world without crime [other conditions could be used, if preferred]. Of course, conditions are getting so bad today that many sincere people are saying, ‘Where is all of this heading? Will things ever get better?’ Perhaps you have given this some thought, too. [Permit reply, if nerson inclined.] Did you know that Jesus foretold the very things we are experiencing today? Note his words here as quoted from the Bible. [Hand extra copy of March 15 issue to householder and, after directing attention to quotation of Luke 21:25, 26, 28 on page 163, read from your copy.] Note, while Jesus knew these bad times were coming, he gave a real basis for hope.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark7"></a>&quot;Sacred Service&quot; District Assemblies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">N</span><span class="font5">EARLY a million worshipers of Jehovah and interested persons in the United States are looking forward to the summer of 1976 with keen anticipation. Why? Because of the spiritual blessings they know are in store for them at the district assemblies being arranged. Ninety-four assemblies are planned for the continental United States this s</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font5">er.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Think of what it will mean to attend one of these assemblies! While here you are away from most contact with worldly people and can enjoy to the full the association of your brothers. Their speech is wholesome and they desire to improve their spirituality. That is one thing that makes assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses so outstanding, for at them one can witness Christian principles in operation on a major scale. Besides receiving counsel and instruction through the convention program, everyone present will be a recipient of the spirit of the occasion. Also, God’s spirit will be there. This one fact alone makes attending worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, to see thousands of people working together out of love, willingly giving of themselves without pay, is a profound blessing in this day and age. To behold men, women and children singing together, learning and praying together is uplifting and faith-strengthening. What joy these large gatherings bring to all of Jehovah’s people! Will you, too, be present this summer to show your appreciation? Our prayer is that everyone will be able to attend an assembly. The following information is being provided to assist you to benefit to the full from the fine provisions made at each convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OUR CHRISTIAN CONDUCT: How we conduct ourselves while attending assemblies is very important. Not only does good conduct make things pleasant for others, but it can serve as a fine witness to outsiders. (1 Pet. 2:12) Any who accept our invitation to attend the assembly ought to be able to see by our conduct that we truly reflect unselfish love and concern for others. Thus it is good to remind ourselves of the importance of being thoughtful and considerate. We are Jehovah’s people. When we get together we want to reflect this fact wholeheartedly, both at the assembly grounds and throughout the assembly city. (Col. 3:23) By the way we conduct ourselves we bring honor or dishonor to Jehovah’s great name. By being patient, cooperative and taking the lead “in showing honor to one another,” we will cause others to say, “God is really among you.” (Rom. 12:10; 1 Cor. 14:25) Remember, Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) Love, unselfish consideration for others, is essential in operating the assemblies of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of situations arise at conventions where we have the opportunity to manifest our Christian love and consideration for others. For example, the Society has for a number of years worked diligently to arrange for convention sites having ample capacity to seat all who were expected to attend. At most assemblies this has worked out successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, it has been noted that even at the many facilities where there are far more seats available than those actually in attendance, there still has often been a problem for persons desiring to find a seat in which to sit. Many times they have been unable to find a seat because someone has needlessly put something on the seat beside him either to save it or to serve as a place to keep his belongings. How thoughtful and considerate, yes, loving, to keep our belongings under our own seat, on our lap or in the checkroom so that those who are looking for seats will know what seats are available without having to ask as they walk along the aisles. It shows courtesy to occupy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only one seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A balanced view, of course, would indicate that in certain instances some could save a seat or two for good reason. Families may need seats together; volunteer workers may be coming to sit with their families soon after the sessions begin; individuals may momentarily leave to go to the washroom; also, interested persons may be coming to occupy seats next to Witnesses who have arranged to sit with them. The loving thing in such instances would be to save the seats for a reasonable length of time. However, when we place objects on blocks of seats for persons in our congregation or others who are capable of finding seats for themselves, is this showing love for those who really need seats at that time? Is this “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others”?—Phil. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past, seats have sometimes been saved and never occupied during an entire session. People were forced to stand or go to a place where they could not see or even hear well, thereby missing that whole portion of the program. Thus, if we are holding a seat or two and the session starts, our Christian conscience should move us to relinquish any seats we are saving, unless we know that those who were sitting there will return soon. Please cooperate with the attendants in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has also been observed that at some facilities numbers of brothers have arranged to be at the gates or doors of the convention building by five or six o’clock in the morning so that they would be there when the building opened and could rush in to save whole sections of seats, very often the very choicest ones, by laying magazines and books on them. When we stop to think about this, could we say that doing this truly reflects well upon our Christian personality? Truly, at an assembly of Jehovah’s people the principle prevailing should be that “love . . . does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests.” (1 Cor. 13:4, 5) How refreshing it is, instead, to see others, including younger persons, freely offer their seats to elderly or infirm persons who may not have found a place to sit and listen. By such loving concern for others we honor our God, Jehovah, who has taught us what love really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During sessions, it is important to remember others around us and to be considerate. If we engage in conversation with family and friends while the program is going on, we not only miss vital instruction ourselves but also disturb others nearby. Endeavor to plan each day’s activities so that, when the sessions begin, you will be in your seat and ready to give full attention to the spiritual food that</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM SERVICE, MARCH J976</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has arranged. If a small child begins to cry, and you are unable to quiet him after a few moments, it shows loving consideration to take him to an area where he will not disturb others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When children are sitting with their parents at assemblies and paying attention, this is a fine thing to see. But this is not something that can be left to chance. As parents, do we always arrange to have our children sit with us and keep them with us, even before and after the sessions? Or do we just let them roam around the assembly grounds at will? Attendants have had to speak to such children and even take them to their parents and explain what they have done. Even children of Witness parents have a few times thoughtlessly or deliberately committed acts of vandalism or involved themselves in mischief that has harmed persons and property. This, of course, results in detracting considerably from the good name of Jehovah and his people, to the point of actually at times bringing reproach on the organization, thus requiring that local elders look into such matters. So why not make a real effort to keep your children with you at the assembly and help them to enjoy its blessings even more by your loving companionship? (Deut. 6:7; 31:12) In this way the good conduct of our children will also bring praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are other occasions also when our good conduct at assemblies reflects favorably on us and our Creator, Jehovah. If others are waiting in line at a food or literature counter, how fine it is to avoid crowding in front, but rather wait patiently for our turn or even perhaps offer our place to someone in need of extra consideration. Occasionally we may see a new person or a child who does not display Christian qualities as fully as we feel he should, but instead of losing our Christian composure, we should look upon it as an opportunity to set the example for such ones in Christian kindness and patience. We realize that they lack experience and it is our hope that by their being at the assembly and listening and learning from the example of mature servants of Jehovah they will eventually progress in Christian stature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sharing in keeping the assembly grounds clean is a good way that we can set an example of cleanliness. It is helpful if we not only dispose of any trash in the proper receptacle, but also look under seats and elsewhere after the sessions are over to pick up what may have been dropped and dispose of it properly. This is the loving thing to do also in consideration of those who have volunteered for cleaning the premises, making their job easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By far the majority of Jehovah’s witnesses, both young and old, at such large assemblies have proven themselves to be fine Christians in conduct and attitude and this has not gone unnoticed by others, even those outside of the organization. Note the comments made by the supervisor in charge of a coliseum in Arizona at an assembly last year: “You seem like one big family, an organized group, not like five thousand kids running mayhem around the building. I don’t know how you people do it! Your children are very well mannered, not many children crying like at other events. You folks are really special. I hope you come back and use our facilities again, come back again, please.” A security guard for the same coliseum said: “Your surroundings are clean and no one throws trash on the floor, children even put their papers in the trash receptacle. The children are well behaved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such experiences show us that when we reflect the fruitage of God’s spirit in all our activities and especially at our conventions, Jehovah’s great name truly is honored by what we do. Christian love on the part of both young and old as expressed by good manners, which may include saying ‘Thank you,’ apologizing, etc., will also work toward the enjoyment of the assembly by everyone. (Compare Exodus 4:10; Genesis 18:27; 19:2.) Many other fine points on our conduct in such matters are discussed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of June 15, 1970, under the heading “Showing Love for One Another at Assemblies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO WEAR?: </span><span class="font5">Another way in which we can contribute to the fine atmosphere of the assembly is to dress appropriately for the occasion. Remember, many new ones are in attendance at assemblies. They have been told that Jehovah’s witnesses dress modestly, in good taste, and that they avoid the appearance of worldly people. But what if they now attend the assembly and find many dressed otherwise? This is one reason why it is important to dress with good taste and not according to the extreme tastes of worldly people. If you are doubtful that some kind of dress would be appropriate, then it is best not to wear it. By following good standards of modesty you can help to adorn the assembly in a spiritual way.—1 Tim. 2:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ROOMING: During April the Society will send a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation, on which will be printed the address of the rooming headquarters for each assembly. This will be in ample time for all to complete their arrangements to attend. Some choose to contact hotels and motels themselves and make arrangements, but often more economical arrangements can be made through the convention rooming department. When you receive your copy of the Room Request form from your congregation, please fill it out very carefully and mail it directly to the rooming headquarters address for the assembly city where you will be attending (NOT to the Society), doing so </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no earlier than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly you have selected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please send word (1) to the landlord, whose name and address are shown on your assignment card, and (2) to the convention rooming department so that the room may be reassigned. When rooming assignments are made by the convention the landlord is advised of the name and address and date of arrival of the ones assigned. Many householders purchase linens, fix up the rooms, rearrange their own families for sleeping, etc., to accommodate those coming, and they have a right to expect those assigned to be there. If one assigned is unable to take the assignment and fails to notify the landlord in advance, normally the one renting the room(s) might consider that the brother or sister actually owes the money for the room, since Christians are to be true to their word in all things. Whether you stay in a private home or hotel, be courteous and exemplary in conduct, and be considerate in using the facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There will be no trailer camps at the conventions, but the convention rooming department for each assembly will gladly furnish available information on commercial or other trailer parking facilities if there are such places available in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, the Son of God, said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (Acts 20:35) There will be ample opportunity at the assemblies to give of one’s abilities and talents to serve the needs of others. There will be plenty of opportunity for all who willingly offer themselves to work side by side with Christian brothers and sisters of various races and nationalities to care for the assembly departments and needs. Such serving, motivated by love, will cause their joy to be full, because they find pleasure in assisting their Christian brothers.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not plan to volunteer as individuals or as family groups? Younger children can work under the supervision of parents or older members of the family. Brothers having families could perhaps volunteer to serve as attendants in sections where they will be sitting with their families. If you cannot serve all four days, your doing so for any other period of time will be very much appreciated and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The department heads know that everyone wants to hear the program. So, to the extent possible, they endeavor to arrange matters so that those who volunteer are able to hear as much as possible. When there are enough volunteers, it is possible for nearly everyone to hear the entire program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Application for Volunteer Service forms should be filled out completely and signed by your presiding overseer and then </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sent to the rooming address for the convention city you will attend</span><span class="font5"> (NOT to the Society). If you later find that you are unable to serve in your assignment, please advise the volunteer service department at the assembly city of the change. During April the Society will send a supply of Volunteer Service forms to each congregation for use by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS: </span><span class="font5">Do you have room in your automobile for a pioneer, someone that does not have a car, an elderly brother or sister who needs special help, or an interested person who wants to attend? Make their joy complete as you share in this greater happiness of giving in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font5">Regardless of the assembly you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk of your car. Also, beware of pickpockets. They often mingle in large crowds. And, for the same reason, do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font5">Regular pioneers who were appointed on or before February 1, 1976, will be sent the Convention Pioneer Identification for use at a district assembly during the service year. These will be sent to the presiding overseer along with the monthly statement for May. Pioneers, be sure to bring your Convention Pioneer Identification to the assembly and treat it as cash, as no replacements will be available. It can be used to obtain the regular food tickets at the assembly. It will also be needed to obtain literature from the bookroom at pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font5">Starting the weekend prior to each assembly and on until the day before the program begins, there will be a concerted effort made in ana around the assembly city to invite the public to attend the entire program. Millions of handbills are being printed for special house-to-house distribution. Publishers living in the assembly cities and nearby will be invited to share. If you plan to travel from out of town to an assembly, could you arrange to arrive a day or two early to share in this work? 'If so, request your rooming accommodations accordingly. And on arrival at the assembly city go to the address of the rooming department for territory and handbill supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not also plan to spend some time while in the assembly city, either in the morning or in the evening, engaging in informal witnessing on your way to the sessions or when returning to your accommodations? Take advantage of every opportunity to speak about the good news and to invite everyone possible to attend the assembly, especially those in whose home you may be staying. If any of the handbills remain from the special distribution, these ihay be obtained at the bookroom and used to aid in such informal witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font5">The program for the assemblies, in most cases, will begin on Thursday morning at 9:55. Arrange to be there then. Do not miss anything on the program. At most locations, the immersion will be on Friday and those who have made a dedication and who wish to symbolize this by water baptism at an assembly should have gone over the eighty questions with the elders before convention time. Bathing suits and towels should be brought from home by each one who plans to be baptized. We encourage you to arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, when the convention closes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Please note that variations of the above schedule are that the Spanish-language assembly in Inglewood, California, on June 27-30, will have the program run from Sunday through Wednesday. Also, for the Elmont, N.Y., assembly on August 4-7 the program will run from Wednesday through Saturday and for the assembly on August 8-11 the program will run from Sunday through Wednesday. We encourage those who will attend these particular assemblies to keep in mind that the full program will be presented and so you will not miss any portion of the program by attending one of these. The baptism for the above-mentioned Inglewood Spanish-language assembly and the Elmont assemblies will be planned for the second day of each assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To assist you in making plans to attend one of the 94 district assemblies, the following chart is being provided to indicate the assembly city nearest each circuit throughout the continental United States. Therefore, to the extent possible, we recommend that you attend the convention shown for your circuit unless vacation plans or other circumstances make it more convenient for you to attend elsewhere. In some cases it is necessary to balance the size of the crowd with the seating facilities available and so some congregations in those circuits marked with an asterisk (*) may be slightly closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend the assembly indicated so there will be plenty of room. Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend a particular assembly, such as % or %, etc., it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that assembly would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly closest to them as shown on the list as well. There are also listed a number of cities where two or three assemblies are being held in succession and we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Note: It has become necessary to change the dates for the Billings, Montana, assembly from June 24-27 to July 8-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The congregation book study conductor has a part of God’s flock to care for, and he should be well acquainted with the circumstances of everyone in his study group. (Prov. 27:23) Not that he pries into their personal affairs. But he should know what each one has to face. Some of them work under difficult conditions, having little free time from their jobs; some have physical infirmities, or sick ones at home; some have unbelieving mates or families, while others enjoy more favorable conditions in a fine family of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> So the conductor concerned for the flock will try to be aware of the spiritual condition of each one. How does he get to know this? By talking personally with them at the study and at the Kingdom Hall, and by visiting their homes. Also he gets to know them by accompanying them in the field service. The field overseer, too, can assist by informing him of needs and by making the Publisher’s Record cards available for the conductor to see.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Those new ones who attend the public talk should be invited to attend the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal on April 14, after 6:00 p.m., Standard Time. Make arrangements to help them to attend. Printed Memorial invitations should also be given to others who have shown some interest. Besides those attending home Bible studies, there are persons who have taken literature or have shown some interest in conversation. Why not review your house-to-house record and make a call on each interested one. These may be shown that this special observance is the only one commanded by Jesus Christ and that all who profess Christianity should by all means be present to observe this most important event of the year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Parents may take their children on these calls, thus impressing upon the children the importance of the occasion and the need to help others to attend. Children may also bring friends and classmates.</span></p></li>

His objective is to help everyone to grow in spirituality. He wants to develop a like spirit in the brothers, namely, a real interest in the people to whom they speak. Thus, none will share in field service just to put in a report for the month, but because of their dedication to Jehovah and their love of people, wanting them to get life.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> This objective puts a responsibility upon the conductor. In giving personal help, rather than trying to take too heavy a load all at once, he will accomplish more by giving special attention to one or two persons at a time. After a person advances spiritually, the conductor can help another. Others can share in this, too. No doubt there are</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Those desiring to enter Bethel service will be interested to know that there is a new application form. Persons now being called to Bethel are asked to stay for one year as a ‘test of their fitness first,’ and at the end of that year they may request to remain and continue their service. (1 Tim. 3:10) It is hoped that many will take advantage of this privilege of full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those applying should be at least 19 years of age and not over 35. It should be kept in mind that much of the work at Bethel requires strong, healthy young men. If you are interested in serving Jehovah in this very special way, you may request an application form by writing to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.

<p><span class="font16">We rejoice with the 4,342 who symbolized their dedication by baptism this month. Also, it was gratifying to see that 12,376 more publishers shared in field service than in December 1974. However, there were other features of the report to which we can give thoughtful consideration. For example, the number of hours devoted to preaching w’as 365,674 less than one year ago. So, can we all increase our opportunities to share the good news, even though winter months make it somewhat more difficult? </span><span class="font5">other experienced publishers in the group who will be delighted to be of service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Continuing Studies Started with Booklets</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> We have been using the three new booklets for two months in starting studies, and likely by now you are just about completing one of the booklets with those who have been willing to study. What progress is it reasonable to expect at this point? That will depend to some extent on the student. But in most instances it should be evident whether they really want to get an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s ways and apply these in their own lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> If they show a sincere interest in the truth, should we assume that now they can get the spiritual food they need at the congregation meetings? No; in most cases that would not be realistic. They need </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Encourage the Young People </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font5">do at the Kingdom Hall according to their age and ability. They can be encouraged to welcome newcomers and to share in Kingdom Hall maintenance, such as cleaning and caring for the grounds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Among the youths at our meetings are some whose parents are not Jehovah’s witnesses. Have you considered making a friendly visit on the parents of these young folks? This would encourage the youths, and you might be able to aid the parents to get a better attitude toward the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> You who are parents, of course, have a special responsibility to spend time with your children, showing real interest in their spiritual growth. While helping others, do not neglect your own family. Your children need you to converse with them, to listen to them, to be interested in them, and, not simply to give them orders, but to reason with them. Help them to see how the truth applies in all the ways of life and to take real pleasure in serving Jehovah. Do this, and Jehovah will help you to keep them on the road to life.—Deut. 6:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> In making plans for field service, it would be a fine thing for parents and elders to give consideration to the youths, perhaps planning times after school as well as on weekends. As you are able, personally work with them and help them to learn how to improve their effectiveness in presenting the good news. If we encourage them now, they will be both an honor to Jehovah and a source of joy to all of us in the days to come. further personal help. It would no doubt be very beneficial to study with them the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font5"> book or perhaps </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The concluding paragraphs in each of the three booklets lend themselves well to continuing the study. First, on completing a booklet you might make a brief review of the things learned, and then ask specific questions to stimulate further interest. Be prepared with your personal copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font5">book and an extra copy. Using the table of contents, show the person that the book takes up these subjects as well as others. Instead of asking whether the individual would like to study for six months, you may find it better simply to talk about plans for next week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> As you study the book, in many cases you will find that it is best to cover the material at a moderate pace, reading each paragraph. But some persons may want to have more of a Bible discussion than a paragraph-by-paragraph study of the book. With them you might simply discuss the study questions and look up and discuss the scriptures. This will impress on their minds the fact that it is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Bible itself</span><span class="font5"> that answers the questions. As for the reading of the paragraphs, you might select just a few key ones in each study to read together. In this way, students that are able to progress quickly can be aided to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> If you have not already started a study in one of the new booklets, we encourage you to keep this as a goal. If you need help, do not hesitate to talk to the Bible study overseer, your book study conductor, or others who are sharing in Bible study work. Those who are starting studies report the following to be necessary things to getting a study started: (1) A real desire for a Bible study and prayer to Jehovah to bless your efforts to start one. (2) A good amount of house-to-house work in order to find interested ones. (3) Being alert to opportunities for starting a study. (4) Promptness in returning to follow up interest. (5) Determining what Bible subject is of interest to the individual. And (6) being enthusiastic and positive.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Fighting between opposing forces in</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Beirut, Lebanon, has forced brothers there to confine their meetings and field service to daylight hours. Meetings are held in small groups. One sister was killed by a sniper as she was hanging clothing to dry on the roof. Several brothers were abducted and later released. One was badly beaten. Some in the mountain villages were able to hold their circuit assembly. All rejoice that they can continue to praise Jehovah despite these difficulties.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Question Box</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">© Is it permissible to live in the territory of one congregation but attend meetings elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Generally speaking, it is best to attend the meetings of the congregation holding the territory where you live. In most cases this proves to be in the best spiritual interests of the family, since it ordinarily makes it convenient to attend meetings, share in field service in territory close by and take advantage of help provided by the elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is recognized, however, that individual circumstances vary. Such factors as one’s secular work schedule, having an unbelieving mate or transportation problems may lead someone to conclude that it would be more advantageous spiritually to attend another congregation. Each family head bears responsibility for his own household. After considering all the factors involved, he will have to decide what is best. He may want to discuss matters with the elders to get the benefit of their advice before he makes a decision. Perhaps they know of overlooked advantages that would result to the family in attending the congregation holding the territory where they live, or possible disadvantages that may be encountered in transferring to a neighboring congregation. Often it is easier for the congregation holding the territory to render loving assistance. And the home of the family might be used as a book study location within the congregation holding the territory. But in the final analysis, the elders will want to encourage the family head to decide in a way that will ensure the best spiritual benefits to his family. There is no reason to be critical of his decision when made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In metropolitan areas, there is often a large number of congregations located in a concentrated area. There may be a number of reasons why the elders may decide that the interests of the work would be advanced by a transfer of publishers. For example, there may be territory adjustments in connection with the formation of a new congregation, or to give additional territory to a congregation covering its assignment frequently, or to strengthen a congregation having few publishers or mature brothers to take the lead. The elders in each congregation can outline what seems to be advisable and request that each family affected consider it. In many instances, there likely will be no problems in making the suggested adjustment. Again, each family head will have to weigh all the factors and decide if such a transfer should be made. The same would be true of elders, ministerial servants or pioneers who are asked if they can transfer elsewhere to assist a congregation needing help.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 1976</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 19, No. 7 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">| FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </span><span class="font14">Q)ea/t kingdom ^PuMisk/ts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is a privilege to serve at Bethel, the hub of theocratic activity world wide. The big new press we have been expecting was delivered for erection and testing. It will help us to provide the needed literature for you brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently Brother Knorr gave us a report on the progress of the work in six countries he visited, starting in Guatemala. The brothers have been well cared for following the earthquake there, as far as food and clothing are concerned. Small homes are being built for them and Kingdom Halls repaired. Some work is also being done to expand the branch building. And at his last stop in Venezuela, Brother Knorr found the new branch construction nearly finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Expansion is also continuing in Brooklyn with the renovation of the Towers building. This work is being done by a crew of 175, including many skilled volunteers. The top four floors already have been wholly renovated and four more are being remodeled. Two dining rooms, a new kitchen, laundry, and an assembly hall are also being prepared in that building. The dining rooms will accommodate 1,000 persons, and the assembly hall over 500 when completed. At present we have over 1,700, including construction workers, as members of the Brooklyn Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bethel family also enjoy some fine association from visiting brothers at times. By the time you receive this, brothers will be here helping to prepare for the district assembly this summer, and it is always a pleasure to fellowship with the ones caring for the various departments. Even as this is written, students for Gilead are here from as far away as Australia, Morocco and South Africa. There are 26 students from six countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If some of you brothers between 19 and 35 years of age would like to share in the theocratic activities </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Be All Things to People of All Sorts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> To be helpful in our service we need to be able to talk with others. This means being adaptable, because we meet all kinds of people. Some will raise objections, saying that they have their religion or are busy or simply that they are not interested. Perhaps they have heard others speak against our work and so have closed their minds to the message before really hearing it. What can we do to help them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul apparently encountered objections also, so he used different approaches in speaking to different people. As he said: “To the Jews I became as a Jew . . . To those without law I became as without law . . . To the weak I became weak ... I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some. But I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with others.” (1 Cor. 9:20-23) Do we also try to be adaptable in speaking to the people we meet?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR THOSE WHO ARE “TOO BUSY”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Often people will interrupt our introduction, saying, “I’m busy.” It may be that the person truly is busy and would appreciate our</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Reaching Everyone with the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> How many people turn you away without even listening to what you would like to say? Might they respond with interest in the truth if a different approach were used? If you come by with the magazines time after time, they may get the impression that our goal is simply to distribute magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> However, what would be the response if you came to them with a Bible in your hand and began your conversation by discussing a scripture? Many have reported favorable results as a result of their doing this and have had enjoyable conversations with people who might otherwise just say they are not interested in the literature. By trying this you may find persons who will be pleased to talk with you about the Bible, and as you draw them out with questions you will find that you are reaching with the truth persons who showed little interest before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Some persons in territory we cover often may still not be reached with the truth due to their work schedule. For this reason it is most helpful to keep house-to-house showing consideration. In such a case we might say: “I’m sorry I caught you at a bad time. I wanted to share a thought from the Bible with you. However, since you do not have time, perhaps I can leave this (booklet, magazine or handbill) with you. Then when it is more convenient I would be happy to discuss the Scriptural thought with you.” Often people accept something when this is done in a friendly way, and they appreciate our showing consideration for the fact that they are busy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes it may suffice to assure the person that you will be brief. Some brothers look at their watch and say, “I can explain my purpose in two minutes,” and they keep their promise. Instead of trying to engage the person in a conversation, you can quickly state the purpose of your call, whether to discuss a scripture, invite the person to a public talk (and suggest they read the message on the handbill), or show them the literature so they will have something to read later. It all depends on the attitude or situation of the householder. We cannot expect all </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font1">records so that if you do not find people at home when you call, you can try again, perhaps at a different time, until you find them home. Do you do this? Some publishers even try to get in touch with people by phone and have good results. Street work also helps us.to reach people who are hard to find at home or who live in inaccessible apartments. The important thing is to reach people.—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Although your congregation territory may be covered quite often, what about the business territories? Would some of the publishers who feel qualified like to visit some of the shops in your area for a change? Or perhaps you have territories that are not worked much during winter months or that are covered infrequently due to being out of the way. Could some of these be reached during July?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> You will be interested to know that in the entire United States there are only 112 counties or parts of counties that are not currently assigned to any congregation for regular witnessing; however, all </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">that people say they are busy. This part of article may be discussed with congregation to get their suggestions on now to meet this objection. One of the suggestions may be demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk, with demonstration, in response to question, How can I help? Good to build up activity in congregation book study groups especially with regard to field service and helping new ones to learn to preach. Both brothers and sisters can help others in their own book study group. Can you help someone use the Bible more effectively? Can you help someone start making return visits, or take someone along on your Bible study? You do not have to be assigned to do this but you can invite persons who are newer or who would like a companion in service to come with you. Discuss and demonstrate how sister could help another publisher in book study group in service, especially in using Bible in field. Publisher says she has “been just offering magazines, but would like to do more.” Some would like to serve where need is greater, but there may be a great need in your home congregation to train and build up others spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font11">Interview a few publishers, both young and old if possible, as to how they share in the service. Have some in congregation been assisted to progress in service recently? If so, how? Experiences may be included if time permits. Song 57. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the Truth to Set Others Free. —John 8:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 96. Introduction, discussion of text for July 23, Matthew 13:33. We want to avoid the leaven of Christendom, help others appreciate pure teaching of truth. Mention any announcements for the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">14 min: </span><span class="font11">“Be All Things to People of All Sorts,” part 2, paragraphs 5-8. Discuss how we might reply to people who say they have their own religion. Get suggestions from congregation as to how they handle this. Good to ask several beforehand to be prepared. Perhaps reading or paraphrasing a scripture such as John 13:35, inviting a comment, would result in discussion. Also demonstrate how we might answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23 min: “Presenting the Good News— As a Teacher and Disciple-Maker.” Question-and-answer coverage. Include demonstration of publisher offering a study using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book and following through with demonstration of study for the householder. Scriptures and points from pages 17 and 18 may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font11">Interview several publishers who were previously with other religions as to how they were helped to learn the truth and why they accepted it. Song 60. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 46. Discussion of Branch Letter and Theocratic News using family setting after a meal. Mention any necessary announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Scriptural discussion on theme, “Speak Truth with One Another.” Discuss with audience such points as the following: Speaking the truth covers all aspects of life. Why is it necessary for a husband and wife to be honest and frank with each other? (Matt. 19: 5; Eph. 5:25, 28, 33: Prov. 31:11) Parents and children should communicate freely and truthfully with one another. (Ps. 34:13, 14; Eph. 6:1-4; Prov. 4:1;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 50. Discussion on attributes of Jehovah that make him worthy of our worship. Consider how these affect our lives. See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure/' </span><span class="font11">page 266.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">&quot;An Enjoyable Vacation.” Discuss with questions and answers. Theocratic activities can be a most satisfying part of our vacation. Get comments from congregation on how they have worked enjoyable theocratic activities into their vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Talk and demonstrations on how we can share our appreciation for Jehovah with others. Many will be working in unassigned or little-worked territory during the month. We want to use the Bible in talking with the people. Consider what literature would be most helpful for them. It may be the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription, or four pocket-size books for §1. It is good to have a variety of these small books with you. In many territories one pocket-size book for 25c would be appropriate. In every case consider starting a home Bible study if possible, whether with a book or a booklet. If a study is started in a distant or isolated territory it can be continued by mail if you cannot return each week. Demonstrate which offer vou feel would be most appropriate for your congregation. Have publisher use the Bible and get the householder in the conversation. Discuss fact God has a name and why it is important to know it. If </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book is being used, one of the scriptures mentioned on pages 17 and 18, such as Acts 15:14, 1 Corinthians 8:5, 6 or Psalm 83:18, might be discussed. Offer demonstration of “Bible discussion” and show the start of it as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font11">Suggest having any announcements for the congregation included in this part. The accounts report may be presented briefly. Encourage worshiping Jehovah by service on the weekend. Consider Matthew 22:37-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Elder interviews several young children, asking questions such as: What do you know about Jehovah? How can you know about him since you can’t see him? What can you do to please him? What is Jehovah doing for his people? Draw out comments from the hearts of the children, making discussion animated, spontaneous and realistic.' Song 24. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Song </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">68. </span><span class="font11">Discuss fact that all of us are invited to share in Jehovah’s service if we meet certain standards he requires. This is an undeserved kindness on his part. (Gal. 1:15, 16) Mention may be made here of service arrangements or other announcements for the congregation, also of any applicable items in Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">“Reaching Everyone with the Truth.” To be considered by questions and answers on material. Consult with brother caring for territory. Brief demonstration, with two sisters saying they always get same territory, see same people. Brother discusses with them value of house-to-house record even for magazine work, calling back to find those not at home. Even where territory is limited, there is usually plenty for all to do. Stress paragraphs that best fit local situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font11">Discussion of first part of article “Be All Things to People of All Sorts,” paragraphs 1-4. To help people learn the truth we must be able to talk to them. Objection often arises 23:22-25) Speaking truth wins Jehovah’s approval. (Zech. 8:16; Ps. 15:1-3; Prov. 6:16, 17) When corrective counsel is given, how do being forthright, kind, not avoiding issue, listening carefully, not jumping to conclusions, and giving Scriptural basis for viewpoint fit into the picture? (Gal. 6:1; Eph. 4: 32; 1 Tim. 5:1, 2) When straightforward, appropriate counsel is given, how should it be accepted? Should one be sensitive or try to justify oneself? (Prov. 12:15; Ps. 141:5) All need to be honest with one another, communicating freely. Develop understanding, which deepens Christian relationship. Also speak the words of truth clearly and honestly to those to whom we witness.—Eph. 4:15, 25; 1 Cor. 14:8-10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Questions of Interest. Discuss Question Box along with some items from Questions from Readers of general interest. May also use question that has arisen in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font11">Talk with audience participation on article from April 15, 1976, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> on “Is It Possible to Know About God?” Song 44. Prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Reaching Everyone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of these have been assigned for temporary coverage this year. If your congregation does not have territory that needs more regular coverage, perhaps a neighboring congregation would appreciate your assistance to witness to some area that seldom hears the truth. The elders are free to check with neighboring congregations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> In unassigned territory or areas where it is difficult to call often it is especially appropriate to recommend the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">subscriptions so some spiritual information will reach interested people regularly. However, you may find that persons who enjoy reading would prefer getting four pocket-size books for a contribution of $1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> In territories worked more frequently, after your Scriptural presentation, you may wish to offer one of the pocket-size books, whichever one you think appropriate, and try presenting it with the idea of starting a home Bible study. Either a book or a booklet may be used to start a study. Our objective is not just to cover territory or to leave literature but to reach the people, all of them, with the truth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">people to drop what they are doing to listen if it is not convenient when we call. In some cases we might simply ask if it would be more convenient if we were to call back a little later. Or we may have to express the hope that we can talk to them another time when it is more convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR THOSE WHO 'HAVE THEIR OWN RELIGION*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Another expression we sometimes hear is, “I have my own religion.” We can always reply that we are glad to know that, and inquire if they do not think it is good to know the viewpoint of different people and what they believe since there are so many different religions in the country. Or we might say that we are glad to know that they believe in God, adding that we have found that most people feel that regardless of the religion to which they belong, it is good to increase one’s personal knowledge of the Bible, as it contributes so much to one’s faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> One brother, in reply to those who say they have their own religion, remarks pleasantly: “Well now, we aren’t going to fall out over that, are we? After all, the religion to which a person belongs is a personal matter, don’t you agree? Our purpose is simply to encourage a study of the Bible. We are not soliciting church membership. But we feel sure that if a person learns what the Bible teaches, he or she will be a better Christian, don’t you agree? What a person does with that Bible knowledge is up to him. We would be happy to show you briefly a method of family Bible discussion that millions have enjoyed.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> If this “religious” objection is raised frequently, it may be advantageous to bring it up ourselves in our introduction, saying: “I am visiting people most of whom have their own religion. No doubt you do too, and the reason I’m stopping by is to get your viewpoint on this subject . . .”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> You may have another reply that works well for you, or you may wish to try some of these suggestions that you think would be appropriate. Since our message is important we would like to present it to the people whenever convenient. So it is good for all of us to learn how to reply to objections, not necessarily expecting to “overcome” them, but trying to be adaptable, as Paul was. We do not desire to argue with people, but as Paul explained, “I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with others.” This should be our objective also.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">An Enjoyable Vacation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Are you looking forward to taking a vacation? Whether it is for a few days, a week, or more, most of us look forward to the pleasant change a vacation brings from the usual routine of work. It is a period of refreshment and relaxation. It can also bring much satisfaction due to spending time doing things you may otherwise be too busy to do. Many find that their vacations are most enjoyable when they plan to include some theocratic activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> For example, do you find that it is difficult to do the reading and studying that you would like to do? Some have set aside a certain amount of time each day to read the Bible or other publications they want to consider. In the relaxed atmosphere during your vacation you may find it most enjoyable not only to read but also to discuss the things you are reading, perhaps as a family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Are you planning to visit some of your relatives during your vacation? If they are not in the truth it would be a fine opportunity not only to renew family ties, but also to converse about things of interest to you, what you are doing in the congregation, your convention plans, what you enjoy about the truth, etc. In the February issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font1"> we had material on the subject “Conversations Identify Us.” Perhaps your conversation will also help your relatives to appreciate the truth. If interest is shown, it may also be a fine opportunity to start a Bible study. With some you might find it good to have a study using only</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> If vacation takes you away from home, you will find it especially enjoyable to meet the brothers at their Kingdom Hall. If you do not know how to locate the Kingdom Hall in the area where you will be staying, you may find Jehovah’s Witnesses listed in the phone book or you may inquire of the Society by letter or phone and you will be informed of the time and place of meetings.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Many of us consider attending a convention the highlight of our vacation. How enjoyable it is to renew old acquaintances and make new ones at convention time, perhaps working side by side to care for some of the things that need to be done! Conventions are an important feature of our spiritual paradise, and we want to be sure to be present to take in the delightful Scriptural information that is scheduled. (Neh. 8:3, 4, 8) So in planning your vacation, if you include some theocratic activity, you will look back with pleasure over the time so wisely spent.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The foremost way to help people gain an accurate knowledge of the truth is by conducting Bible studies. Not all our efforts in this regard will be effective, as not all hearts respond to the truth, as Jesus explained in the parable of the sower. However, the more effort we put forth, the greater the results that will be obtained.—Matt. 13: 18-23; Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> If you would like to conduct a Bible study, ask yourself, When did I last offer to study with someone? How many times have I suggested it in the past month? If you did suggest a Bible study, did you try to start it right at that time, or did you say you would demonstrate it at some later time? The more we talk about the possibility and try to demonstrate it NOW, the more likely we are to have the joy of starting a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Since some of us will be presenting the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> book this month and since many people have it already, consider how you might start a study using this publication. Most people are pleased to talk about or discuss a subject that is of interest to them. Is it “Building a Happy Family Life”? Then chapter 20 would provide fine material and scriptures to discuss. If they are interested in the prospects for the future, you could use chapter one, “Grand Blessings from God Near at Hand!” Or they may be interested in the question in chapter 8, “Why Has God Permitted Wickedness Until Our Day?” Whatever it is, let us discuss what is of interest to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Some find that rather than offering a Bible “study” it sounds more acceptable to the householder if we offer to demonstrate how interesting a “Bible discussion” on a subject of their choice can be. Then they let them pick the topic that appeals most to them. You may wish to inquire what their understanding of the subject is, asking them, in the words of Jesus, “What do you think?” You can invite them to use their own Bible to see what the Scriptures say on the subject, going on to discuss the chapter.—Matt. 18:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> In conducting a study, be patient. See if you can draw out the right understanding from the student by considering the scriptures instead of telling him what the answer is. Try to reason with him so he puts the point in his own words rather than simply finding the answer in the paragraph. Do not worry about trying to cover a certain amount of material in an hour. Not all learn at the same pace. Understanding the material is the first step, but imbedding it in the heart is essential and this often takes a little longer.—Matt. 22:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Some brothers report that many persons who have studied and are desirous of baptism still have much to learn about the truth. They may have covered the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> book without really understanding some things too well. Patience, repetition and review will be helpfuh It may likely be that they would appreciate your continuing to study with them even after their baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> The need to get the truth well in mind applies also to those attending family studies. Our children are potential teachers and disciple-makers. Do you encourage your children to put what they learn in their own words, helping them to think about it and talk about it, or are you content if they can find a line or two that answers the question? Do you review with them things you have studied before? Can they tell you the answer at the end of the study without looking at the material? Just because you know the point and have studied it with them does not mean they know or remember it. Patience, repetition and review are helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> A well-conducted study will include preparation for service. Help the person to see how he can share with his friends, neighbors and relatives the things he is learning, and encourage him to do so. Discuss the need to be firm for what he believes even though others do not respond favorably. (Matt. 10:36, 37) Plan to take him along with you in the disciple-making work when you feel he is ready. By doing these things we will show that we truly are teachers and disciple-makers, and Jehovah will bless our efforts.—1 Cor 3:7.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15">^The first assembly hall for Korea was finished in Pusan in April. The brothers did most of the work themselves. It will accommodate 1,200, seated on the floor according to local custom. It wilt serve 54 congregations in the Pusan area for circuit assemblies as well as being used as a Kingdom Hall for two congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">/Ten missionary representatives of the Watch Tower Society were just deported from Benin (formerly Dahomey) in West Africa. A number of congregations have been advised by officials not to meet in their Kingdom Halls and that they must not preach the good news from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">V None of the 408 Witnesses associated with 11 congregations in the Friuli area of northern Italy were killed or injured during recent earth tremors. However, 59 families among them either lost homes in the quake of May 6 or are to have them demolished because they are no longer safe. Brothers in other parts of Italy, as well as in Germany and Austria, quickly provided adequate aid in the form of food, drink, clothing, funds and tents. The Society's branch office in Rome says, “Our brothers are receiving four times more help than other people.” Their meetings are held mostly in the tents, and they are busy preaching the good news to others in this stricken area.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">® Is it appropriate to have several contribution boxes in a Kingdom Hall, each labeled for a different purpose?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is something the local elders may decide if there seems to be some reason for the arrangement. As the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book states on page 149: “Contribution boxes are provided at our meeting places so that each one can have a part, ‘jdst as he has resolved in his heart.’—2 Cor. 9:7.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On occasion (a week or so ahead of time, if circumstances permit) the elders may recommend to the congregation that whatever contributions are received a certain night be used for relief purposes. Some may find it appropriate to have a separate contribution box to start a building fund. So matters may be handled in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is recommended that contribution boxes be provided at the various book study locations. Funds received at these locations are added to the congregation cash account and are used for Kingdom Hall expenses or for advancing Kingdom interests as the congregation may direct.</span></p>

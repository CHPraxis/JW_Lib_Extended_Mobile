<p><span class="font1">In recent months it has been our joy to see quite a number of new faces here at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some are the children of parents who themselves once served at Bethel. These parents still have fond memories of their life here, so they encouraged their children to share in the privileges that they once enjoyed. Many here were encouraged by their parents to pioneer, and this became a stepping-stone to Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other brothers among us have no relatives in the truth. As their knowledge of the truth increased, their desire to serve Jehovah to a greater extent grew. Today these brothers are at Bethel and are happy to be a part of a far larger family than they had before learning the truth.—Mark 10:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here at Bethel there are rich spiritual blessings to be enjoyed. We have association with the largest single group of the remnant of Christ’s anointed brothers on earth today. Our association all day every day is with dedicated servants of Jehovah. Newcomers enjoy a four-month course in the Bethel Entrant’s School, with classroom discussions on Monday evenings. For all of us there are the stimulating discussions of the daily text each morning and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study each Monday evening. Several of our family have been in Bethel service for more than fifty years. Others were baptized as recently as 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We encourage dedicated brothers, especially those who are single and between nineteen and thirty-five years of age, to consider prayerfully whether they could serve Jehovah and their brothers as members of the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We keep busy here and time passes very rapidly. lake you, we have plenty to do in Jehovah’s service. (1 Cor. 15:58) We send our warm love to all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brothers, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Willing to Serve?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> An extraordinary opportunity has been extended to us. It is the privilege of being Jehovah’s Witnesses. Just think what that means. We have been entrusted with God’s word, his message, for humankind. That message clearly points to the only government that can solve the problems of all mankind—God’s kingdom. And it shows how people of all kinds can gain eternal life as its subjects. What work could possibly be more important than publicly sharing this good news from God? And what could be more lastingly beneficial? There is no other!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Do we individually appreciate that privilege? Does the way in which we are using our lives show that we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah is looking for willing servants, for those motivated by appreciative hearts. (Ps. 110:3) The loving provisions that He has made for us stir us to action. (1 John 4:8-10) Yes, these provisions make us want to share in the vital work of preaching and teaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Jesus Christ said that this work is to continue until “the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Success with Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Recently we heard some interesting experiences related by two married couples who have had outstanding success in conducting home Bible studies. With the help of God’s spirit, each couple has aided between 250 and 300 persons to become dedicated praisers of Jehovah. We thought you would be interested in some of the things that they do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> In each case, the husband and wife care for studies as a team. They are willing to start a study with anyone, but their aim is to involve the entire family, and they find that this is easier when they make their return calls together. They really work at this. So, instead of studying with just one person at a time, more &lt;&nbsp;ften they are studying with couples or with family groups.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> As for the studies themselves, these are never cut-and-dried sessions, with the conductor simply asking questions and having the paragraphs read. The publishers are enthusiastic about the truth. They help people to see the value of what they are discussing. After an hour of study the people are usually surprised at how quickly the time has gone. They do not want the study to end; they have end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) Though obviously close, the end of the old system has not yet arrived. Are we personally giving this work the emphasis that it deserves?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITED IN WORSHIP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> When a person offers </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font1">elf in Jehovah’s service, no one sets for him a quota of hours that he is supposed to spend in sharing the good news with others. But we need to be careful not to miss the point. Jesus clearly said that Jehovah is looking for those who worship “with spirit.” (John 4:23, 24) That is, they are spirited in their worship; they reflect a spirit that is appropriate to the worship of the true God. In answering the question of a man who wanted to know what was required in order to gain eternal life, Jesus showed that, first of all, one must be whole-souled in serving Jehovah. (Luke 10:25-28) That is encouraging, because it indicates that God does not evaluate us by what others are able to do; each one gives of himself according to what he as a soul </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font1">become engrossed in the discussion and want more. Where possible, the publishers stay and continue the discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BE GENUINE FRIENDS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> It is important, they feel, to be genuine friends of the people. They find that when people share a meal together, it contributes to a feeling of confidence. So, when they get a study established, they invite the couple over for a meal, and they keep in touch with them by phone during the week, answering questions and relating items of interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> These publishers know that it is important for them to keep their appointments, and they expect the same from those on whom they call. If some do not do it, the publishers do not just pass it off. They endeavor to sit down and talk seriously to them about it. They let them know that this work is important, that it is not just a casual thing. If the people do not respond, they drop the study. Sometimes, of course, people are at home for the study but there is not much interest. The publishers work hard to reach their hearts. But within a month or two, if they are not responding, the pub-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Work of Disciple-Making</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 1. Any needed local announcements; then Scriptural discussion. A key part of our work is the making of disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) One of the most enjoyable aspects of our activity. Not everyone to whom we preach is going to become a disciple, and simply giving a witness to people of all kinds is important. But God’s will includes more. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Every day, in all our contacts, and whenever we are in field service, we should be looking for potential disciples and then be sure to follow through. Using following texts as time permits, ask audience where these interested ones were found: Matt. 9:9; Luke 10: 38-42; John 4:6, 7, 39; Acts 16:26-34. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Ideas for Field Service. Let us make it our goal to start Scriptural discussions wherever possible. Discuss and demonstrate the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After greeting householder, you might say: 'It is true that people need many things, but what do you think is mankind’s greatest need?' Listen to what householder says, show interest in it, and then direct attention to Kingdom as the solution. Read a scripture, perhaps Isaiah 9:6, 7. Then, with a view to stimulating interest in a regular Bible study, direct attention to pages 7 and 8 of book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—From What Source?</span><span class="font12"> Read and discuss whatever portion seems to be appropriate. If householder has Bible, encourage him to get it and show him how to use it to look up references. If householder indicates that he is too busy for a discussion today, then offer the book, but tell him that you would like to continue the discussion. Ask whether there is another time that would be more convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Discuss field service arrangements for the week; encourage all to share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Success with Bible Studies.” After reading each paragraph ask for comments from audience to highlight the main thoughts. Encourage inviting others to meetings of local congregation; briefly comment on why the public talk this week is something that will benefit both us and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">What We Are Doing. Ask: ‘How many here have ever conducted a Bible study?’ ‘How many would like to do so?’ Tell what is being done locally, as shown by reports. Have discussion with audience, drawing from them suggestions on (1) where to find studies, (2) how to start them. Ask those now conducting studies how they got them started. Interview one or two publishers who do well with Bible studies, drawing out encouraging experiences they have had; these should be selected and reviewed in advance. Isolate a few practical suggestions from the comments they make; repeat these. In conclusion, mention again Matthew 28:19, 20; emphasize latter part of verse 20. Song 101.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 32. Serving, Not Position, Is Important. Scriptural discussion based on Matthew 20:20-28 and John 13:2-5. Narrate these accounts, reading short portions and commenting on them, also inviting comments from audience. Make application; (1) Keeping Kingdom Hall clean. (2) Bethel service; include information from Branch Letter. (3) Having a full share in house-to-house activity. Outline field service arrangements for the week. (4) Doing things in a personal way for our brothers; Gal. 6:10; John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font12">Accounts report. Commend the willing spirit reflected among Jehovah’s people; illustrate with Exodus 35:5; 36:5-7, also </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1976 Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> p. 211, fi3. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Are You Willing to Serve?” Audience participation, include any needed local announcements here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Presenting the Good News —When People Say, ‘I’m Not Interested.’ ” Connect with preceding meeting parts by showing that, in addition to being </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">willing</span><span class="font12"> to serve, it is also important to be </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">prepared.</span><span class="font12"> Read paragraphs, then ask questions. Demonstrate some suggestions; then ask audience what was done and why. Encourage those who conduct meetings for field service to review these points with their groups before going into the field both </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font12"> week and, next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Conclude with brief comments on quality of offerings that were required under the Mosaic law and the fact that our offerings of praise in the field should also be of high quality. (Deut. 15:21; Mal. 1:8; Heb. 13:15) Encourage all to prepare and to share in field service this week; invite all to coming meetings. Song 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 20. “Fine ‘Workers at Home.’ ” Practical discussion built around Proverbs 31:10-31, as discussed in July 1, 1976, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> From main points of the article, select those that would be most beneficial for general discussion in your congregation. With questions, draw comments, particularly from sisters, as to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">how Bible principles govern them in specific matters as they care for the interests of their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font12">Question Box. Theocratic News. Needed local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font12">“Should You Vary Your Initial Approach?” After reading each paragraph ask questions to highlight main thoughts. Demonstrate several suggested approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font12">Pitfalls to Bible Studies’ Becoming Successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bible study overseer asks if brothers have ever stopped to analyze most common reasons why persons stop studying. He then has series of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">fast-moving </span><span class="font12">interviews with persons representing individuals who discontinued their studies. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Keep each one very brief; </span><span class="font12">cover all five, or as many as you believe will be most beneficial locally. After each brief interview, have someone in audience ready to read scripture and then very briefly discuss solution with audience. (Emphasize how to overcome problem in each case.) First interview woman who discontinued study because it was not conducted regularly. Woman did not know when publisher was coming. (Read 1 Corinthians 14: 40.) Another student stopped after learning a few basic Bible truths. While she had head knowledge, heart was not touched. (Read Proverbs 4:23; you might also </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">briefly</span><span class="font12"> comment on key thoughts in paragraphs 10, 11, 13 and 14 on pages 76 and 77 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook.)</span><span class="font12"> Still another enjoyed study, but not prepared for opposition from relatives and neighbors. (Read 2 Timothy 3:12; also point out that information in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, page 16, paragraphs 12 and 13, may be used to help a beginning student.) Next, a woman stopped because publisher not prepared. After reading question, publisher kept eyes buried in book until householder answered questions. Felt she was not being taught. (Read Romans 2:21.) Another woman was studied with who had a family, but other family members were never invited to sit in. Publisher would hardly speak when other family members entered room. Husband, not understanding what was taking place, encouraged wife to discontinue study. (Read Galatians 5:22 [kindness], also Romans 12:13b.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font12">Comments on 1 Corinthians 9:19-23, with application to field service. Brief comments to whet appetite for upcoming meetings. Song 89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 22 Preparing as a Family for Christian Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 63. Talk and discussion with audience on importance of family study. Draw material from February 15, 1971, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower,</span><span class="font12"> pages 104-107. Might include some interviews. Emphasize giving thought to what would be most beneficial for the family to study together, also how to do the studying so that the family will really understand it and be able to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cover any needed local announcements here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">35 min: </span><span class="font12">Getting Ready for School. (One brother may be assigned to handle this portion of the meeting, or the assignment may be divided among several brothers.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(8 min.) Start with father talking to his son about going back to school. Son is not very enthusiastic about it; so father reasons with him as to why important: A legal requirement, and obedience to law affects one’s relationship with God. (Titus 3:1, 2) Bible encourages learning to read and speak well, to be able to work with our hands to support ourselves and our families; knowledge of history and current events can help us when witnessing, to aid others to appreciate fulfillment of prophecy and need for Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Son says he gets discouraged by the atmosphere, the disrespect for teachers and others; and the fact is, all the students know that some of the teachers do not live very good lives. Father refers back to Titus 3:2; also shows that apostle Paul was respectful even toward </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> king who was known to be immoral. (Acts 26:2; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Aid,</span><span class="font12"> p. 760, £4) By respectful attitude we give a witness, honor Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(17 min.) Discuss with young folks in the audience the situations that arise in school that put their Christianity to the test. Ask them in advance to offer suggestions; take these up on the meeting. Might consider birthday parties, Halloween, school ceremonies, use of drugs and smoking styles of dress, and so forth. In each case ask the young folks why we take the position we do; explain from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(10 min.) Opportunities to Witness. Ask audience wnat opportunities there are in school to witness. Demonstrate witnessing to fellow students: one scene may be fairly short, just conversation; another more extensive, using Bible. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">In conclusion, point out that what we have done here tonight is something that can beneficially be done frequently in our own homes. Comment on Deuteronomy 6:6, 7. Show that instruction from God’s Word should not be reserved only for formal study periods but can be a natural, enjoyable part of everyday life. Song 73.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SBimslsi Vobi Vary ¥oar DcraSuSoO Approach?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Our first objective in going from house to house is to gain an attentive ear. In frequently worked territory, many publishers find it helpful to vary their initial approach when covering the same area. Of course, there is no reason to change something that works well for you. However, if you seldom get past your opening words, you may find the need to vary what you say initially.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> How might this be done? You might say: “I would like to leave this printed message on the subject [read subject on back of handbill and offer to householder].” Then use the topic you feature from the handbill as a basis for your Scriptural presentation. The reverse side of the handbill may highlight such scriptures as Revelation 21:4; Matthew 24:3 and Micah 4:3, 4. An interesting conversation could be built around any of these texts. Especially in territories where the handbill has not been commonly used to introduce the message, it may capture the householder’s interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Questions, too, can arouse interest. You might ask: “What do you think might be done to upgrade the quality of life today?” Or, “What do you feel is mankind’s greatest need at present?” Another question could be: “If you could remedy just one problem facing mankind, what would</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Success with Bible Studies (Cont’d) </span><span class="font1">lishers use their time elsewhere. These brothers work to support their households, their time is limited, and they want to spend it where it will do the most good. In one town, one of these couples had forty-six studies in a period of eight months, none of which developed. But because they did not waste a lot of time with those who really lacked appreciation, they were able to help those who really wanted the truth. Eight other studies in that area yielded productive Witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> To get people to congregation meetings, they start talking about these right away. Especially do they endeavor to stimulate interest by mentioning questions that are going to be answered at a particular meeting. They ask whether that interests the couple; if so, they urge them to come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Week by week they bring along things designed to acquaint newly interested ones with the organization. Sometimes there are newspaper clippings about the Witnesses, perhaps a convention reyou change?” Then use a scripture that fits the householder’s thinking, ultimately drawing attention to the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> A question, along with an illustration in a publication, might attract immediate interest. For example, you could point to the picture on page four of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth. </span><span class="font1">book and ask: “Would you like to live in a place like the one pictured here?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> In varying our approach, we might also consider when we call. By varying the time of the day and the day of the week, we may be able to meet members of a household who seldom hear the good news. We may find that certain times and days are more convenient for such people and they may be more willing to listen. Have you considered working from house to house or following up not-at-homes on Saturday afternoons? Or, what about doing such service in the early evening hours when many are at home and in a relaxed frame of mind? If we can make some adjustment in our schedules, possibly more sheeplike ones could be located.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> From time to time, it is good to analyze our approach to see if adjustments would be beneficial in aiding us to start more conversations, and would enable us to have more opportunities to declare the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">port from years past, or a scrapbook with pictures relating to the organization and people in it. These publishers are enthusiastic about the organization; the newly interested ones respond, and, where possible, an early visit to Bethel further stimulates their growing enthusiasm.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> To avoid needless stumbling blocks, they tell people from the start that Jehovah’s Witnesses are just normal people with imperfections, that they should not expect to find perfect people in the congregation, but that they will find people who love Jehovah and want to serve him, people who pray for forgiveness when they make mistakes and who try to improve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> In the past thirty years, most of their new studies have come from the house-to-house work along with revisits, also from contacts as a result of secular work and from referrals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> In summing matters up, they say that what is needed is to be willing to give of oneself all the time, not just an hour a week. It is not just a matter of “here are</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">o At the meeting of the body of elders early in September arrangements should be made for rotation of assignments of oversight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">o The one who has been presiding overseer for the past year is to prepare a year-end report, read it to all the elders and send it to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">© After new assignments of oversight have been worked out, it would be appreciated if the elder who filled any given position during the past year would arrange to spend time with the newly assigned brother to acquaint him with details concerning the work. Additionally, each one would do well to study carefully details concerning his assignment as set out in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">When People Say, “I’m Not InJerested”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup>What do you say to a householder who immediately tells you: “I’m not interested”? When this objection is raised, we need to exercise discernment. If you can ascertain the reason for the householder’s comment and respond accordingly, you will be more likely to succeed in continuing with your presentation of the good news. Ask yourself, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font1"> does he say it? Adamantly? sincerely? firmly? What is his tone of voice, his manner or bearing? Any one or more of these things may be clues as to what is in his heart.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> While we do not want to be easily turned aside, if we are overly insistent or “pushy” we may leave an unfavorable impression, which will make it more difficult for the next Witness who calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> If you detect that the householder will not talk with you, you might simply leave a handbill. If his statement is not so firm, you might ask: “Are you interested in knowing why someone you do not know is coming to your door, especially when no doubt you realize it’s not an easy thing to do? [Pause for reply.] Let me </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leave </span><span class="font1">you with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font1"> Scriptural thought as to why.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> One brother tries to get a conversation started by inquiring: “Oh, you’ve had Jehovah’s Witnesses call at your home before, haven’t you?” He advises: “If they answer Yes, that’s the beginning of a conversation!” If the householder says he is still not interested, the brother goes to the next door. Another brother responds: ‘Many say that, but possibly you would be interested to know that very soon now all wickedness will be removed from the earth. Note what is stated here . . . ’ In this way he endeavors to stimulate interest.</span></p>

At the same time, it puts us to the test, because it calls on us to show what is really in our hearts, to use our entire life in a way that is consistent with the love for God that we profess.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> It is noteworthy that those who are described in the book of Revelation as surviving the “great tribulation” are those who ‘are rendering sacred service to God day and night.’ (Rev. 7:9, 10, 14, 15) They are not simply interested observers. They are not merely Kingdom Hall attenders. Every aspect of their lives is built around their relationship with God. Is that true of us as individuals?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> We surely want it to be so in our case. But some may realize that adjustments need to be made.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> When the householder recognizes you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you might say: ‘I find that some people aren’t much interested in other religions, but many are interested in the Bible. [Pause.] That’s what I came to discuss.’ Another reply might be: ‘Your remark is not unusual, because there is a general lack of interest in religion today, but this doesn’t mean you have no interest in the Bible itself, does it? Many people we meet still have confidence in the Bible.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Some find it helpful to bring up the objection before the householder does, by saying: ‘I am looking for people who still love God and what he has to say at a time when many say they are not interested.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> These suggestions can be adapted or adjusted to your personality so they are natural for you. When handling such objections show by your manner that you are calling as a friend and are interested in the householder as an individual. A concerned, kind voice often serves to relax the householder. Also, if you can get him to talk and express himself, he will be less defensive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>s</sup> Our concern is to find God’s “sheep” and our methods should attract reasonable persons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Many fine suggestions are being offered this summer at the “Sacred Service” District Assemblies to aid us in every aspect of our service to God. Now, while that counsel is fresh in mind, is a good time for all of us to make diligent effort to apply it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Clearly, there is work to be done in extending the word of life to others. The question for each one to ask himself is, Am I willing to serve?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">^We are glad to report that in Mozambique the brothers were able to celebrate the Memorial in the Milange refugee camps. An incomplete report shows 15,697 in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">From Sierra Leone comes a report of a new peak of 1,200 publishers; one out of every four engaged in pioneer activity. The Memorial attendance (triple the peak of publishers) and new peaks in return visits and Bible studies give promise of further increases to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For the third consecutive month Israel reports a new peak in publishers; 276 shared in field service in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">+ In Papua New Guinea a new peak of 711 reported field service. The greatest witness ever given there in a single month was accomplished as 13,864 hours were spent in the service. New territories are opening up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There has been excellent response to the distribution of “Kingdom News” No. 22. Here in Brooklyn we have received requests for 9,317 booklets. The responses were over two and a half times as numerous as those following any other of these campaigns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• What might be done to assure that our service meetings conclude with emphasis on spiritual matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When a service meeting concludes with a fine Scriptural discussion or with practical counsel for our field service, it has a wholesome effect on all of us. But, as we know, this meeting not infrequently ends with an extensive list of announcements, many of which are quite similar from week to week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, there are announcements that need to be made, but with some forethought perhaps many of these could be handled in other ways. Might reminders about cleaning the Kingdom Hall, for example, be given at the book study locations to the groups assigned for that week? Details concerning plans for field service may, at times, be fitting at the end of a meeting, but often they could be included in an earlier portion of the service meeting program that directly discusses field service. Also, if some portion of the meeting includes thoughts about showing loving concern for fellow Christians, might not this be a good place to work in any needed remarks about visiting any publishers who may be ill or in need of encouragement? If there are miscellaneous announcements that really need to be handled and that do not fit the program for the evening, why not simplv take a few minutes for them toward the beginning of the meeting, perhaps during or after one of the earlier parts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In this way, the conclusion can be used for upbuilding Scriptural exhortation, for warm encouragement to share in field service, for review of fine points learned and perhaps for some brief thoughts to whet everyone’s appetite for the forthcoming public talk and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study. It is beneficial to have a well-qualified brother handle this part.</span></p>

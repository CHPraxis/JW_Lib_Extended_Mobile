<p><span class="font1">APRIL 1976</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Vol. 19, No. 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">__FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA _</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Q)ea/t ^Kingdom ^PuMisfw/iS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Since the earthquakes in Guatemala many calls have been received at Brooklyn about our brothers there. Though the tremors were severe, we are thankful to Jehovah that not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been reported killed. A number of injuries were sustained, such as broken arms, and the injured are being given attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Damage to property has been great. Many brothers’ homes have been damaged and several Kingdom Halls made of adobe were knocked down. The Society’s branch building was not damaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Food, water, clothing and fuel were immediately taken to Guatemala City by the brothers from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Supplies have also been taken in from Mexico. Funds were sent in from El Salvador and Brooklyn, where the Society maintains a fund for disaster relief work. As needs are reported, appropriate relief will be sent to the stricken areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here in Brooklyn it has been exciting to receive reports about work in starting studies with the booklets. Among them, a circuit overseer in Florida wrote: “The new booklets are going like hot cakes. . . . One sister started six new studies during the week of our visit.” In New Jersey a circuit overseer reports that during one week the congregation he visited began 27 new studies and the following week the next congregation started 24 new studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The presses have been busy here. Over ten million booklets were produced in the first printing. Since then, the orders have been so numerous that we’re now on the fifth printing, which will bring the total up to eighteen million!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers report that it is very easy to start conversations using the warm appeal and convincing logic featured in the booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font3"> 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Manifest Your Appreciation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> When you genuinely appreciate something good, don’t you show that by your attitude and actions? Regarding the goodness and loving-kindness that Jehovah extends to us through Jesus, the apostle Paul exclaimed: “Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.” (2 Cor. 9:15) But consider, was that merely talk on Paul’s part? Not at all. In a multitude of ways he manifested his deep appreciation to God. Paul’s actions, how he lived his life, displayed his gratitude toward God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Do we not also have much for which to be thankful? Jehovah has given us life now as well as the hope of living forever in paradise. Even now, walking in the way of truth has brought us the priceless blessings of peace of mind, much security in a close relationship with fellow Christians and the assurance that our material needs will be filled. The majority of mankind remain unthankful toward one another. Worse still, they show no gratitude toward God. (2 Tim. 3:2) In contrast, our genuine appreciation should move us to express our thankfulness joyfully.—Ps. 107:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW APPRECIATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The public declaration of our hope gives a most convincing evidence of our appreciation to God. It manifests our intense love for God and neighbor. Such displays of gratitude are very pleasing to Je-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Magazines to Build Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Our efforts in the preaching work are directed toward making disciples. Over the years, Jehovah’s people have used a wide variety of means to do that. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W atchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines have played a large role in achieving the marvelous increase that now brings us so much joy. Jehovah’s direction has resulted in their effective use in building faith in the hearts of sincere people the world over. His blessing encourages us to keep using them to the full, making them regularly available to still greater numbers of people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> We appreciate that the distribution of magazines has not been our sole objective. Rather, we rejoice over the part they have had in building up enduring qualities in persons as part of the disciplemaking work. (1 Cor. 3:10-15) Our aim is to help people, and magazines are useful in doing that. Is that what you have in mind when you share in magazine work? When hovah. (Ps. 147:1, 11) Any reasonable effort to increase such public declaration is sure to receive his blessing. Thankfulness should prompt us to be whole-souled, doing the best we can. That viewpoint often causes many to think seriously about how they might take up the pioneer service.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Some thoughtful reflection may cause you to view’ it as something your circumstances will permit. Ask yourself: Am I convinced that my present effort is all I can do? Since I really want to manifest my appreciation to God and see others saved, is there some way that I can become a pioneer? Why not talk to an experienced pioneer or the circuit overseer, who may be able to give helpful suggestions on scheduling time, finding part-time work or getting someone with whom to w’ork.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Young people have a special reason to consider this now. If your life is to have meaning and purpose, you must set and strive for worthwhile goals in youth. How do you want to use your life? What career can you choose that will prove to be the most satisfying and produce lasting benefits? Might pioneering be the answer? Like many other young people who have taken up this activity, you may find that this career offers a joy and peace of mind that have eluded those pursuing goals based on material </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2) </span><span class="font3">we want to help people, we will equate our success, not with the number of placements, but with the extent to w'hich we are able to use the magazines to help people to learn something that can save their lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFECTIVE USE OF MAGAZINES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> With this in mind, how can magazines be used effectively? A primary objective when one is approaching another person should be to get a chance to talk to him. If he is willing to speak with us, likely we can help him. Many householders are reluctant to talk, usually because of apathy, prejudice or worldly ideas. If we can overcome these initial barriers and get a listening ear, even though momentarily, we may be able to say something that will touch the heart. Magazine activity can help us to do that.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Response to release of the new booklets was outstanding! Our report reflects that we put them to good use immediately, distributing 1,355,777 during January! Very fine indeed! This shows that we appreciate new instruments that will help us to teach the good news more effectively. More importantly, the zealous distribution confirms our genuine desire to assist other people to gain the marvelous blessings to which these booklets point in God’s Word. Many have already reported excellent results in starting new studies, which shows that we have been applying the suggestions given for their use. Let us continue to carry them regularly, being alert to any opportunity to start a study, enabling more sincere persons to learn about Jehovah’s purpose. fied men in congregations have heavy responsibility of being teachers. (1 Cor. 12:28; 1 Tim. 3:2; Jas. 3:1) But all Christians are to be teachers when making disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Developing ability to teach is a fine objective for each of us. (Heb. 5:12-6:2) Requires desire to teach and effort to learn what and how to teach. Are you applying yourself ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Become a Better Teacher of God’s Word. Audience participation; based on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book, chapter 5. Audience should review that. In teaching we can use fine material in publications. Do we learn their contents so we can employ their reasoning and key texts even when we do not have publications available? Two or three brothers come to platform, taking part of interested persons; ask chairman realistic questions (not trick ones) on subject—can paraphrase questions 7, 13, 20, 27. Phrase the questions in a way that a non-Witness would. Chairman invites audience to present texts and reasoning in answer, without opening </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To teach well we need to know what the Bible says and how we can reply when confronted with questions. Do we try to remember key texts and lines of reasoning? Urge placing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book in May after tract distribution. Use it as a tool in teaching others. Chairman might give </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font11"> presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Concluding Remarks. Reviewing plans for tract distribution (May 1-10), encourage all to share, including new ones. Cover territory thoroughly, starting with areas not covered with last tract. Continue distribution until supply is exhausted or territory is covered; adjacent congregations may be able to help. Short observations on tract’s contents. Comment on Question Box.

<p><span class="font3">Haven’t you found that to be so? Many have said that the booklets can be used quite effectively to stir interest where response in the past has been minimal. We are all happy to have these new instruments that help us to be more successful. May your blessings be many as you continue using these new booklets to make disciples.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Using Magazines &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The magazines contain a fresh slant on the news. Many articles deal with things people are talking about. There are illustrations that tell a story at a glance. There are items to spark the interest of even the nonreligious. Well-written articles present powerful arguments with the simplest of logic. Titles are purposely chosen to he thought provoking. If you can use anything in the magazines to elicit even a small response, you may create an opening that can lead to an extended witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Before sharing in the magazine activity, you may want to try this: (1) Look over the magazines, picking out a few eye-catching features that you feel are appealing. (2) Try to think of just one or two sentences you could say that would prompt some comment by the householder on one subject. (3) Put a mark in your Bible at a text dealing with the Kingdom message and that you feel you can tie in with that subject in some way. You may get a chance to read it if you get a favorable response.&quot; (4) Finally, look over the three new booklets we use to start studies. Note something you can refer to in a booklet if you get a listening ear. Now, you are better prepared, not just to place magazines and booklets, but to take the first step toward building faith in the heart of a new disciple.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>G</sup> As you go from door to door, keep in mind starting studies. Many persons will show minimal response, so presentation of the magazines may be the extent of your effort. But when someone shows any inclination to converse, be ready to say something to stimulate further interest. If interest is limited, perhaps you can leave a brief Scriptural thought, making a note on your House-to-House Record to call again with the next issues. When you find a willing listener, try to start a study using one of the booklets and make definite arrangements to call back soon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Magazine activity in this manner extends our objective beyond placements. The emphasis is on people and what we can do to help them. It would be a fine thing for the elders in each congregation to arrange for a magazine day each week, encouraging all to share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> It is our desire that sincere ones respond as those did long ago who came to learn of Jehovah’s marvelous acts: “Then they had faith in his word; they began to sing his praise.”—Ps. 106:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO ALL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Some brothers and sisters must realistically acknowledge that, as much as they want to do so, they are not in position to serve as regular pioneers. Still, appreciation gives them the same wholehearted spirit. For many of them, holidays, vacations or work layoffs become choice opportunities to serve as temporary pioneers. Some families pool resources, assisting one or more family members to pioneer. Others on occasion can add to their activity as congregation publishers, planning full days of service periodically. Maybe they can occasionally join a pioneer in service for a full day. Those pioneering often encourage others to become more active, while publishers can help the pioneers by providing transportation and someone with whom to work. When appreciation moves us to give our best, we usually discover a wide range of opportunities to increase our praise to God.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> There are many new ones attending meetings, and the good things they are learning, combined with the loving interest shown in their welfare, may have stirred feelings of gratitude in their hearts. Their newly acquired hope may be tract campaign. No doubt about it; the impact has been great!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> .No. 22 will be different. Yes, a different subject. But it will also have a different appearance. It will be the size of a four-page booklet. You will find it convenient to carry, to hand out and to slip under the doors. It will be necessary to separate and fold every other one before distribution. However, there will be no need to stamp them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> How can we prepare in advance to ensure the best results? New ones may find this to be a fine opportunity to share for the first time in house-to-house activity. Encouragement and assistance by experienced publishers will add measurably to their confidence. Parents may want to plan extra arrangements for family participation, especially for the younger ones. Book study conductors can discuss it with their groups, perhaps arranging additional meetings for service for those who are able to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font3">seeking expression in public declaration. (Rom. 10:10) The special activities connected with the Memorial observance, the distribution of special magazines, and the tract work in May, could provide opportunities for them to join the ranks of Kingdom praisers. Those of us who are close' to them can give encouragement and help. If they have the desire and qualify, by all means extend a warm invitation for them to join in expressing appreciation to God through the field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> All that is stated in the foregoing encourages us to think about doing more in Jehovah’s service. This is similar to Paul’s admonition that his brothers “keep on doing it more fully.” (1 Thess. 4:1) For what reason? Not to compile an impressive field service record. Neither is it for reasons of personal pride or comparison with others. It is because gratitude for Jehovah’s marvelous provisions causes our hearts to overflow with thankfulness. A desire to do more springs from a deep appreciation of all that he has given us and a genuine interest in helping others to receive these same blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Because they manifested their appreciation with zeal, Paul commended his brothers for ‘their faithful work and loving labor and their endurance due to hope.’ (1 Thess. 1:3) Can you see some way that you can more fully demonstrate your appreciation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Using Expiration Slips Effectively</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup>Our heartfelt desire is to help persons to learn the truth and become disciples of Jesus. Accordingly, we spend much time in the service looking for persons who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) An expiration slip is an excellent aid in finding and helping such persons. Why is that so?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Because an expiration slip can lead you to someone who has been regularly receiving publications that are of interest to individuals who may be inclined to become true Christians. But how will you use such a slip if you receive one from the Bible study overseer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The former subscriber may simply have forgotten to renew the subscription. Yet it is also possible that interest may have waned a bit or become crowded out by the cares of life. Hence, as a step toward making disciples, we should try to rekindle or increase that person’s interest in the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> When calling back with an expiration slip, many have found it helpful to mention right away something like, “I am connected with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> [or the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower} </span><span class="font3">magazine; from time to time we make brief visits on persons who have received and enjoyed this fine publication.” The householder thus can know that your visit is not unusual and that you are not there solely to renew the subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> After introducing yourself, how can you stimulate interest in the good news? It will help to have in mind an interesting subject found in one of the current magazines. You can bring up that topic and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">How Crime Will Be Stopped </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Conf d) </span><span class="font3">share during the week. Brothers assigned to care for territory should see that adequate territory is available, concentrating first on territory not covered in the last tract distribution. Elders may contact neighboring congregations about assistance in covering territory and making sure that tract supplies are distributed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In making your plans, keep uppermost in mind that the purpose behind this work is to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">help people. </span><span class="font3">We want to cover territory, but, more importantly, we want to help any who show interest. Where circumstances permit, try to speak personally to each householder. If offering the tract prompts a listen-perhaps tie in an appropriate text. Here is an example with the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of April 15: You could mention that, while human experts have often shed light on some fact, 2 Timothy 1:10 shows that Jesus is the one who has shed light on life itself; through him eternal life is possible. (Acts 4:12) Next, you might mention that the April 15 special issue deals with this matter; you are bringing it so the householder will not miss it, since his subscription has expired. Offer to provide free assistance in gaining the knowledge that can lead to eternal life, and explain that you will be happy to renew the subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Depending on the householder’s time, interest and how the discussion has been going, you may be able to demonstrate briefly the Bible study arrangement, using one of the new booklets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Underscoring the fact that expiration slips can be a real aid toward making disciples is the experience of one pioneer. On what he planned to be his last call for the day, he contacted a former subscriber at about 1 p.m. What happened? Listen: “That call stretched to 3 p.m. The woman we called on not only renewed her subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font3"> but also then subscribed for eighteen other persons —family members and friends.” And this brother feels that on his next visit he will be able to establish a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Yes, subscription expiration slips are a valuable aid toward finding interested persons and making disciples. If you have any expiration slips in your witnessing bag, use them during April in your disciple-making work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">ing ear, why not be ready -to point out a Bible text that ties in with the tract’s message? Psalm 37:10, 11 might be effective. You can also carry copies of the new booklets and the magazines. Be sure to take written note of any good response and call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The Society is very much interested in the results accomplished by tract distribution. We will be pleased to receive any outstanding experiences showing response in your territory. We can be confident of Jehovah’s blessing as we use this as still another means to keep “bringing good news of something better” to the attention of sincere people who are seeking hope for a happy future.—Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">C*There was a concerted effort to publicize the Malawi persecution. Newspapers, radio and TV stations were contacted. By February 1, over 1,000 newspaper stories about Malawi had appeared in the U.S.A., with over 12,000 column inches of space devoted to it. At least 430 radio stations covered the story. There have been about 100 radio and TV interviews. The response from the listening public has been outstanding. Many persons contacted the stations for more information as to what they could do to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Numerous individuals were moved to write to officials who they felt might be able to help. A Harvard University scientist wrote the World Council of Churches. Other persons wrote to various Presbyterian churches or church bodies. As a result, that Church's headquarters sent a letter to all Presbyterian pastors disclaiming any &quot;direct organizational relationship with the Church in Malawi.&quot; A U.S. Senator entered two long newspaper articles about the Malawi persecution in the U.S. Congressional Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Latest reports from Malawi indicate that the persecution continues.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Question (Sox</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">• Is it advisable for someone to hold a territory permanently?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For various reasons, individuals may find that covering a certain territory best suits their circumstances. For example, some who lack transportation find it convenient to have territory near home. Or, someone with physical limitations may prefer territory where there are few stairs to climb. It is good when territories can be made available to help such publishers to maintain a regular share in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yet, where practical, there are advantages when they turn in a territory assignment after covering it a few times. This allows others in similar circumstances to visit that territory. Also, it is often beneficial to have different publishers make calls in a territory, recognizing that people respond to various personalities. A publisher of a different age, with another approach, or who calls at a different time of day, may have greater success in reaching certain persons. Allowing a variety of publishers to cover a territory may result in w’hat we all desire—an effective witness to everyone. The field overseer can coordinate matters to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If someone feels that circumstances recommend his holding on to a certain territory assignment, then it may be that periodically others can be invited to share along with him in covering it. The book study conductor may be able to help by arranging occasional group witnessing. When others are able to develop interest or start studies, they may want to continue calling. Or such calls may be turned over if the publisher holding the territory assignment is in the best position to follow up the interest effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The determining factor is: What will be in the best interest of the people in the territory? We want to care for the territory in a way that will result in the greatest assistance for all sheeplike ones.</span></p>

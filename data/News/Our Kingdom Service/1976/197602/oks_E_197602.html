<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 1976</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 19, No. 2 FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Q)ea/i ^uWisfie/ts:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Here we are in 1976 just as eager to preach the good news as at any time before. We still have the assignment from Christ Jesus, “Go . . . make disciples of people of all the nations,” and this we are earnestly trying to do. As we know, the three new booklets are designed to aid in this. How many of them have you placed? Have they assisted you to start a new study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our brothers in Malawi and in Mozambique do not have all the printed aids that we do, but they continue to praise Jehovah. Even the vicious persecution that has come on them has resulted in the giving of a tremendous witness. (Phil. 1:12-14) We have at hand reports from all parts of the United States, besides Kenya, South Africa, Hong Kong, Malaysia, England, Canada and France, telling what is happening to our brothers in Malawi. Copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> report on Malawi were furnished to representatives to the United Nations, to all U.S. congressmen and senators. We know of over seventy radio stations that have carried the story. At least ten TV stations have featured it. Thus the world is hearing what is happening to Jehovah’s people because they uphold God’s kingdom. All of this contributes to the separating of people as foretold in Matthew 25:31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some time ago, you may recall, we announced the purchase of a large new printing press, but the manufacturers are slow in making delivery. They promised it for June, and then October and then December, and now for February. We hope it will be soon. But, regardless, we will use the equipment that we have and will gladly provide all the literature that you may need. Keep making good use of it in the field while there is still the freedom to do so. Remember, our brothers in Malawi cannot go from house to house, but we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brothers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Speaking the Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “As for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen ana heard.” With these courageous words the apostles Peter and John stated their position when before a court that demanded they quit talking about Jesus. Satan would like the telling of the good news to cease, but Christians have the obligation to keep speaking the word of God. This is why the apostles refused to stop. Earnestly they prayed: “Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.” Jehovah backed them up in this speaking.—Acts 4:20, 29, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> As the first-century Christians carried on their evangelizing work, they became skilled in speaking to others. Following the example of Jesus Christ, they conversed with people in public places as well as in their homes in order to spread the good news. (Acts chapters 3, 10, 17) Do you remember how Philip the evangelizer started a conversation with the Ethiopian eunuch by asking: “Do you actually know what you are reading?” (Acts 8:30) That led to the Ethiopian’s accepting Jesus as Messiah. What a marvelous work was accomplished through effective conversations!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15">WISH Y@M &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIME?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> It seems that everyone says that there is not enough time to get everything done. But is it not true that most people try to find time to do the things they really want to do? Do you wish you had more time for theocratic use? How can you find more opportunities for field service? We encourage you to examine your own activities to see what uses up your time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Most of us have to spend time in taking care of our families and supporting them. This puts us in contact with people of the world who may have lots of suggestions on how we can use our spare time. They may be sincere and friendly in offering social activities, but is it in these activities that we want to use our time? Paul counsels: “Go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside, buying out the opportune time for yourselves.” (Col. 4:5) When we have necessary contact with people of the world, are we taking advantage of appropriate opportunities to talk to them about the Kingdom message? By giving thought to it, perhaps you will find more opportunities to tell the good news, when it is appropriate, while engaging in your daily routine of work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Though they did not have books and magazines as we do now, with the help of Jehovah’s spirit the good news was spread to all parts of the Roman Empire. The early Christians knew the Holy Scriptures well. They referred to God’s Word and often quoted directly from it in talking with people about the truth. What a fine example they set!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVERSATIONS IDENTIFY US</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> How about us today? Both when in the field service and at other appropriate times, do we carry on effective conversations with people about the truth? Do some people tend to view us merely as literature distributors? We should be recognized as teachers, evangelizers, if we follow the lead of Jesus and the early disciples, should we not? We should be known as people with a message of hope and comfort, people who are ready to share information through interesting and effective conversation. Jehovah’s people in some lands have no publications they can place; but they do use the Bible and talk to others, often in public places. And the work grows.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps you want to find more time to be with your family and to do things with your children. Have you thought of making arrangements for the whole family to spend more time in the field service together? It is good for children to see their parents serving Jehovah and to listen to how they talk about the truth. Doing things together in this way helps to keep the family close together.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WORKING WITH GROUPS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Meetings for field service are very good, but they can also use up valuable time. It is helpful if the conductor prepares ahead of time and knows exactly what is to be done. Usually ten minutes spent in such a meeting is sufficient time. There can be a brief consideration of the text for the day, a few pointed suggestions on the current presentation, a word about where each publisher or group will work, and a prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes, when arriving in the territory, valuable minutes are lost in trying to decide who will work with whom, and where. If </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">16 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 4. Introduction. Comment on February theme, “Stay in the Way of Life with a Christian Conscience. (1 Pet. 3:16; see April 1, 1975, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.)</span><span class="font13"> Include reference to how proper understanding of God’s Word together with a good conscience will cause us to make wise decisions in life. Keeping our dedication close in mind will help us do God’s will. Good personal study habits will help us train conscience properly. Participating regularly in field service helps us keep good conscience and stay in way of life. —1 Tim. 1:5, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">“Wish You Had More Time?” Questions and answers. Include any appropriate local suggestions on how to make the most practical use of time in the field service or how to schedule and organize better. Offer to be of help to anyone who wishes to go over his schedule. Encourage using an hour or two more a month in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">19 min: </span><span class="font13">Analyzing Your Own Presentation. Talk showing it is good to sit down and analyze our presentation from time to time, on occasions doing so with others who have success in what they are doing. Do we get householder involved? One way is to put magazine or book in householder’s hands. When speaking about a feature of the publication, point it out. Makes impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Are you observant? Are there children in the home? Is there an ill person or invalid? Is there anything indicating the person’s religious belief? Learn to be flexible and tactful in presentation, taking advantage of what you see and trying to make your presentation meaningful. Select article or subject and scriptures that might have most appeal to person’s thinking. Preparation comes in here; know what is in the magazine. The more you know, the more you can say to convince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sometimes several people are listening. Do not ignore any. Try to cover interest of everyone. Let each one examine the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Demonstration: Two publishers in service together talk about how they will make presentation with first article in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> Come to house and speak to mother, two children present in background playing. Publisher sees children and so makes presentation with reference to first article in February 8 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> which involves children. After leaving house explains to other publisher that she had read the magazine and knew what to use if situation came up; therefore changed from planned presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Chairman encourages all to prepare well and thus enjoy service more. Suggest that some publishers or family groups may find it helpful to go over their presentations together before going out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding Comments. Suggest that during February we try to get subscriptions from workmates or schoolmates. Mention progress, number of new subscriptions since January 1 and new Bible studies started. Suggest bringing </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book next week. Song</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 92. Introduction and day’s text. Comment on congregation field report for January and Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Have You Called Back? Discuss use of House-to-House Record. Especially practical this winter. Want to make a return visit soon wherever booklets are placed. Every publisher should use Record or personal notebook, or calls will probably not be made. Value of making notes that will help you when you go back. Can use more than one line on House-to-House Record for each person. When making notations after first call ask yourself which subject would interest person most: write that down so you will not forget. Some publishers have noted that person was ill or had a problem, and then on follow-up call they opened up with query as to health, etc. This personal interest makes good impression and builds up friendly relationship. Good to be friendly and conversational when visiting again. Ask audience how many have gone back where booklets were placed, also what points they found effective in their territory. Ilow did they prepare before going? Better to have something definite to say, not just, “Did you read the booklet?” or, “How did you like it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Have brief refresher demonstration on starting a study with one of the booklets. Chairman follows with invitation to those who have not started study or have problem with this to speak with him or Bible study overseer following meeting for suggestions on making arrangements to go with someone to gain experience. Encourage all to carry House-to-House Record and use it regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font13">“Presenting the Good News —Another Way.” Discuss article and follow with demonstration showing publishers selecting key texts from chapter of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book and noting them on slip of paper to put in Bible. Two publishers should talk to each other, selecting key texts, so audience can follow along in book and see why they chose those texts for making presentation. Then follow up with demonstration of two going to a home and using it to consider theme. Chairman encourages all to try selecting texts on a chapter theme during coming week and then to try to speak to someone on subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding Comments. Mention advisability of carrying additional publications when doing magazine work. If working with car, good to have extra copy of Bible and a few books in car in case interested person requests them. Mention which issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> to be used next week in meeting. Song 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Communicate Through Effective Conversation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 11. Introduction. Show need to communicate with others through effective conversation. Use first two paragraphs of “Keep Speaking the Word.” In Bible times conversation, talking to people, was chief means of spreading good news. Marketplaces were often used as places to exchange information and news through conversation. (Acts 17:16, 17) Jesus and early Christians also conversed with people in their homes in order to spread good news.—Luke 19:5, 6; Acts 20:20, 27; Matt. 10:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font13">“Keep Speaking the Word.” Start with paragraph 3. Questions and answers. Ask brothers who have had success locally what questions or points they use to arouse interest and to get conversation going, reasoning with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Demonstration: Publisher presents magazines, but with no theme or attempt at conversation. Householder refuses. How could he improve? Chairman highlights need to get conversation going, get householder involved. Follow up with another demonstration showing publisher starting conversation with person who refused literature: sees what is on mind of householder, then leaves person with good things to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Chairman concludes, encouraging all to make effort to open conversation about Bible truth with someone sometime during every day and build up ability to express self on truth. Also, if persons have literature already, it may be practical to offer to consider what they have or even to start a study by making conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Review latest </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">magazine. Often been encouraged to know what is in the magazines, read them first. Then have good points to use in conversing at doors. Read an article and talk about it with someone at home or a brother or even a stranger. Do you have main points still in mind after reading? Can you tell someone what you read? If necessary, you could even put magazine down and talk to self about article in practice session. Chairman should have some publishers well prepared to comment on articles they have read (without magazine or notes in hand), but let all audience share in program at this point. In articles highlight main points needed to carry on coherent conversation on subject. Encourage all publishers to try to do this wuth an article in next magazine they receive in mail, and after practicing use information in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding Comments. Include accounts report. Remind brothers to prepare for next week’s consideration of February 15 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> bringing copy next week. Song 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 23. Introduction. Comments on Theocratic News, appropriate Announcements and Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font13">“God Wants People to Live.” Article from February 15 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font13">Make up questions for each paragraph. Appropriate texts can be looked up in Bibles and some paragraphs in magazine read in summary. After finishing article ask for expressions from audience on what this material means to them personally or how it helped them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Our Field Service. Experiences on subscription campaign to date, as well as starting studies in the booklets. Comments may be made on contents of latest magazines for use in field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding Comments. Hearing from any who might have expression on success in using suggestions to start conversations with people during last week. Song 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The theme of the first article in each issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and the scripture prominently featured therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Speaking the Word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> While many publishers are adept at starting conversations on Bible topics, others would appreciate suggestions as to how they can improve their ability. Practice and experience are needed in order to be really effective, but a few suggestions here might prove helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> First, we should be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">genuinely interested</span><span class="font2"> in people and their welfare. That is why we spread the good news, is it not? We want to help others to learn the truth so they can worship Jehovah and enjoy the blessed promises found in his Word. (Rom. 10:13-15) Do your attitude, your tone of voice, your facial expressions and words reflect genuine friendliness and interest in the householder? This is a key to effective conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Also, it helps to take into account the customs of the people, or things that are of special interest to the local populace. Then, like Paul, you can tactfully include these in your conversation. (Acts 17:22, 23, 28) Take note of local happenings that are reported in the newspaper or on the radio. Current news items are effective in starting conversations, because these are on the minds of people and they may have a reaction that they will freely express. It also helps if we learn how to ask viewpoint questions in a tactful way to determine the person’s thoughts or interests, but being careful not to ask embarrassing questions. Once the conversation gets started, of course, it is not hard to work in the good news. Always keep in mind your objective so that the discussion will lead into a witness about the Kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS CAN START CONVERSATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> What kind of questions might we use to open up a conversation? Consideration must be given to the type of person and the area in which we work. Questions that have been used successfully in the field by some are:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Do you believe that a book written by man could, nevertheless, be God’s message to mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What do you think about the origin of our life? Is it from a source higher than man, and from one to whom we are responsible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What do you think is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">greatest problem</span><span class="font2"> facing mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you think that it is possible for us to enjoy the best from life today and to have a secure hope for the future without an accurate knowledge of our Maker (or life source) ?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font13">Literature offer, February through April: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50, or subscriptions for both magazines, with six booklets, for $3.00. If subscription offer is not accepted, we can offer two magazines and the three new booklets for 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font13">On Saturday, April 17, the Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms will be closed for spring cleaning; so there will be no arrangement for tours on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font13">In the June </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font13">announcement was made concerning new identification cards to be issued to all baptized publishers and it was requested that old cards be destroyed. Some congregations have not followed through on this yet, so this reminder is given to the elders. Publishers should not be carrying the old identification cards. The new identification cards are available at two for one cent. If your congregation has not yet ordered them, please do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font13">Recently a number of reports have been received from congregations in this country about persons who have come to the congregation and asked for money, but later proved to be impostors. It seems good to mention this now and to warn the brothers to be on</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you believe that religion serves as a real force for righteousness in the lives of people today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you see any connection between the tremendous loss of morality in society today and the teaching of evolution in the schools and colleges?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> These questions may prove to be effective for you. On the other hand, you may find that other questions or remarks appeal to people in your area. Use whatever brings results in getting a conversation started. In addition to selecting a question, however, be sure to have in mind a few interesting facts on the subject as well as two or three related scriptures. This is necessary in order to keep your discussion going. You can get texts on many themes from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Make Sure.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Remember, conversation is a ‘two-way street.’ We really must be good listeners also. If we ask for a householder’s viewpoint, then we really are obligated to listen to his viewpoint, are we not? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">If we listen, </span><span class="font2">then we know more about what he thinks and can use this as a basis for appealing to the householder. We are thus in a good position to share thoughts from God’s Word in a way that will interest the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> What should we do if the householder recognizes us as one of Jehovah’s witnesses and immediately says that he does not want any literature? Perhaps the householder thinks that our only goal is to leave magazines or books with people. Tactfully try to start an interesting conversation and thus plant some seeds of truth. Try to give the </span><span class="font13">the watch for such persons. If someone comes and says he is in need, it is wise to ascertain the location of the congregation from which he came and inquire of an elder there to see if the person is telling the truth; also get a recommendation from the former congregation before giving money to such a stranger.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> Try it. Start right away to strike up conversations with people that you meet in the house-to-house work and in other places. Giving people some encouraging words to think about will bring you encouragement also. At the end of each day when you think over what you have done, if you have told the good news to someone during that day, you will have a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure.—Col. 1:5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How marvelous it was to see 577,362 sharing in Kingdom service and the disciple-making work during November! We exceeded the previous peak in publishers, May 1975, by 16,465! Y<sup>r</sup>es, honest-hearted ones continue responding to the good news of the Kingdom, and what a pleasure it is to help them. In all, we have now had six </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font13"> distribution campaigns, and during each of these months new peaks in publishers were reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Another wholesome development was that publishers averaged 10.4 hours during November, a nice increase from the 9.2 hour average of October. The more time we spend in field sendee, the more people have opportunity to hear the truth. As all of us utilize every opportunity to start Bible studies with the use of the three new booklets, surely more people will be attracted to the truth and the Christian way of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Way</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> In order to carry out our commission to make disciples, we endeavor to start home Bible studies with those who show interest. The Bible study work has been effective in assisting many thousands to become true disciples of Jesus Christ. However, what might we do where someone displays some interest in the Bible and yet shows resistance to becoming involved in a formal study of some publication?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Here is where the Christian teacher can learn to be flexible, adaptable, ready to cover the study material in another way. The apostle Paul was successful in being flexible, and he recommends his example to us.—1 Cor. 9:19-23; 11:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> When someone is willing to discuss </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font2"> the Bible, but not with the aid of another book, some publishers have found it very effective to go along with the wishes of such a person, and they convey the good news successfully. One way </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wish You Had More Time? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font2">traveling is involved, why not make all these arrangements while on the way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> If you work scattered territories, do you have several people sitting in the car waiting for one or two? In many cases publishers can be dropped off by the driver and then picked up a little later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Winter presents problems, and weather may at times disrupt plans for field service. What can be done? If we get snowed in, would it not be good to use the time we had set aside for field service to speak to someone on the telephone or to write some letters to stir up interest in the truth? This is making good use of the time. Health problems, too, may interfere with our getting out, but, again, we may be able to write to people or mail out some literature and thus not lose out altogether on having a share in the service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>s</sup> There is a limit as to how much time we have for preaching the good news, so we like to get the most out of the time we can serve. For example, if, when we are out in the field service, we notice that there are many not-at-homes, is there another time when we could go out, when we might find more people, perhaps in the late afternoons or in the evenings? If we find that we are doing our magazine work on the streets when few people are there, could we accomplish of doing this is to jot down on notepaper that will fit into your Bible six to eight key scriptures from a chapter of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font2"> book. Most of us are very familiar with this publication. We know the Scripture texts and understand them well. So if we use the key scriptures from one of the chapters and have the context well in mind, we can carry on a lively conversation with the interested person based on these key Bible texts. We ought to endeavor to guide the conversation, keeping it progressive and on the main points brought out in the Scripture references, while at the same time allowing the other person to express himself. In handling the call in this way we will really be covering information brought out in the book, theme by theme, but the householder will not feel tied to a formal study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> If you are experiencing difficulties with starting studies in your territory you may wish to try this way of teaching where someone is willing to have a discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">more, contacting many more people, by working in another place? Also, do we approach people and speak to them? These are a few of the things to consider when we ask ourselves whether we are just counting time or really making our time count.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> The body of elders may wish to discuss how the schedule of meetings affects the congregation’s field service. When do most publishers go in the field service? Do publishers get into the service on Sundays? Some congregations may find that an adjustment of times of meetings will allow for more field service and still be convenient for the majority of the congregation. —See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization,</span><span class="font2"> page 103.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Organized people get the most out of the time they have available. Preparation is vital. Each one of us should have a schedule. We do well to ask ourselves: ‘What do I really want to do? Do I want to serve Jehovah? If so, what is a good goal as to field service to set for myself? Can I try for a full day instead of just an hour?’ Talk it over in the family. If we make an examination with these things in mind, we may find that, indeed, we do have more time for field service than we had thought. How wonderful it would be if, by doing this, each one of us could find another hour or two a month to add to the public praise that we give to Jehovah.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">sembly hall with a capacity of 1,300 was dedicated in Madrid, Spain, for use by the 85 congregations in the Madrid area. Brother F. W. Franz was invited to participate, and he commented that when he first went to Spain in 1947 there was only a handful of publishers in Madrid. Now 5,691 attended the special dedication program of the first assembly hall in Spain. The Spanish branch reports a new peak of 32,184 publishers.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>(Question (Sox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">• Is it proper for one of Jehovah’s witnesses to receive treatment and care at a hospital operated by a religious organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Various religious organizations operate hospitals, which provide medical treatment and care. Generally such hospitals are not established for the outright promotion of false religion. They may have been incorporated originally to serve a religious organization as a source of income. Today, however, some hospitals are religious in their name only, whereas others are still partially staffed by members of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If one of Jehovah’s witnesses requires hospital care, he must make his own decision as to whether he will go to a hospital that may possibly be connected with a religious organization. The conscience of one might permit him to do so, but the conscience of another may prevent him from doing so. There are certain circumstances that may have a bearing on one’s decision and it is good to consider these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For example, a hospital with a religious name may be the only one in the immediate area. Or, if there is another hospital nearby, the one with possible religious connections may have a reputation for superior service. Also, such a hospital with a religious name may be the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font13"> one equipped to provide the particular treatment needed, or it may be the only hospital where your doctor or surgeon is able to handle cases. Also, sometimes hospitals with religious connections may respect your viewpoint as a Christian on the use of blood, whereas some other private or municipal hospitals may not. So these are some factors that you may have to consider when deciding what hospital to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you do decide to use a hospital with religious connections, you might view it merely as paying for services rendered. You might view it as if the religious organization were operating a certain business, and in purchasing a service from such business you would not be making a direct, voluntary contribution to the support of a false religion. You would merely be paying for a product or a service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of course, as a Christian, in such circumstances you must definitely see to it that you do not engage in any acts of false worship. Also, you could not ascribe the usual religious titles, like “Father” or “Sister,” to individuals who may work at or visit the hospital. You would have to see to it that the matter is strictly a business arrangement in which you are receiving treatment and service, and nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So, each one will have to consider all the circumstances involved and then make his own decision as to which hospital he will use.—Gal. 6:5.</span></p>

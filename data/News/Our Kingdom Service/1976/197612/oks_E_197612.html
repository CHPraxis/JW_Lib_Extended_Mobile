<p><span class="font1">DECEMBER 1976</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Vo!. 19, No. 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Q)ecu ^ingdotn ^Pubfcstes;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">We are now in position to review with you what has been accomplished during the 1976 service year. A vast amount of work was done in preaching the good news of the Kingdom for a witness and in aiding persons to know the way that leads to life. And more have been sharing in the preaching work, as there was a 2-percent increase in the U.S.A, on the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The analysis shows that there have been decreases in most averages—hours, magazines, return visits and Bible studies. While this is of much concern to us, and we all look for ways to do better in Jehovah’s service, there is reason to be encouraged regarding our future activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The congregations in the United States have now increased to 7,375, and there are 334 circuits and 35 districts. The publisher-to-population ratio is now a favorable 1 to 370. Many congregations are covering their assigned territory frequently, and during 1978, as was the case every year since 1970, all the unassigned territory was covered. So Jehovah is blessing the efforts of his people to widen out the proclamation of the good news even deep into this time of the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The monthly average of 17,251 regular pioneers was down from 20,385 last year. But we feel sure that many are now planning to take up pioneer privileges in the present service year or to enter the auxiliary pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since our hours have decreased on the average from 9.6 in 1975 to 9.1 (or close to 8 million fewer hours), this is a good time to think about ways we can personally reverse this trend. Our each spending just one additional hour in Jehovah’s service each month would put the average over 10 again, and think of what praise to Jehovah could be accomplished by all of us together putting in this addi-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">The Bible's Message in Reach of Everyone</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As we would reasonably expect in the case of an inspired guide provided by the Creator for people of all races, the Bible has been widely distributed. It is available, the whole or in part, in languages spoken by 97 percent of the world’s population. Modem printing has made it possible for millions and millions of copies to be distributed each year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One of the reasons for the Bible’s popularity is that it touches the heart of the reader today just as it has done all through the centuries, because it deals with human problems. It makes no difference what kind of society—farming, seafaring, or industrial—all persons can grasp its message. Human nature has not changed, and the Bible deals with real problems that affect humans wherever and whenever they live.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Have you sat down and just read the Bible itself for an hour or two—for example, the Gospel accounts, the book of Acts or the books of Samuel or of Kings? When you do, note how you begin to feel that you are living at that time. Your heart is touched. Such reading is a spiritually uplifting experience.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">LET THE BIBLE SPEAK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When we go to the people, it is our aim to get them to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">read </span><span class="font11">the Bible. Most people never read it. That is why there is so much</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Help to Improve Your Teaching</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do you find that you need a helping hand to improve in presenting the good news? Assistance is available right in your congregation. Do not be hesitant to seek this assistance from more experienced publishers. There are many things that can be learned from preparing together and then working together, even if you merely observe for a few calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps your experience in the field service has been limited up to this point to distributing tracts or sharing in the magazine distribution. Commendably you are arranging to have some share in telling others of Jehovah’s means of salvation. Would you like to take another important step now in making your preaching and teaching work more effective and productive? Remember, the commission that Jesus gave to his disciples included the ‘making of disciples of people of all the nalack of faith, with increased trouble and sorrow.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In December we will be presenting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> But our first objective is to talk about the Bible, to get people to see its value and their need for its wisdom. How can we better help them, or encourage them to read the Bible, and show them something it contains?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> To get the conversation started, you might first ask them if they have a Bible. You may find that many already do have one. In this case, ask them if they find time in this busy world to read it. Do they have any problem in understanding it? Often this will give you the opportunity to go farther and help them to get right into the Bible. You might even ask that they get their own copy so that they can read from it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> For example, reference might be made to Psalm 37:37, 38, in showing what is ahead for those who are upright in God’s sight in comparison with the outcome for the wicked. The Bible shows that God will soon clear away wickedness and wicked people, and then those who love God and their neighbors will be able to live in peace and happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Then you might tell them of the special Bible study arrangement Jehovah’s Witnesses are in-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">tions, baptizing them.’ (Matt. 28: 19, 20) The command given later at Revelation 22:17 was that “anyone hearing” the good news should say: ‘Come and take of life’s water free.’ The making of disciples requires that we be teachers, and to this end we invite you to take this next step toward disciple-making by engaging in the return visit and home Bible study work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE TO GET HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Speak to your book study conductor or any one of the elders and tell him that you would like this help to improve your teaching. Very likely he will be able to arrange for one of the experienced publishers in your congregation who has a service schedule similar to yours to work with you for a few weeks. You may wish first to gain some experience in house-to-house work, using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>

How did David show the proper attitude after Nathan confronted him with his sins? How should we react if counsel is given but we have broken no law? How might this be illustrated? What factors involving the counselor might cause resentment when counsel is given? Why is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">pride </span><span class="font10">the root cause? Why is an attitude of being “always right” a dangerous one? What harm is done when counsel is rejected? What fine benefits come to one who accepts counsel? (Remind all to study the article “Why a God of Love Gives Reproof” in the December 1, 1976, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> and to bring this issue to the service meeting next week.)</span></p>

With everything planned in advance, such as territory to be worked and brothers to take the lead, should be fine day in Jehovah’s service. Discuss with audience what might be said appropriately in introducing the offer on this holiday. What might be said if person wishes publisher “Merry Christmas”? Without making an issue of this, publisher might say in return: “Thank you”; “And I wish you a good day”; or something similar. Sample presentation might be featured. (It is suggested that these points be reviewed at the meetings for service this week.) Song 107.</span></p>

Paragraphs 4, 5: Why should we be grateful for divine correction? Paragraphs 6-8: In what ways should love and patience be reflected in the disciplining of children by parents?

Paragraphs 16, 17: What should motivate a Christian elder in giving reproof, and w’hat is the Scriptural way to deal w’ith an erring one? Paragraph 18: How can reluctance to talk be dealt with, and what is it important to keep in mind even though strong measures must be taken? Referring to closing paragraph, briefly mention what questions will be taken up in future </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> studies as the subsequent articles are discussed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">® The Memorial for 1977 will be held on Sunday, April 3, after sundown. Where more than one congregation uses the Kingdom Hall, it will be permissible, if necessary, to start the first talk before sundown, but the serving of the emblems should always be after sundown. The following may help in determining this time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">local</span><span class="font10"> sunset time will be about a minute different from what it was for April 3, 1976.

<p><span class="font11">More and more reports are received from the field telling that many people are not at home when publishers call. Even when people are not at home, it takes time and energy to go from door to door. When we do not find people at home we might feel that we have not really accomplished much, but if we could leave a message that would aid them to learn about the truth, that would give us greater satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a pleasure to inform you that a small slip has been prepared entitled “You Had a Visitor.” This slip is about the size of a handbill and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should be folded before it is left under a door.</span><span class="font11"> The message it contains should stimulate the thinking of those who find it when they return home.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Again, let it be apparent that you are there to help the person appreciate God’s Word. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book is an aid to help in understanding the Bible. In it we learn of God’s new system where war, hunger, sickness and even death will be eliminated. You might refer to the happy scene on page 4 and ask the one with whom you are speaking if he or she would like to pick up a newspaper and read one of the headlines mentioned in paragraph 3 of page 5. Who would not like to read, “No Housing Shortage—Secure Jobs for Everyone” or “Disease and Old Age Eliminated—Hospitals and Funeral Parlors Closed Down”? Does that sound like a dream? No, it will be a reality, you can point out, because God has promised it. And this purpose of God and other vital subjects are discussed fully in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> If the person is listening well, you might briefly point out how the book is arranged to help people understand the Bible, and then demonstrate this with several paragraphs. Show them how the Bible is referred to repeatedly as proof of the things written. (Note, too, that often scriptures are cited at the end of a question at the bottom of the page. It is recommended that these be read in addition to those in the paragraphs above.) Cover a few paragraphs, such as those on page 5, and suggest returning at a convenient time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> If the one with whom you are speaking does not have a Bible, this is added reason for him to obtain a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> Discussing a few of its features may be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> How grateful we are that Jehovah is seeing to it that the Bible’s vital message is in reach of all who are searching for the truth and the way of life! His patience has permitted our learning of the way of salvation. Let us do our part as message bearers in spreading the good news of his Word to still others while there is still time.</span></p>

This will lay the foundation for some return visits with the objective of starting a Bible study. Or, the one working with you may already have some calls and would be happy to take you along when making them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Of course, before going into the field service it is advisable to prepare something to say that is pointed and interest-catching. This | will also help you in gaining confidence, if you are a little unsure I of yourself. There is no reason to be afraid or to hold back because you feel that you need more knowledge or experience. Going right I ahead while putting your confidence and trust in Jehovah will bring you many blessings. Soon it may be your privilege to conduct a Bible study regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Parents, have you recently analyzed what the next step might be for your children in progressively working toward the goal of being disciple-makers? If they are now sharing in tract work or magazine service, would their age and ability make it possible for you to assist them to progress further and use the Bible in their presentations? With your help, could they share in developing the interest they locate in their preaching work? Could a Bible study be started? Many young servants of Jehovah effectively share in conducting studies, especially among young folks of their age.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> At their quarterly meeting to be held in December, elders are invited to review how they can make loving assistance available to those who need it. This would be a good time also to review what has been done to implement the suggestions on page 7 of the March 1976 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font11"> to improve arrangements for giving assistance at the book studies under the supervision of the book study conductor. In giving assistance, build in the hearts of the brothers and sisters a desire to share in Jehovah’s service so that they get joy from it and want to do it regularly.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">—-With the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and “Good News” Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> December will be the first time that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book will be specially featured for the benefit of the public. It is a fitting companion to offer with the Bible, because it deals with the Bible’s inspiration, what the Bible contains, how it was preserved, and its value. Remember that the full title of the book is “Good News—to Make You Happy.” Happiness can be stressed, for people find it hard to be happy today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In the presentation, try to get into a discussion of the Bible first, if possible. You may wish then to feature the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font11"> or in certain cases circumstances may indicate that it would be preferable to offer the book first.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During the holiday season, Luke 2:8-11 or just Luke 2:13 and 14 will often awaken a hearing ear. Then the note from “The Publishers” on page 2 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book may be read, leading into chapter 1, page 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If, after the Bible discussion, you lead into the book, there are many good points to use. We will here suggest some transitions from the Bible discussion to the book, and some features that you may find to be appealing to many people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You might say, ‘Have you wondered how a book written by men could really be a pure message from God?’ Then point to the illustrations on pages 16 and 17, showing the different ways that God used to see that what he wanted in his Word was written down, and how he did oversee its accuracy. You might add that it is certainly heartwarming and meaningful for us to read the writings and follow the lives of men who served God, persons who had the same feelings and often the same problems that we have. To see how men of faith stood firm for God and to see how God dealt justly and mercifully with people means much to us; examples are often better than mere words. We can place ourselves in their posi-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Suggested Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discussion of one or more verses from Psalm 37:37, 38 or use of one or more verses from Luke 2:8-14: tion. How much better than a book of cold facts and commands, and just as authentic!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Other features that we could well use are one or more of the historical charts on pages 12, 21 and 26, because many people are confused as to the age of the Bible, and as to when certain Bible personalities lived—before or after the Flood, before or after Christ, and so forth. It helps much in Bible reading to know these things. We also have the chart of prophecies fulfilled in Christ (page 145), a study of which strengthens faith in the Bible’s authenticity and in Jesus’ Messiahship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> In our opening Bible discussion we may have spoken about God’s kindness, his mercy, his justice. In certain localities where people may be turned away from faith in God because of the hypocrisy they have observed in the false religious systems, we may be able to use the pictures on pages 104 and 105 to show that the clergy of Christendom misrepresent God and the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Of course, the theme of happiness is usually a welcome one. If there are children in the home, leafing through chapter 19 will be appealing. If you start a conversation by the use of Revelation 21:3, 4, chapter 17 of the book, particularly pages 158 and 159, should bring good cheer to the householder. The security mentioned on pages 5 and 6 will also, no doubt, appeal to some persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> If you cannot succeed at first in getting into the Bible, you may accomplish your purpose by using the scriptures from the “Sermon on the Mount,” page 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book, when placed in the hands of people, is a good instrument for a Bible study. It should be helpful in bringing many persons to a knowledge of the truth, and may reach some who were not reached with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. Those who already have the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book will appreciate reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> book also.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">• Should each Kingdom Hall display the yeartext?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is recommended that the yeartext be displayed in the Kingdom Hall in countries where this can be done without difficulties resulting. The yeartext is selected each year to provide timely encouragement for Jehovah’s people from the Scriptures. And when newly interested people visit us at the Kingdom Hall they are usually impressed when they see a verse or two from God’s Word featured as a reminder. From time to time in meetings, specific reference can be made to the yeartext, especially when parts on the meetings are related to this theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Often it is best to display the year-text at the front or side of the’ hall so it can be seen easily. If meetings in another language are held in the same hall, a yeartext in this language also could be featured. The size of the letters and the makeup of the sign itself should be appropriate and tasteful. Obviously one that is gaudy, with letters uneven or one that does not fit in with the decor, would not be appropriate. When it is time to design the yeartext, there may be someone in the congregation who has some decorating ability who might provide some suggestions on design and makeup. When the Kingdom Hall is in a home or a rented hall used by other groups, the elders can decide if it is practical to have a yeartext sign. If so, it may be necessary to construct it in such a way that it can be put up and taken down easily for each meeting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year, 43,900 persons were baptized in the U.S.A. We rejoice with these new servants of Jehovah in their stand for true worship and look forward to aiding them to press on to Christian maturity. Since Jehovah continues to show patience, let us imitate him and keep busy extending knowledge of the way of salvation to all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a pleasure to be working with you in holding high Jehovah’s great name in these momentous last days.</span></p>

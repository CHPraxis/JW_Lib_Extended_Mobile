<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On Sunday, April 19, 1981, after sundown, we will be gathered at our meeting places to commemorate the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. (1 Cor. 11:24, 25) What a heartwarming occasion this proves to be each year! We are grateful to have our mind and heart refreshed about the significance of what he did in our behalf. We are pleased when many interested ones assemble with us. But a large attendance is not our main concern. Rather, we want these interested persons to attend because the information presented about the ransom can reach their heart, moving them to share in pure worship. —Rev. 7:14, 15.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We personally want to remember God’s beloved Son by imitating his compassion for those not “related to us in the faith” and invite them to meet with us. (Gal. 6:10) Today, as never before, they are truly “sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) How good to have the fine information provided in the April 1, 1981, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In Bible times an invitation to sit at the table of a king to dine on food prepared and served by his royal servants was a great honor, an expression of the king’s “loving-kindness.” (2 Sam. 9:7-13; 1 Kings 2:7) Today, do we not feel deeply grateful for what the Great King, Jehovah, has done on our behalf? Through his Son, Jesus Christ, he has arranged a bounteous table and has given all of his people a standing invitation to enjoy the best in wholesome, healthful spiritual food. The Master, Jesus Christ, has appointed a “faithful and discreet slave” to serve “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45-47) What has been the principal means through which the anointed “slave” class has distributed the “food”? Clearly, for over 100 years it has been </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DO YOU VIEW “THE WATCHTOWER”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Knowing that the “slave” class is Christ’s instrument for dealing with the congregation today should make our heart very receptive to what </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> says. Also, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to bring to them. The timely article entitled “Celebrating the Death of the Greatest Man Ever on Earth” should be an excellent means to stir interest in this observance. It has a fresh approach to the subject and this should make our invitations more appealing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Be sure to use the special Memorial invitation printed for the occasion. This invitation has helped interested ones to appreciate the importance of the Memorial and the benefit of attending. It would be good to extend one to every person we have record of showing interest.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> All newly interested persons attending the Memorial should be presented with a copy of the March 15, 1981, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> It features the subject “Glorifying the Ministry” as the first study article scheduled for April 19.

The need to preach the established Kingdom, the clear distinction between Jehovah’s organization and Satan’s, the hope of eternal life on a paradise earth—all have been discussed Scripturally in their proper time. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">from its first issue, has always built up appreciation for the value of Jesus Christ’s ransom sacrifice and this continues to motivate us in our service.</span></p></li>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>(Question.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">• When can a Bible student and others be Invited to share In field service and thereafter be counted as a publisher? •</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Certainly there is good reason to rejoice when a new one wishes to join us in our public evangelizing work. At the same time, we recognize the need of safeguarding the name of Jehovah and the congregation from any reproach. This calls for discernment on the part of both the elders and the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Generally speaking, the publisher conducting the weekly Bible study Is in a good position to evaluate the new one’s spiritual progress. By listening to his speech and observing his conduct from week to week, a discerning teacher can see if the student has allowed God’s Word to take root in his heart, causing him to bring his life into harmony with Jehovah’s righteous standards.—Jas. 1:21; 1 Tfiess. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Before inviting a new one to join us in public preaching, however, it is good to review the questions listed on page 129, paragraph one, of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book. If you, the teacher, can answer in the affirmative the eleven questions presented there, then doubtless your Bible student can also do so and is ready to take part with you in the work. If, though, you are unsure about something, then on an appropriate occasion you can review selected scriptures, inviting the student’s expressions to make sure he understands the Importance of observing all the Scriptural requirements, including refraining from the use of tobacco. (Matt. 28:20) Of course, if you feel the need for advice, talk to an elder, possibly your book study conductor. It may be that he will talk to the new one if this appears advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When a new one turns in his first field service report, the congregation secretary should take note of this and Inform the service overseer. At his earliest convenience, the service overseer will want to discuss the new one’s qualifications with the brother or sister conducting the Bible study. Thereafter, he will arrange to talk personally with the new one to get better acquainted and to discuss the responsibilities and joys connected with bearing public witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Finally, after conferring with the presiding overseer, the service overseer may ask the secretary to make out a Publisher's Record Card for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, ool.</span><span class="font11"> 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">is scheduled for study on April 26, the week following the Memorial. The purpose is to whet the appetite of the interested persons to come to the April 26 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study. Extend a warm, friendly invitation to all to attend. For the benefit of new ones who have not yet had an opportunity to attend a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study, we suggest that you give them an idea of how the study is conducted, using the questions at the bottom of the page. It may even be possible for you to do this that same night following the Memorial celebration, or sometime before the day of the study. You may even be able to prepare with them part of the assigned material, thus making it easier for the individuals to follow the study procedure during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’Why not also encourage these new ones to attend the public talks regularly. If there is a list of upcoming talks on the information board, point out some of the subjects that will be discussed. Mention the fact that 60 new talks will be given during the next 12 months or so, some having started already in March. Let them know that you plan to hear these talks that will be presented on important Bible topics. They are welcome to attend whenever possible. You may wish to share a few points from talks already given, explaining how these have enlightened and strengthened you. Only a few new talks have been given thus far, so most of this fresh material is yet to come in the weeks ahead. Encourage them to benefit from such meetings even as you regularly do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REMIND OF RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Too, the significance of the Memorial occasion may prompt us to discuss the meaning of Christian discipleship with those studying, helping them appreciate how the truths they learn should be affecting their lives and activity. If their heart responds, then it may be an appropriate time to invite them to join in making a public declaration with their mouth for salvation. (Rom. 10:9, 10) We can help them realize that the time left for doing this is growing steadily shorter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The Memorial celebration is a special night when we are reminded of what Jehovah has done for us through his Son’s sacrifice. By attending, our determination to follow Christ’s self-sacrificing example is renewed. We rejoice that Christ Jesus is actively guiding and directing us in our modern-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You a Subscriber?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Why do you recommend that householders subscribe to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font12"> Is it not because you know that by their doing so they are availing themselves of an abundant and continuous supply of spiritually upbuilding information? Receiving the magazines at home regularly will maximize the opportunity for them to be motivated favorably toward the truth. Would this not also be true for ourselves? So, are you and every member of your family subscribers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Think of the benefits. For one thing, subscription copies of the magazine arrive weeks before the issue date. This allows ample time for reading and personal and family study before the congregational study. Due to sickness or other reasons, or simply through being forgetful, we may miss out on picking up the magazines at the Kingdom Hall. With the magazines coming to us regularly in the mail, we are assured of getting every issue, thus building up a complete</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">ruption with each passing decade, Jehovah has protected us with timely warnings against sexual immorality, drugs, and so forth, and set out procedures for disfellow-shiping unrepentant wrongdoers to safeguard the congregation. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> has helped us to train our conscience in ever so many areas of life so we can enjoy a good relationship with Jehovah. We appreciate so much Jehovah’s patient, progressive leading of us. —Prov. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO BENEFIT FULLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Considering </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">together as a congregation certainly contributes to our unity of thinking and builds in us a solid, Bible-based faith. (1 Cor. 1:10) But how can we individually contribute to making each </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study the spiritual highlight of the week, both for ourselves and our brothers? Three things are necessary to fully benefit from tbe </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study: (1) Personal and family preparation. Do you have time set aside for this? What works best for your family? During such study, do you pay particular attention to the scriptures, noting how they are used or applied? Why would this be good? (2 Tim.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">day disciple-making work. May the time and eSort that we devote in sacred service this month reflect our heartfelt remembrance of him. Thus we will move ahead unitedly in teaching others to have this same appreciation.—Matt. 28:19, 20. file for future use in connection with the Theocratic School and service meeting, as well as for research. In many families, the children are very much encouraged when the magazines come to them in their own name. This helps them to take greater interest in the magazines and receive greater benefits therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ This month we will be offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription once again. It would be appropriate to start with ourselves and our household becoming subscribers. Then, we might think about those among our friends, relatives, acquaintances, workmates, schoolmates, and so forth, who may enjoy receiving a gift subscription. Of course, the house-to-house work is still the principal way in which we may obtain subscriptions. Yes, by looking out for all the opportunities, we will have another rewarding month of activity with the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2:15) (2) Attend regularly. Are there some of us who habitually leave after the public talk? (3) Participate freely. We should not feel that a long, involved comment is necessary. Short, <sup>l</sup>to-the-point answers are often better. An effort to comment in our own words will doubtless increase our understanding of what is printed and be more motivating to others. Take the initiative to look up and make application of cited scriptures. Comments that make practical application of points or include relevant experiences are appreciated by all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study conductors do well to review their teaching methods from time to time. They can ask themselves: Am I commenting too frequently? Are the main points being highlighted? Are the brothers being encouraged to participate? Is the Bible being used during the study? Am I well prepared? Other elders designated by the body of elders as good teachers should be scheduled to conduct periodically. (Note September 1977 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service, </span><span class="font12">page four.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Do you have a hearty spiritual appetite? (Matt. 5:3) If so, then you are invited to the King’s table to partake with all of his people in the abundance of spiritual good things generously provided through his &quot;slave” during the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study. May all thanks and praise go to Jehovah, our Grand Teacher. —Isa. 54:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Work Brings Personal Benefits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jeru'-salem, and you must put a mark on the foreheads of the men that are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the midst of it” That was the way the man with the recorder’s inkhorn was to carry out his commission from Jehovah in the final days of ancient Jerusalem.—Ezek. 9:2-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Today, throughout the world, a similar work is carried out by Jehovah’s Witnesses by means of a vigorous house-to-house campaign of taking the good news to people, searching for those who want to learn the truth and warning others who do not want to hear. Have you taken up this lifesaving work? Are you sharing in it as fully as your personal circumstances will allow?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our efforts in this work are rewarded in the realization that thousands are helped each year to learn the truth. We also receive numerous personal benefits when we regularly and diligently share in the house-to-house preaching work. How? Well, consider the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">• It sharpens our appreciation for the truth. The more we engage in the house-to-house work, the more we come to see the “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things. We are convinced that Bible prophecy is being fulfilled and we appreciate that the only solution to mankind’s problems lies with Jehovah’s kingdom through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">© It helps us to develop and perfect the fruitage of the spirit. Obviously it takes all the fruits of the spirit—love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control—for us to meet the challenge of the house-to-house work and persist in it. —Gal. 5:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• It helps us to conquer fear of man. Do you recall how you felt the first time you went from house to house? Gradually, though, we come to realize that the allimportant thing is to preach the good news and to sound the warning, and, in comparison, men and their rebuffs become quite insignificant. Like Jeremiah, we come to feel the assurance of Jehovah’s backing, which, in turn, builds up our faith.—J er. 1:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• It keeps us humble. We soon learn that it is not in our own strength or ability that we can carry on this work. Rather, as long as we remain humble and are “not rebellious” and do “not turn in the opposite direction,” Jehovah will give us “the tongue of the taught ones” and we will know “how to answer.”—Isa. 50:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• It strengthens our ability to defend the truth. To be able to use the sharp, two-edged sword, God’s Word the Bible, effectively, we need practice. As we regularly use the Bible in the house-to-house work, we find it is “alive and exerts power.”—Heb. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• It is invigorating spiritually and physically. Regular participation in the house-to-house work helps to keep us spiritually alert and results in a good conscience, contributing to our joy. For many, the physical exertion and exercise involved has brought about improvement in physical health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Considering the many benefits that the house-to<sup>j</sup>house work brings both to those who listen to us and to ourselves, surely we have every reason to “stay by these things,” that is, to share in it fully and regularly.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>

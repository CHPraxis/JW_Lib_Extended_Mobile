<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world . . . the world hates you.” (John 15:19) With those words Jesus Christ told his followers about one of the problems in life that Christians would face, namely, the hatred of the world under the influence and control of Satan the Devil. History bears out the truth of those words. That hatred was expressed in all its fury against Jesus who was impaled at the hands of those of “the world” under the direction of Satan. And it has been expressed since that time against the followers of Jesus earth wide right down to our present generation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Since there would be this intense hatred from the world, it can readily be appreciated that when Jesus gave the commandment to his disciples to love one another it would take on great meaning in their lives. In fact, Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) The need” for this love be-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION MEETINGS—PART IV A Provision to Help Us Make Disciples</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ was a disciplemaker! He also taught his disciples to share in the preaching and disciple-making work as well. (Matt. 10:5; 11:1) Those early disciples recognized the importance of sharing the truth with others in compliance with Jesus’ command as recorded at Matthew 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Likewise, today, the heartfelt desire of each Christian should be to influence others to follow Jesus Christ and become his disciples. What a grand privilege we have to engage in ‘publicly declaring’ the truth of God’s Word in a manner worthy of the “good news.” (Rom. 10:9, 10, 13, 14) If we appreciate that our salvation as well as that of those to whom we preach is at stake, we will be moved to share whole-souled in this lifesaving work. (1 Tim. 4:16; Acts 20:26, 27) This will enhance our appreciation for the numerous provisions that stimulate our desire to share fully in the preaching and disciple-making work. One of these provisions is the service meeting.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">comes more and more apparent, living, as we are, deep in the time of the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERCOMING DIFFERENCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Due to our imperfection there may be times when we fail to express love for our brothers. There may be differences in personality, individual likes and dislikes, differences in cultural background, and so on. When we encounter such differences we need to consider seriously the race for life into which all of us as followers of Christ have entered. While it is easy to find weaknesses and imperfections in our brothers, if we have the mind of Christ we will look to find their strong points, those areas in life where they are striving to exhibit faith and godly works. We will recognize that we, too, have certain traits that are not necessarily admired by others, and yet we want understanding of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">our weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Paul, in Colossians 3:13, 14, said this: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS RECEIVED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Information presented on the service meeting serves to build us up spiritually and equips us to share more zealously and effectively in the preaching and disciplemaking work. Consider specific ways in which we personally benefit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We are encouraged to participate regularly in the house-to-house work, not only because of this fine apostolic example, but also because of the fine results obtained. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font11">often provides detailed presentations that we can use in the field. Suggestions are given showing how to start conversations, use tact, adapt ourselves to different situations, and so forth. Additionally, we are shown how we can assist our brothers to become more effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Service meetings also help us to appreciate better our responsibility to return and help persons who display an interest in the truth. We have been shown why we need to keep accurate records </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

Jesus was appointed by his Father as head of Christian congregation. (Eph. 1:22, 23) He appointed a “faithful and discreet slave” class to care for his interests on earth. (Matt. 24:45-47) Individual Christians must recognize arrangement and work closely with organization. (Isa. 2:2, 3; Heb. 10: 23, 24) It is recommended that we develop a regular program of progressively directing students to organization. A few minutes can be taken at conclusion of weekly study to do so. Subjects can be considered, such as location and function of Kingdom Hall; purpose of each meeting and how conducted; no collections at meetings (Matt. 6:2, 3); appointed elders have no titles (Matt. 23:8-10); all in congregation share in witnessing and teaching (Acts 8:1, 4). What other topics can be considered? What visual aids could be used? Why is it necessary for students to learn function of the organization on both global and local scale?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have demonstration of qualified publisher directing student to organization by covering a specific point outlined above. Review key points, as time allows.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>ATTEND THE 1981 DISTRICT CONVENTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. What a fine theme to stimulate our desire to attend the 1981 district convention! With worsening conditions and nationalism abounding in the world, how necessary that faithful Christians assemble together to strengthen their loyalty to Jehovah and his kingdom. (Heb. 10: 23-25) A truly fine opportunity will be afforded to meet together with thousands of loyal brothers and sisters at over 100 locations this coming summer, as listed in the February 15 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> (English). Additionally, we are providing the following necessary information to enable you to make your arrangements to attend, as well as to assist others who may need help to be there with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">’Last year the Society instituted a new system of rooming for district conventions in order to assist everyone needing accommodations and to simplify the overall rooming operation. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service, </span><span class="font0">February 1980.) For the most part, this arrangement proved to be very beneficial for all concerned and will be used again this year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Under this arrangement you will make all your own arrangements directly with the hotel/motel. In most cases you will pay much less than the regular rates charged by that hotel/motel since the convention has arranged for a large number of rooms to be set aside for this purpose. Already many managers of good quality hotels and motels in the convention cities have been approached and the best rates possible have been negotiated with them for those attending each convention. A number of rooms in each of these hotels and motels have been blocked off to be assigned by the hotel/motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. In most cases, by the middle of January 1981, your congregation will have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates to those attending the convention and the phone number to be used in making your reservations, along with other information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font0">As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization, you should select the facility where you would prefer to stay. Then phone the hotel or motel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">immediately,</span><span class="font0"> identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s deposit (credit card, cashier’s check or money order) will be required at all locations and should be sent to them as soon as your reservations are confirmed. This deposit should be sent to the hotel or motel directly, well in advance of the cutoff date listed on the sheet (s) received from the rooming department. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Motels and/or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms without a deposit or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date.</span><span class="font0"> If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodation you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who may desire the accommodation. The convention rooming department will be monitoring the arrangement and will provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels/motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. Remember, therefore, that it will be your responsibility to contact the hotel/motel and make reservations based on the information provided on the list. If the hotel/motel you call first is filled, then it will be necessary for you to call the next one you have selected from the list, and so on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font0">A few conventions find it necessary to use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. In most cases, the congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel/motel listing is sent. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions set out on the list that will be sent to the congregation by the convention rooming department.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font0">Most arrangements to care for those with special needs have customarily originated at the local congregation where such ones attend. Elders and others who are aware of such circumstances have lovingly extended help, which is commendable. This has often involved taking others with them in their own group—those in full-time service, the elderly, infirm or needy ones. Also they have cared for their needs in other ways, such as assisting them in making arrangements or even aiding them financially, if possible and where needed. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17, 18) We are confident that such loving concern will continue to be shown’to all such loyal ones. (John 13:35; Gal. 6:10) However, the convention rooming department will function to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who can neither be cared for by themselves nor by those in the congregation where they attend. Such ones may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at this time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though he forwards it to the convention rooming department, the individual (s) will be notified of the accommodations directly by the rooming department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. (The one with special needs should </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention rooming department needs the congregation convention coordinator’s verification of the circumstances.) Both private homes and hotel/motel accommodations will be used in caring for those with special needs, according to their circumstances. Please keep in mind that private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not made available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money, such as for a vacation. Also, private home accommodations are for the convention period only. It hardly seems proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates for extra days so as to visit vacation spots or do other things in the area before or after the convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Each time I start to give a witness either from house to house or informally, I try to think of the person I am speaking to as a potential fellow Witness.” This expression, made by an experienced brother who has enjoyed good success in helping others to learn the truth, gives all of us something to think about. (John 3:16; Matt. 20:28) Our own frame of mind as we work in the field service has a direct bearing on how successful our ministry will be. Do we really have in mind seeing these people again and progressively teaching them the truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POSITIVE FROM THE START</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> A positive approach at the very first call from house to house, or as we begin to speak informally to others, is the first step in progressively teaching the truth. If we keep the desired end result in mind from the very beginning, we will be alert to keep an accurate house-to-house record and make definite plans to return as soon as possible to cultivate any interest we may have found.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Theocratic gatherings for worship each week play a vital role in our steady development as Christians. (Heb. 10:24, 25; Col. 1:9, 10) This regular intake of strengthening spiritual nourishment fortifies and equips us to face the everincreasing pressures of our time, while we are having an active share in the preaching work. (Acts 2:40-42) To achieve the greatest amount of good for ourselves and our brothers, each of us can contribute toward improving the quality of our meetings.—Gal. 6:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY OF ELDERS AND MINISTERIAL SERVANTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Since elders are primarily charged with the work of teaching, they should be alert to help one another to improve in speaking and teaching ability. The success of each meeting depends on their presiding “in real earnest.” (Rom. 12:8; 1 Tim. 4:13, 16) When assignments are well-prepared and enthusiastically presented, the meetings will motivate us to greater acts of faith and loyalty. Elders responsible for arranging ducting progressive Bible studies, not only are helping the newly interested one to gain Bible knowledge rapidly, but also are training the potential new Witness to be dependable and regular in helping others. ■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> It is good to direct interested persons to the organization from the very beginning. Tell them about the congregation meetings and invite them to attend. Explain the work we do and talk about the worldwide organization of Kingdom-preachers. Show them the value of the various publications we use and be sure to build up enthusiasm for circuit assemblies and the larger yearly conventions. By introducing the newly interested persons to others in the congregation, you will help them to see that the Christian congregation is truly a brotherhood that enjoys wholesome fellowship that cannot be found elsewhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Our yeartext for 1981 affords excellent opportunities to discuss witnessing with the newly interested ones. We can encourage them to begin speaking to friends, relatives and acquaintances about</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">meeting parts should use the most qualified brothers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In view of the recent adjustment in the length of some meetings, those who have assignments will want to give special attention to staying within the allotted time. Sufficient time has been allowed to cover main points and make local application to congregational needs. However, trying to cover too much material in a brief period can detract from the richness of our presentation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> All of us, however, can add to the instructiveness and upbuilding quality of our meetings by preparing so as to participate fully. Some families choose to prepare for meetings by reading a portion of the assigned material each day. If only a few minutes daily are used in this way, think of how much more pleasurable our weekly meetings will be!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">Note: No service meeting is being planned for the week of August 23' to allow an open week for attending a district convention. This open week can be shifted to the actual week you attend a district convention in June, July or August. The week of August 30 is set aside for reviewing highlights of things learned at the district convention.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font14">Announcements. Tie in yeartext, Psalm 145:10, 11, with encouragement to share in first-Sunday-of-the-month field service. Meeting tonight designed to equip us for effective use of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness </span><span class="font14">book and new tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font14">Animated talk encouraging all to share in Sunday field service. What an accomplishment it would be if everyone in assigned territory could be presented with the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book and tract during June and July! Can congregation do this? Suggest and demonstrate variety of effective presentations featuring book or tract. Include suggestions for children or new publishers and use of Topic for Conversation with offer. Tract may be left free with all who will accept it and in a place where it is out of sight when no one is at home. Special assistance will be given to help us use the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book in the field and in starting home Bible studies.

Refer to Mark 6:30 and give brief report on last Sunday’s field service, including brief experiences from those who participated. Commend congregation for work done. Encourage continued participation in field service throughout remainder of month. Introduce following part. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font14">min: Help Those Who Doubt. Many of the persons we meet in field service are disillusioned with religion in general. They may be atheists or claim to be agnostics who, in effect, say, T don’t know if there is a God or not.’ The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book is a powerful tool for reasoning with those who doubt the existence of God or the authenticity of the Bible. What are some specific points from the book that we can use in the field? (Elder handling this part should encourage audience to follow along in own </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book and perhaps mark paragraphs that they would like to use in the field.) Discuss paragraph 17 on page 16, along with picture on page 17. How could this stimulate the thinking of householder or encourage him to read book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As time permits, discuss paragraph 19 on page 28 and paragraph 22 on page 19. These are points that can motivate doubters to consider why it is reasonable to have faith in a loving Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What about the authenticity of the Bible? How do paragraphs 4 and 5 on page 22 help a person see why it is logical for God to provide a book for mankind? How can the illustrations be used effectively? Some say Bible was written by men. How can paragraphs 14, and 15 on page 26 be used to reason with such ones? By tactfully using the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book in a way that stimulates thinking, we can help those who doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">Discuss talking points from current magazines, helping all to prepare for sharing in magazine work on Saturday. Arrange for some who are effective in placing magazines to suggest appropriate presentations. These may be offered from their seats in the audience. Experiences may be used to show how the brothers or other persons in the field have benefited from reading the magazines. Give brief review of field service arrangements for weekend. Encourage making special effort to work with magazines on Saturday. Announce specific arrangements. If appropriate, tie in brief remark related to this day’s text from </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>

Many who claim to believe in God do not see the Bible as an aid in coping with life’s problems. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book, has many points that can be useful in showing such ones the practicality of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The picture on page 41 can be used as a talking point with people who want relief from the pressures of life. We can discuss the many difficulties being experienced in a particular community and select a topic appropriate for the householder. Take </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">stress</span><span class="font14"> for example. What are some of the causes of stress? How does the Bible give practical counsel that will help to minimize stress? Note the points in paragraphs 12 and 13 on page 44 and paragraph 17 on page 46. Fine admonition is given in the Bible to combat loneliness. Discuss the points made in paragraphs 21 and 22 on page 48. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Money problems</span><span class="font14"> afflict many. We can use the scriptures highlighted in paragraphs </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">4 through</span><span class="font14"> 6 on pages 51 and 52 to get the householder’s viewpoint on the value of industriousness.

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Worked Your Territory Thoroughly?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">_ <sup>1</sup> How do you view the territory in which you preach? Does your work in the territory assigned, reflect diligence and heartfelt interest in people or indifference and apathy? One diligent service overseer from Texas expressed his disciplined steadfastness this way: “Every time I knock on a new door I become obligated to another person.” Whether we regularly share in covering group or personal territory, we should display our deep concern for those “hungering and thirsting for righteousness.” —Matt. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONAL AND GROUP TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Establishing clearly defined territory boundaries is a God-directed arrangement. (2 Cor. 10:13; Gal. 2:9) Initially this ensures a more thorough witness being given. It also prevents much overlapping of effort that at times has resulted in irritated householders. In some instances several publishers unknowingly made return visits on the same householder. Thorough organization of territory coverage will help to alleviate this problem of duplicating our efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> While territory should periodically be worked by different publishers, some congregations arrange to have the same persons work a territory, or a selected portion thereof, several times. It may be advantageous to know the householder’s name. Also, householders are more inclined to open the door when the caller is someone they recognize.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> When the same publishers work a territory it results in an economy of effort, time and expense. How so? First of all, the not-at-homes, return visits and Bible studies will be in a more confined area, not scattered about in a number of different territories requiring extensive travel. This, in turn, will create added incentive to call back on </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font14"> those showing interest in our message. If you have been assigned a personal section of territory, why not put forth a diligent, organized effort to become acquainted with all those in your part of the “field.” (Matt. 13:38) In doing so, we reflect Jehovah’s own merciful attitude and recognize our </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font14"> accountability toward the lives of people in our community.—Jonah 4:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OFTEN-WORKED TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Many publishers are finding an increasing number of not-at-homes when calling at conventional times. Rather than making a long list of homes to which we seldom return, in some areas publishers have </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font14"> reworked the not-at-homes. A difference of an hour or two has resulted in finding some of these individuals who had stepped out momentarily at the time we first called. This prompt, systematic return to all not-at-homes will in effect extend the amount of available territory. Thus, large sections of territory are not needed, and such an arrangement is helpful when the congregation’s territory allotment is small.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> If we take our responsibility seriously, we will want to be certain that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font14"> persons in our territory are visited. Persistence and a willingness to fulfill our commission are needed, particularly in rural territory, “difficult” or often-worked areas and those not easily accessible to us. This requires that we personally keep accurate records of our results at each door. Do not be satisfied with making just one return visit, but persist in calling several times where interest is shown. As a result of such steadfastness, one publisher now has 80 individuals on his magazine route and conducts a number of Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Industriousness, diligence and determination are all qualities we must cultivate if we are to accomplish our ministry. (Ezek. 9:11; John 17:4) Our service to God should not be conducted in a casual, haphazard way. But, rather, our genuine love for Jehovah and our fellowman should motivate us to review carefully how we have been carrying out our preaching commission.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS )</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On Every Appropriate Occasion</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist was keenly interested in showing his love and appreciation for Jehovah. He said: “It is good to give thanks to Jehovah and to make melody to your name, O Most High; to tell in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">morning</span><span class="font14"> about your loving-kindness and about your faithfulness during the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">nights.</span><span class="font14"> (Ps. 92:1, 2) Do you feel that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Three young brothers who wanted to serve as auxiliary pioneers got an early start. In tneir town there was a transportation center where people took trains and buses into the city to work. The three young brothers were there at 6:30 each morning. Between 6:30 and 8:00 they placed many magazines as they spoke to people about Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Late afternoon and early evening hours have also proved to be good times to share in the service. Many brothers and sisters have observed that, while in some territories they find few persons at home when doing house-to-house work during the day, they find many more at home in the early evenings. Some people are more relaxed at the end of the day. Oftentimes men are pleased to have someone to talk with, and it is the men who are rarely found at home weekdays.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In just a few weeks we will be attending the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention. Your lapel card may open up opportunities to present the good news. Be sure to wear it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> It may be that you have found other ways to draw people into conversation. For instance, after making a purchase, some brothers and sisters just ask the clerk: ‘Do you like to read?’ After receiving a reply, they reach for a magazine or other publication and tell the person, ‘Here is an article that I enjoyed reading very much.’ They show it to the person and ask if he would like to read it also. If it is an older magazine, they may say: ‘I have finished reading it. Would you like to read it, too?’ Current publications can be offered for a contribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> When sharing in the house-to-house work remember that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">we are looking for people.</span><span class="font14"> During the summertime people are often in the yard or walking along the sidewalk. Someone may be working on his car. Children may be playing in the street. People watch you going from house to house. By all means stop and satisfy their curiosity. You may find an excellent opportunity to present the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> As you endeavor to reach out to speak to more people, pray to Jehovah that he will direct you and bless your efforts. With his blessing you may have the pleasure of presenting the good news to someone who is hungering and thirsting for the truth. Yes, with Jehovah’s blessing, we can enjoy both happiness and success in our efforts to present the good news on every appropriate occasion.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">• Does your congregation get enough magazines? In view of the increased activity of your congregation as they engage In the magazine-day activity twice a month, it may be that you should be thinking of increasing your order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">• The special talk that was given in April, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">On Whose Promises Do You Rely!,</span><span class="font13"> will become a part of the regular series of talks given by the elders in the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Congregation Meetings </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font14">stration, prepare well in advance and allow ample time to rehearse with those assisting you. Reports indicate that some are rehearsing school or service meeting parts for the first time on the night they are to be given. If this is being done during other parts of the program, obviously this will detract from the importance of our worship and bring little spiritual benefit to ourselves or others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Real-life experiences also add much to our enjoyment of the meetings. (Prov. 15:30) The elders appreciate it when you make them aware of some interesting development in your field ministry. As these are shared with the congregation, many others can be encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">y Appreciation for our precious privilege of meeting together should impel each one of us to explore every channel available to us so that our meetings yield the richest possible dividends. Not only by our regular attendance each week, but also through our advance preparation and readiness to participate, will we make a genuine contribution to the quality of our congregational gatherings for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">reservations on their own before receiving the listing of facilities that are cooperating with the convention rooming department, it could cause a breakdown in some negotiations. This could occur at locations used year after year where brothers, based on rumor or assumption, have been accustomed to making very early reservations. Also, It could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose not to use the hotels and motels listed but, for one reason or another, make their own arrangements with facilities that have not cooperated fully with the convention rooming arrangement. We hope to make the listing broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels/-motels that give the best cooperation. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to see that delegates are accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, according to their circumstances, so as to be refreshed and able to enjoy fully the fine spiritual benefits of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING YOUR CONVENTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> It is our hope that every lover of Jehovah will be in attendance at the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention, if at all possible. In most cases, you will be attending at the location nearest to your congregation, or where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, on the dates recommended for your circuit or portion thereof. Please find listed on page 6, in date order,, each convention city and the circuits, or portions thereof, recommended to attend each convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) may have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend at a particular location, such as or 14, it simply means that those congregations in the part of the circuit closest to that convention would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another convention closest to them as shown elsewhere on the list.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> Your determination to be among those attending the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention will bring rich rewards as Jehovah blesses your efforts. May your joy be made complete by planning to be present for every session from beginning to end, all four days.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO THE BODY OF ELDERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon receipt of this insert, it will be the responsibility of the convention coordinator to meet together with the presiding overseer before the next service meeting. They can determine from the circuit list shown which city and dates their congregation is to attend, based on the circuit or portion thereof that the congregation is in as of the end of February. (If the coordinator is caring for both positions, he should meet with another member of the congregation service committee.) Where a fraction of a circuit (%&gt; <sup>1</sup>4, and so forth) is involved, they should determine whether their congregation is part of the fraction nearest to that convention and, if so, plan on attending there. Then please announce at the next service meeting as well as the following </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> study the location and dates recommended by the Society for the congregation. It may be good to underline on the circuit list the recommended convention city and dates the congregation is to attend and post that portion of the insert on the information board for the benefit of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In nearly every case, the elder serving as the convention coordinator will be conducting the service meeting part covering this insert as scheduled, as well as making other announcements and handling convention material on the meetings. This will serve to acquaint the congregation with their convention coordinator, as well as better enable him to coordinate convention matters. When covering this insert on the service meeting, it would be good to have a qualified brother read the key numbered paragraphs that apply to your congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the elders should be informed as to convention arrangements. They will want to cooperate fully, offering suggestions to assure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material. We appreciate very much your enthusiastic support of and kind attention to these matters.</span></p>

Have not these suggestions aided us to be more concerned about people and our responsibility toward those who respond?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Conducting Bible studies has also been given considerable attention. What will help more of us to share in this privilege of service? In an article entitled “Is Your Witnessing Purposeful?” in the April 1979, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service, </span><span class="font14">the question was raised: “Do we make the finding of sheeplike ones and the desire for a Bible study a subject of our prayers? (1 John 5:14) After praying, do we become easily discouraged if such prayers seemingly go unanswered for a time? Or, do we persevere in our prayers and work in harmony with what we are praying for?” Many apply the fine suggestions and encouragement given at service meetings with respect to the Bible study activity. Are you doing so? If so, has it not made you a more effective teacher?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Practical suggestions about informal witnessing have enabled many of us to take advantage of daily opportunities to give a Kingdom witness. Have you enjoyed interesting experiences by witnessing informally? What particular suggestions helped you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Much attention has been given to the needs of young people. Service meetings have pointed out how they can develop spiritually, share fully in field activity and cope with problems at school or in divided households. Many youths have expressed appreciation for program parts that were designed especially for them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVANCE PREPARATION NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Elders and ministerial servants should prepare program parts well and employ the art of teaching. Endeavor to follow closely the direction outlined in the section “Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples.” When preparing your assignment, ask yourself: Why is this part appropriate, and how can I make it helpful and applicable to the congregation? What are the main points that the audience should learn? What methods should I employ to teach effectively? (or, pp. 97, 98) The presiding overseer may provide assigned brothers with helpful suggestions, as needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> After receiving a new issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font14"> it is good to read it through. Later make a more careful study of the printed</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Circuit overseers regularly visit all congregations in an effort to stimulate and spiritually encourage their brothers. When they complete their visit, they submit a written report to the Society, leaving a copy with the congregation. How can these reports be best utilized by the elders?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">information in preparation for each week’s service meeting. Where audience participation is called for, be prepared to comment. (Heb. 10:23, 24) Such participation builds up faith and is an expression of our love for the brothers and for Jehovah. It also aids us in retaining points we have learned so that we can apply them in the field and in our daily life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> So, there are many good reasons to do our utmost to derive the fullest possible benefit from the service meeting. It is one of the provisions designed to help us to accomplish our disciple-making work and to gain divine approval. —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Love . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also. But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” We need to remember that a spiritual person is distinguished by his readiness to demonstrate love toward his brothers, “putting up with” them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WAYS TO SHOW LOVING CONCERN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> As spiritual persons we can seek ways to show our love for the whole association of brothers. One of the primary steps required is to get acquainted with them, come to know something of their background, personality and way of life. Try to understand why they say and do things in a certain way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> It is also good to find ways to share with them in some form of the preaching and disciple-making work. Working with them from door to door and in other features of the ministry, seeing their zeal for Jehovah, perhaps understanding some of the problems they may face in sharing in certain service activity—all of this will enhance our Christian love and concern for them. In this way we will also have opportunity to exchange experiences, the joys, the problems encountered in doing the Kingdom work as part of the earth-wide association of brothers. Thus we can come to enjoy an interchange</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font14"> book, page 86, outlines this arrangement, stating in part: “Before leaving the congregation, but after his meeting with the body of elders, the circuit overseer fills out a report to the branch office on what service he rendered during his visit, making observations on the spiritual condition of the congregation, matters that were discussed with the elders, and so forth.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> This report should be circulated to all elders so that they can personally review it and make notes, where needed. It should also be considered at subsequent elders’ meetings as an aid to analyzing the needs of the congregation as well as the observations and suggestions of the circuit overseer. Elders will want to act upon the suggestions made in this report, applying these to the congregation’s activity. To this end, they can make good use of the time set aside in the service meeting for considering local needs. If proper use is made of this report, both the local elders and the congregation as a whole can benefit more fully from the visits of the traveling overseers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">of encouragement.—Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> And there is the opportunity at times to visit with others, inviting them to our home, if possible, or going to their home. The more we come to appreciate the common work and service we all share together as brothers, the more we will come to have love for the whole association of brothers and care for one another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> This broadened view will promote unity and cooperation in the congregation. When others visit, or newly interested ones attend our meetings, they will be impressed by the warmth of loving consideration that all have for each other. Seeing this will be of assistance to them in coming out of the world, a world that will hate them for leaving it in favor of association with those who have found the true faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> How comforting and heartwarming it is to be able to say: ‘Yes, this world hates me, even as Jesus said, but my brothers, the whole association of them earth wide, love me and I love them.’ How grateful we can be for that! By examining our own love for our brothers we can see where there is need for improvement so that in deed and in truth all will know we are disciples of the Master, Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Making Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In his parable of the sower, Jesus compared the spreading of Kingdom truth to a farmer sowing literal seed. Not all the seed would sprout and produce, but some would fall on good soil and grow. This would bring joy to the sower. The spiritual sowing and reaping we participate in today likewise brings great joy as Jesus promised. —John 4:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> After our initial sowing of seed by means of a literature placement or simply a Scriptural discussion, further cultivation is needed. This is usually best accomplished by making return visits. Since far more literature is placed than return calls are made, there is a great potential for making effective return visits. Some may hold back from making such calls, thinking that only the skilled and outgoing publishers are qualified to make return visits. However, it is not as difficult as some may have imagined.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Having made the first friendly contact, you have common ground for the return visit. So when should the second call be made and what can be said to the one showing interest? In some cases, if the person has shown genuine interest, a return visit can be made as soon as a day or two after the initial contact. While he may or may not have had opportunity to read any literature that was left with him, your first visit will be fresh in his mind. Waiting too long may allow the interest to wane.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">* As for what to speak about when you return, a helpful suggestion is to lay a good foundation first on the initial call and then build on it. Some record should be kept of what you spoke about. If possible, find out the name of the individual and then on the return visit you can greet that person by name. Be warm and friendly and indicate you have something additional to share with the person. If no one is at home, try again at a different time. Be persevering. Lives are involved and we want to make every effort to cultivate further the initial interest shown. In some cases you might even phone before leaving for the territory to ensure that someone, will be home, impressing the person with the importance of your call.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Preparation is the key to success. Before making the call, think about what you wish to consider with the person. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Discussion</span><span class="font14"> offers some fine suggestions on various subjects of interest, such as “Bible,” “Earth,” “Jehovah, God,” “Kingdom,” “Last Days.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ _</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Some do not make return visits because they do not schedule a definite time for them. Return visits can be made in the evenings, on weekends, just after completing house-to-house calls, or at other times convenient to your personal schedule. All are appropriate. Your joy will greatly increase as you regularly share in this important field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In view of the fine success we have enjoyed in placing the pocketsize books with the public in the past, February is a month that will feature one of the 192-page books on a contribution of 60c. It is hoped that during the month you will make time available for return visits on those potential sheeplike persons you contact in your field service activity.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Unworked Territory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">Some congregations have territory that has not been worked in the past year or more. We have asked the circuit overseer to make arrangements for other congregations in or outside the circuit to help cover territory that has not been worked during the past year. Please inform your circuit overseer if you are available to help out in this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There are 305 counties or parts of counties in the United States that are not assigned to any congregation. This territory needs to be worked also. Those interested in helping out should check with their congregation secretary for information from the Society concerning unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As we all have a full share in the work of Kingdom-preaching, it is hoped that a good witness will be given in all our territory this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">• Is it proper to write to the Society or its branch offices for addresses of persons we can write to as pen pals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We recommend that publishers who wish to correspond with brothers In other cities ana even in foreign countries work such matters out for themselves. Oftentimes many fine friendships have resulted from acquaintances made at assemblies. Then by means of regular correspondence it has been possible to develop a warm,* enduring friendship. There is nothing wrong in such personal correspondence. However, addresses for such correspondence purposes must be obtained on an individual basis. All the addresses in the Society's files and in congregation files are confidential and they cannot be released for personal use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some schools encourage correspondence with pen pals as training in certain courses. In some Instances younger publishers have witnessed effectively by means of correspondence and have succeeded In stimulating genuine interest in the truth. It Is up to each individual, however, to decide if he will participate in such a school-sponsored program of letter writing. Those who do write to worldly persons, however, do well to keep in mind giving a Kingdom witness rather than cultivating an Interest in worldly affairs, in view of the warning against •‘bad associations” given at 1 Corinthians 15:33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s glorious kingship. (Ps. 145:10, 11) They can share the basic truths they are learning. When they have begun to attend meetings regularly and have brought their lives into harmony with basic Christian requirements, we can invite them to enroll in the Theocratic School and to share with us in field service.—Ps. 50:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL CAN HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>s</sup> When new ones attend congregation meetings, others in the congregation can influence them to make progress in the truth. How deeply impressed some people have become upon observing the godly conduct of Jehovah’s people in general! A warm and friendly atmosphere among both young and old at the Kingdom Hall, along with obvious manifestations of holy spirit, have caused many persons to recognize that ‘God is really among us.’ (1 Cor. 14:25) Congregation book study conductors should be attentive to the new ones, encouraging them to associate with the neighborhood book study group and begin to share in field service. Especially do the elders in the congregation have opportunity to give encouragement to the newly associated ones as they Welcome them at the meetings and offer spiritual assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Most of us who are in the truth today can reflect on the loving assistance we received from different brothers and sisters as we were coming into the truth. Our appreciation for the progressive training and encouragement we received over the years moves us to want to help other new ones that are coming to Jehovah’s house today. (Mic. 4:1, 2) By having a full share in progressively teaching the truth to others, we can rejoice with our part in fulfilling Jesus’ command to go and make disciples. —Matt. 28:19.</span></p>

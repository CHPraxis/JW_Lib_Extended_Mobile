<p><span class="font3">Proclaim the Kingdom Hope to Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What hope should Christians proclaim? Certainly not some manmade political hope! History shows that all such hopes are futile. Truly, human schemes are unable to provide for mankind’s lasting needs and salvation. (Ps. 146:3) The only real hope is the Kingdom for which Jesus taught his disciples to pray.—Matt. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Yes, we have good reason to proclaim the Kingdom hope to people in our territory. Jehovah’s people know the Kingdom is God’s instrument to rid the universe of Satan and all who support his rule. The Kingdom will clear Jehovah’s name of all the reproach that has been heaped upon it for nearly 6,000 years. And, happily, the Kingdom will administer to mankind the ransoming power of Jesus’ sacrifice, relieving all suffering and pain. Under its millennial rule, billions now sleeping in death will be resurrected.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MAKE USE OF &quot;LET YOUR KINGDOM COME&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Jesus foretold that in the time of the end his disciples would be preaching the “good news of the kingdom.” (Matt. 24:14) We are truly happy to have a share in proclaiming to others what mankind’s real nope is—God’s kingdom. At our “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions we were thrilled to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents-Are Your Children Growing Spiritually?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a blessing it is to have children who love to serve Jehovah! What joy it brings to the hearts of devoted parents. The apostle John reflected that feeling regarding his spiritual children when he wrote, “No greater cause for thankfulness do I have than these things, that I should be hearing that my children go on walking in the truth.”—3 John 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> “But how do you get your children to be spiritual in their outlook?” many parents have asked. The question is understandable when you see the satanic pressures imposed on the young today. The answers from parents who have been successful are helpful. “The number one requirement is setting a good example in spirituality yourself,” said one father. This brother, a busy elder with a family of four children to look after, takes time to be with his children. Their life is centered around the Kingdom. They talk about spiritual things as a family. When they go receive a new instrument to assist us in this God-given work—the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.” </span><span class="font11">During December, we have our first opportunity to use it from door to door as we offer it along with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Have you thought of how you might proclaim the Kingdom hope with this new book? The opening words of chapter 1 on pages 5 and 6, along with the beautiful picture depicting an earthly paradise, would make a very fitting presentation. Why not review this first paragraph and select points you would like to use that relate to the prayer “Thy kingdom come.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> What practical use can be made of the boxes containing pointed information about the Kingdom? The one on page 11 is entitled “The Reality of God’s Kingdom.” It gives facts about the King, the Heavenly Corulers, its. Realm, the Loyal Subjects, the Laws and the Educational Program. Notice, too, the box entitled “What God’s Kingdom Will Do” on page 25. You might ask the householder a question, such as “Do you recall some of the things the Bible says the Kingdom will do for mankind?” Then call attention to the answer on page 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font11">on vacations, they go as a family and the father makes sure they attend the meetings at the local Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Another factor is making the field service an occasion of joy. One mother stated that she took the children along with her in the field service from the time they were infants. They have always enjoyed the service, not going simply because they had to.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMUNICATE FREELY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How would you know if your children were growing spiritually if you did not communicate freely with them? It would be difficult, to say the least. That is why so many successful parents find it wise to talk freely and openly with their children. They spend time together. Rather than </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">socializing </span><span class="font11">with other adults apart from the children, they have found it best to have the children with them.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Pictures are always eye-catching, especially to young persons. In addition to the beautiful paradise scene on pages 4 and 5, there are excellent pictures on pages 52 and 53, 77, 148 and 149, 180 and 181. You will find the pictures on pages 148 and 149 very useful for a discussion on either the initial call or a return visit, for they outline the Kingdom theme of the Bible along with appropriate illustrations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> These are a few of the excellent features to be found in the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.” </span><span class="font11">It is written in a concise, direct and yet appealing style. The pointed questions for discussion along with Scriptural references will help you to reason with householders on the subject of God’s kingdom. So, let us all be enthusiastic about offering this new publication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Another fine aid in making the Bible and book presentation is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font11"> in the back of the new Bible. You can suggest to householders that these groupings of scriptures will help them to get insight into the subject under discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THOROUGH PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> To make best use of the book it is essential to read it through carefully. Many have done this by now and so are familiar with its contents. The more you know about the Kingdom hope the better you will be able to proclaim it to others. If your heart is warmed by the marvelous Kingdom hope and you have full confidence in its realization, then you cannot help but proclaim it to others with enthusiasm.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Gaining Happiness Through Study of God's Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Wise King Solomon wrote: “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment.” (Prov. 3:13) Have you gained this happiness that Solomon mentioned? The key is ‘finding wisdom and getting discernment.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> This takes effort and time. It involves study of Jehovah’s Word, the taking in of godly knowledge and application of such in our lives. (Prov. 2:2-4) Those who seek understanding and wisdom through regular study of God’s Word will agree that “those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.” —Prov. 3:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One definition of study is: “To fix the mind closely upon a subject.” Our knowing this helps us to understand why those who regularly study God’s Word are happy. They are ‘fixing their minds’ on God’s thoughts and his wonderful promises. Thus, they gain the highest education, a godly one. Feeding one’s mind on God’s truths is a most delightful experience, helping us to continue growing spiritually.—Heb. 5:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW THE ORGANIZATION HELPS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s organization assists us in gaining the happiness we seek. In fact, a fine study program is laid out for us by the “faithful and discreet slave.” How? Well, we noted above that reading is an important part of study, and we have many good things to read, do we not? So it would be important to read the books and each issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> as they come out. Certainly if we recommend that others read the publications, we should first do so ourselves. Truly we can gain happiness from reading such fine publications regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Above all else, our reading must include God’s Word itself. How enjoyable it is to keep up with the weekly assignment of Bible reading for the Theocratic Ministry School program. Many schedule time to read other portions of God’s Word daily. Are you gaining happiness in this way?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">«Preparation for our meetings is another important part of our study program. You will find that you are better able to participate and will remember more of what is discussed. And how can we prepare? Some suggestions are: reading carefully the assigned material, underlining key words or phrases and looking up Scripture texts that are cited but not quoted. Some find it helpful to make notes of related points or scriptures in the margins. The more we can remember and apply, the happier we will be.—John 13:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> What are other things we can include in our Christian study program? Reading and discussing the daily text should be a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">must </span><span class="font11">in Christian homes. Advance preparation for return visits, Bible studies and talks would also be essential. (P;rov. 15:28; 1 Pet. 3:15) Many do research in connection with their weekly Bible reading in order to understand the material better. What a blessing our regular schedule of study can be!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Through your study program do you find ‘delight in the law of Jehovah’? (Ps. 1:2) If so, you are truly blessed and know that getting wisdom from Jehovah “is better than having silver as gain.” (Prov. 3:14) But, if you are unable to keep up with all the reading and study you would like to do, do not get discouraged or give up. Could you, perhaps, adjust your activities so as to have </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">more </span><span class="font11">time to devote to reading and studying? As you do this, you will find that your joy increases as your knowledge of Jehovah grows. Then you will appreciate more fully that wisdom from Jehovah “is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.” —Prov. 3:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this way no age barrier is created. Wise parents also take a keen interest in the children’s activity whether at school or otherwise. Such kindly interest in the children makes it easy for the children to approach their parents when problems arise, being confident that their parents will understand even if they have done something wrong.—Prov. 15:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Some parents have found it prudent to listen carefully to what their children are talking about. They find out what their children are learning inside and outside the home, and then take steps to correct any wrong thinking before it takes root in their children’s hearts and minds. Rather than belittle their expressions, wise parents endeavor to upbuild their children and encourage them to keep up the fight to remain spiritual in this materialistic world. (Eph. 6:10-13) Such loving concern draws parents and children together.—Prov. 24:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDYING GOD’S WORD TOGETHER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A regular family Bible study is another essential in developing spirituality. If children see that</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">their parents are sufficiently interested in Biblical knowledge to set aside time for study each week, they will eventually be helped to do the same thing. In addition to time that is set aside for discussions of a given portion of a book or magazine each week, discerning parents will impart whatever instruction or encouragement their children may need at the moment. Happenings at school or in the neighborhood may reveal a need to consider appropriate material so as to deal with a current problem or face an issue. This is a part of growing up spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROVIDING A SPIRITUAL TREASURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Some parents have mistakenly thought the best thing they could do for their children would be to provide material advantages. Experience has shown that when the parents have given priority to the material things of life, it has all too often led to the parents’ becoming weak spiritually and neglecting their children’s spiritual interests. (Mark 8:36) While they may enjoy a higher standard of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Bible</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> December and January are Bible campaign months. This offers excellent opportunities for encouraging our neighbors to obtain a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> along with the new Bible study aid </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Since most people may have a Bible, why encourage them to obtain the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation? </span><span class="font11">As you will recall at the district convention this past summer, four points were discussed to help us appreciate the value of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> First, we learned that since older and more reliable Bible manuscripts are available now, a modern translation of these documents helps us to have a more correct understanding of the Bible. Secondly, the original Bible languages are now much better understood. Thus the increased knowledge of these languages makes for more understandable translations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The third point mentioned at the convention is that the languages into which the Bible has been translated have undergone changes in the course of years. The English language has undergone a vast number of changes since the 17th century when the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font11"> were produced. Finally, and most importantly, there is the matter of correct understanding of the Bible by the translators.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We cannot escape the fact that erroneous religious beliefs have influenced many Bible translators. One obvious example is where they have failed to stick loyally to God’s Word in the use of God’s distinctive name, Jehovah. Often it has been deliberately covered over. Thus people need a translation that accurately conveys the message found in the original languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> How happy we should be to have a translation where no effort has been spared to ensure accuracy! We need to get the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> into the hands of people. How could you present it at the doors? No doubt, there are several ways that have been effective in your territory. As a suggestion you might try the following, using the new Topic for Conversation:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup>-“Good morning, my name is ----and I am pleased to find you at home. My reason for calling is to share with you the Bible’s solution to mankind’s problems. As you probably have noted, our problems are on the increase despite sincere efforts to bring a change. [Give local examples.] Do you think there will ever be a solution? [Allow for a response.] Notice this encouraging comment in the Bible. [Read Revelation 11:17, 18.] Did you note the solution? God is going to bring to ruin those ruining the earth, thus cleansing it from crime, selfishness, pollution, hunger, wars, and so forth. How? By means of his kingdom. At Matthew 6:10, Jesus told his followers to pray, ‘Let yoiir kingdom come.’ Would you like to know how this is going to come about? Since the answer is found in the Bible, I would like to leave with you a copy of a modern translation along with this book on the subject of the Kingdom for $3.75.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> In the event that you would like to feature the new book, you might say: “Good morning, I am pleased to find you at home as I have come to talk to you about God’s kingdom. Many have wondered why Jesus told his disciples to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come.’ Perhaps you have, too. [Allow for a response.] Would it not be interesting to know what the Kingdom will do for our earth? [Allow for comment.] Notice what this Bible study aid says on the subject here on page 21, paragraph 1. [Read paragraph.] I would like to leave this book with you along with a modern translation of the Bible for just $3.75.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway,” said the psalmist. (Ps. 119:105) People in the world need to understand God’s Word if they are to gain salvation. Jesus ana the early Christians loyally advocated the Word of God. Let us do the same this month by offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> ana the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Your </span><span class="font1">Children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">material living, could it be said that sacrificing one’s spirituality is worth it? Other families have chosen to reduce their standard of living so as hot to lose sight of the real goal. (John 6:27) They have learned to be content with less materially, but have gained spiritually to the blessing of themselves and their children.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Do you have your family’s spiritual condition at heart? If so, why not work to store up a real spiritual treasure together? (Matt. 6:19-21) Help your children to grow spiritually and you, too, will be thankful that your “children go on walking in the truth.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">• The March 15, &nbsp;1981, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">made the point that ordination as a minister of God takes' place at one's baptism. How does this affect our view of those who are qualified to perform marriages ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In each state the requirements for performing marriages may differ somewhat. In some states, cities or communities, the marriage ceremony may be solemnized only by ministers who are duly registered by the local authorities. It is, therefore, essential to check locally to find out what legal requirements are necessary for performing marriages and to comply with them. Please do not write the Society for such Information as we do not have such available for the various states, cities or communities in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because Christian marriage Is a very serious and binding commitment made by two Individuals before Jehovah, the marriage ceremony should be presided over by a well-qualified ordained minister who gives the marriage talk and solemnizes the marriage. Therefore, it Is preferred that congregation elders, men well spoken of in the congregation, care for this responsibility in order that all things take place In proper order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Information dealing with the marriage discourse, ceremony and approved vows Is to be found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">of March 15. 1969, pages 174-179, May 1, 1974, pages 274-277, March 15, 1977, pages 172-185 and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of May 22, 1974, pages 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Arrangements for the use of a Kingdom Hall for marriage should be approved by the body of elders of the congregation. Since the Scriptural direction is to marry “only In the Lord’’ (1 Cor. 7:39), those performing marriages should refrain from solemnizing unequaled marriages, nor should such weddings be held at the Kingdom Hall. If there are any very unusual situations in this connection, It is best to write to the Society about the circumstances involved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">/The apostle Paul encouraged his fellow servants to ‘present their bodies as a sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with their power of reason.’ (Rom. 12: 1) Paul willingly sacrificed himself and was richly rewarded for his sacred service. When we sacrifice our personal pursuits in behalf of Kingdom interests, we too can be confident of Jehovah’s blessing. —Mal. 3:10; Acts 20:20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Servants of Jehovah have always demonstrated the spirit of self-sacrifice in their lives. Imagine for a moment the sacrifices Noah must have made expending his life’s energies building an ark large enough to preserve himself, his close family and the animals through the flood! And while doing that great work, his selfsacrificing course included service as “a preacher of righteousness.” —2 Pet. 2:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Consider the personal sacrifice of Abraham. At God’s command Abraham left his home at 75 years of age to become a temporary resident in a foreign land. (Heb. 11:8-10) It is also encouraging to recall the self-sacrificing spirit of men like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel who had difficult territory assignments. (Ezek. 2:4, 7) Yet all these served unselfishly year after year, confident of Jehovah’s bless</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Training Children in the Way of Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Obedience to God’s requirements leads to life—disobedience to his law leads to sure disappointment and death. This simple but powerful lesson we learn from the experience of Adam and Eve. By continued obedience they could have lived forever, yet they chose to disobey God and died as a result. All Christian parents should ask themselves: What am I teaching my children? Are they learning the rewards of obedience and the consequences of disobedience? Are they learning to love Jehovah from their hearts? What are they learning from my example?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DISCIPLINE MUST BE CONSISTENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To teach obedience it is good for you who are parents to set up reasonable yet clear-cut rules to Elide the conduct of your children, et them see your own example in obeying rules. Warn them about breaking rules—that it leads to sure punishment. Be swift about keeping your word; do not nag, yell or be inconsistent. (Eph. 6:4) ing. Likewise today, Jehovah’s servants make adjustments in their lives in order to share as fully as possible in the preaching work, whether in some faraway place or nearby.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Since this month begins the new service year, it is a good time to reflect on the fine results from the sacrifices we have made thus far and determine what we hope to accomplish during the 1982 service year. Usually it is helpful to set personal goals. For example, would it be possible for you to auxiliary pioneer one or more months this year? Have you been thinking about entering the regular pioneer service? Perhaps by making the necessary sacrifices, this could soon be possible for you. Or, have you been planning on regularly spending more time in field service? If so, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font3"> is the time to put your plans into operation!—Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> As you look back on what you individually have accomplished, you should be able to see where good progress has been made. For example, has your knowledge of God’s Word deepened? Are you cultivating your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Both parents should agree on rules of discipline; both should enforce them to retain the respect of the child. When parents administer loving discipline, children learn that punishment is the penalty for intentional wrongdoing. But they also learn that obedience brings pleasure by means of commendation and rewards. (Eph. 6: 1-3; Heb. 11:6) If your children learn while young that they will most certainly ‘reap what they sow’ you will save them from many disappointments and possible death. —Gal. 6:7; Prov. 23:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Obedience involves </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">listening. </span><span class="font3">Do you teach your children to listen? Are they </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">required</span><span class="font3"> to attend meetings? Also, are they </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">expected </span><span class="font3">to pay attention? Some parents train their children to listen at home. They set aside a regular time to read to their children. During this time youngsters are required to sit still and pay attention. If this is done patiently, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

Are you showing greater appreciation for meetings by your regular attendance and good preparation? Do you comment regularly, thus building up others? Have you been spending more time in field service when your circumstances allow? Or have you in various ways been able to improve the quality of your ministry? If you have been able to accomplish one or more of these things, you have good reason to be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">® We have received some fine experiences from those who have begun to share regularly in the magazine work on the second and fourth Saturdays of the month. The elders in one congregation noted that the first month this arrangement was instituted, the congregation placed over 1,000 magazines, whereas previously they averaged only 550 to 600.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> One pioneer who did not normally engage in field service on Sunday adjusted her schedule so she could go out the first Sunday of the month. Her very first Sunday she placed two books and started two Bible studies with individuals who worked during the week and could study only on Sunday. Jehovah richly blessed her self-sacrificing effort.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> There are other ways we manifest the spirit of self-sacrifice.

<p><span class="font3">^The congregation of God is “a pillar and support of the truth.” (1 Tim. 3:15) As individual members of the congregation, are we doing our part in upholding and supporting the truth? A splendid opportunity currently exists for Jehovah’s Witnesses to make known to millions of persons the truth about creation, as opposed to evolution. Why is this an especially favorable time? 1) As never before, the evolution theory is being strongly disputed. 2) As many students return to their classrooms, pressure is building up on educators to present “the other side,” that is, information about creation. 3) The September 22, 1981, issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> is specially designed to present the facts in a clear manner, pointing to the Bible's truthful account of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To take advantage of this unique opportunity, all are encouraged to put forth an extra effort to distribute this special issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> Members of local school boards, principals and teachers should be made aware of this valuable and useful information. State legislators can be contacted. Copies can be presented to federal</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Counting the time we spend in field service is important but it is not our primary objective. However, it is important to report our field service time accurately. Time spent getting ready for service, attending the meeting for service, and the travel time involved in getting from home to the territory, and so forth, is really not time spent in preaching and teaching, is it? It is understandable that after one gets into the territory and the preaching work has gotten under way, there will be time spent walking or traveling between homes and such can reasonably be counted as time in field service. While the conscience of each publisher is involved in counting time, each should be careful to maintain a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font3"> conscience in this regard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP NEWER ONES TO BE ACCURATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Often it is noted that newer ones need help to understand how to report their activity accurately. If they conduct a Bible study several times during the month, they may wrongly report several Bible Studies instead of just one. A Bible study conducted with an individual or a family should be or state agencies within your territory that concern themselves with education and public schools. If you wish to share in the above aspects of this campaign, please talk to your service overseer who will be coordinating the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Youths of school age have a very special opportunity to show their personal concern for supporting the truth. They can courageously present their teachers with this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> Perhaps some will be allowed the opportunity to give a report in class on the subject. Or, they may arrange for a capable brother to give a talk to their class about the Bible’s account of how life came to be. Not to be forgotten are the parents we meet from door to door, on the streets or informally. Many of them are concerned about what their children are learning in school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Do not allow this opportunity to slip away. (Eph. 5:15, 16) Be ready to “make a defense” with the aid of the September 22 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> (1 Pet. 3:15) Unitedly, let us make known our position by publicly supporting the Bible’s account of creation.—Rom. 1:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">counted as only one Bible study even though it may have been conducted three, four or more times during the month. However, a return visit should be counted for each time the study is conducted and the time should be counted. Some have also improperly reported several return visits because there may have been several interested persons present. However, it is the number of return </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">visits</span><span class="font3"> that should be counted and not the number of persons visited.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Accurate reporting is very helpful to the Society in determining which part of the country or the world may need help in getting the good news preached. It also gives a good picture of the work accomplished. And these reports, posted on the publisher’s record card, help the elders locally in determining how best to assist individuals in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Paul could report that the good news in his day “was preached in all creation that is under heaven.” How encouraging! By your zealous preaching and accurate reporting you are contributing to the same encouraging report in our day. —Col. 1:23; Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Having personal subscriptions will aid us in getting acquainted with each magazine before offering it in the field. In this way most of us will generally be able to read the latest issue before conies are picked up at the Kingdom Hall. Do you have a personal subscription?

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> We know that good preparation is essential to make the best use of magazines in field service. In addition to reading the magazines before offering them to others, a selection can be made of specific points to use for brief presentations. What are some things to consider in preparation sessions? For one thing, we know there is a variety of people to whom we witness. So we are interested, in what may appeal to younger ones, older ones, men, women, professional people, and so forth. Why in time the children will develop the capacity to listen and concentrate on the spoken word and will not be so easily distracted during meetings. Again, parents must set the example, not being easily dispay closer attention and feel more rewarded. Having children look up Bible texts cited by the speakers will keep them alert and will be good training as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes at meetings children become restless after an hour or so. They may turn around and try to get the attention of others. Or they may bring toys or other objects for their personal amusement and this results in distracting others. We must not forget that even the “little ones” in Israel not make notes in your personal copy of points to use, if that will help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Elders and ministerial servants, as well as pioneers, can aid you in using the magazines effectively. You might be able to arrange to work along with them, or other capable publishers, in the service to get suggestions on various ways to present the magazines effectively. Those with more experience can show you how to adapt material to the householder’s needs and interest, and which subjects may be of particular interest to certain ones, and so forth. (2 Tim. 2:2) Newer ones may want to give just a simple presentation. Others may want to widen out and work on the use of questions and other teaching aids.—See the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font3"> Study 10, for suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Younger ones particularly may need help to give meaningful presentations. Initially they may just want to say, “I have the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and we place them for a contribution of 15c each.” However, they should be helped progressively to add to their presentation, using a few words to call attention to ticular point or article.</span></p>

Yet these same children can play for hours at a time without experiencing any such problem. If parents insist that each of their children use the restroom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font3"> the meeting begins, there is usually no real</span></p>

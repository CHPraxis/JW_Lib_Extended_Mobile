<p><span class="font14">Planning Spiritual Activities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Many are the plans in the heart of a man, but the counsel of Jehovah is what will stand.” (Prov. 19:21) People make many different plans. Our plans should always take Jehovah into consideration and be in harmony with his will and purposes. (Jas. 4:15) It is good for us to plan in such a way as to give evidence that we are orderly and are spiritually minded. And were we not all encouraged to ‘Imitate Our Loving God of Order’ at the “Divine Love” District Convention last s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font12">er? —1 Cor. 14:33.</span></p></li>

It would be good to make plans to have as full a share as possible in offering subscriptions from house to house and on return visits. Do we plan to call on interested people who might like to subscribe? Why not make a definite schedule to call on them and offer the subscription? Also, did we meet people last month who wanted to read single issues of the magazines before deciding whether to subscribe? Or did we meet people who’ said they would subscribe later when they had the money? It would be fine to plan to call on these individuals during May. When we consider how much we benefit from</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION MEETINGS-PART VII Getting People to Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Following the outpouring of the holy spirit on Jesus’ disciples at Pentecost, 33 C.E., Christian congregations were formed in one locality after another. These were now the people upon whom God had put his spirit, and they regularly met together. (Acts 2:1; 13:1) Likewise, Jehovah’s people today appreciate the need of regularly attending congregation meetings. We want to encourage all members of the congregation, as well as interested persons living in our territory, to assemble regularly with us.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During the 1980 service year, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">^stions,jip^ Qualified </span><span class="font12">the average attendance for the five</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">weekly meetings was as follows: Public Meeting—124 percent; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study—117 percent; Theocratic School—101 percent; Service Meeting—98 percent; and Congregation Book Study—101 percent. Is that not encouraging? How does your meeting attendance compare with these figures?

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PLANNING FOR SUMMER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Summer will soon be here and with it, of course, convention time. Are our plans all made for attending the district convention? The “Kingdom Loyalty” conventions will be the highlight of the summer’s activities. It may be that you are planning to take a vacation in connection with the convention. In this regard it would be good to keep in mind the privilege we have of sharing the good news with others. Will it be possible to share in service with the congregation where you go so that you can enjoy witnessing in a different territory? Plan to meet with your brothers and share in service where you will be spending your vacation. (Usually Kingdom Hall addresses may be found in the telephone directory.) Even though summer is a time for many to go. on vacation ‘to get away from it all,’ as some say, do not neglect spiritual activity in your plans during this time of’the year. —Rom. 13:14.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Some congregations have already made arrangements to assist in covering unassigned or seldoiu-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">more sheeplike ones to assemble with us each week?—Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

If possible, have school-age publishers answer questions and read scriptures. What should we remember about material possessions? (1 John 2:15, 16) What do we want to keep in mind about this world? (1 John 2:17) Since that is the case, why is it unwise to pursue riches and a position in the world in this system of things? (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) What work has Jehovah granted us a share in? (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) What activity do young people do well to consider pursuing? (Matt. 6:33) Why is a lifetime of serving Jehovah the best goal to have? (Eccl. 12:1) What help would we have in pursuing such a course? (Matt. 11:29, 30) Even though you still may be in school, what can you do during the summer to show your whole-souled desire to serve Jehovah? What kind of a schedule could you work up to auxiliary pioneer during the school vacation? (May interview one or two who auxiliary pioneered in past vacation period and did well.) Conclude by encouraging the youths to think about how they would answer these questions: How do you feel about the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Is it the religion of your family and therefore it is your religion? Or is it the best religion you have seen? Or is it the truth? If you really believe it is the truth, you should be motivated to offer yourself for its activities and its way of life.—Ps. 110:3; Heb. 6:10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Service to Subscribers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">Imagine a pile of magazines over 400 feet high. This would be equal to over 100,000 subscription copies of the magazines that became undeliverable as addressed. Last year the Society paid the postal service 25c each for these magazines, which totaled over $25,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The main reason for this was that subscribers moved and did not advise the Society of their new address in advance. Some were undeliverable due to inaccurate address information. What can we do to help reduce the number of undeliverable subscriptions?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. When we initially fill out a subscription slip, we should carefully verify the name and address. Double-check numbers in the address.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">2. Advise the Society as soon as a moving date is known. Send both old and new address to Watchtower, Wallkill, N.Y. 12589. When possible, include the old address portion of the subscription wrapper.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">3. When a subscription becomes undeliverable, the Society sends an Undeliverable Subscription Follow-up slip. The secretary should endeavor to obtain a new address and promptly send it. to the Society’s Wallkill office. We will then reinstate delivery to the corrected address. If the delivery address is correct and copies are not being received, . please return the Undeliverable Subscription Follow-up slip to the Society.

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1981 &quot;KINGDOM LOYALTY&quot; DISTRICT CONVENTIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">Psalm 145:10, 11 reminds us that ‘Jehovah’s loyal ones will bless him. About the glory of Jehovah’s kingship they will talk.’ As faithful servants of Jehovah, we are also loyal to his Kingdom government about which we talk as we share in preaching the good news and teaching people the truth. Our convention this summer will stress “Kingdom Loyalty” as its theme and will do much to aid us to keep on faithfully serving our Creator and working in the interests of his government. We will want to show appreciation for this arrangement to feed us spiritually by being present for the full program at whichever convention we plan to attend. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font0">for February provided information about securing accommodations. It also recommended which convention the brothers in each circuit should attend. The February 15 issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> listed the facilities that will be used this summer. We assume that by this time all have determined which convention they will attend and have started making the necessary preparations. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM: </span><span class="font0">The program is scheduled to begin on Thursday morning at 9:50 a.m. Plan to be present right from the start so as to benefit fully from the spiritual feast that has been arranged. The opening session on Thursday will emphasize things to which we all need to give attention. Also, while all convention sessions are important, be sure that you do not miss the Sunday morning program. You will do well to pay close attention to the information that will be presented. Our attitude toward going to and attending the convention should be that of David as expressed in Psalm 122:1: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’ ” It is vital that we listen closely to the entire program. (Luke 8:18-21) Do not unnecessarily save seats so that others are forced to spend time walking around looking for a place to sit. Each one should want to ‘work what is good to others related to us in the faith.’ (Gal. 6:10) While improvement has been noted, reports show that quite a number still inconsiderately save seats that are not used, while others are forced to look for seats or sit in less convenient locations. This does not show brotherly love for others, does it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT AT CONVENTION: </span><span class="font0">Whether we are able to share in the full-time service or not, we are all full-time Christians. As such we want to ‘be made new in the force actuating our minds, and put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.’ (Eph. 4:23, 24) Last year the vast majority of those in attendance manifested the new personality. One of the traveling overseers expressed appreciation for the good conduct in evidence at the convention he attended, stating: “It was noteworthy to see the orderliness of the brothers and their children, with very little milling around in the corridors.” Another brother commented: “The manners and courtesy of the brothers and sisters were certainly a praise and honor to our God. It was the best example I’ve seen in a long time at large assemblies. There was no crowding or shoving and the children were well behaved. The publishers were very courteous and mannerly in their driving habits. Our Bible students attended the convention with us and were very much impressed with what they saw and heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To get the most from the program we should be in our seats during the sessions and not milling around the corridors or outside the convention facility. While there has been improvement in this regard in recent years, the problem still persists to some degree. At one convention site last summer the report was made that “there was constant milling in the walkways. At one point the brothers measured the decibels of sound and more was coming from the restless people in the walkways than was coming from the sound system.” Does this not show a disrespect for Jehovah’s provision? One person who attended commented: “One day my children and I sat by a group of about ten young men and women old enough to know how to act at an assembly. They </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">were </span><span class="font0">constantly talking, laughing, eating, and [getting] up and down.” Such conduct is not loving or considerate, as it makes it difficult for others to concentrate on the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the days of Ezra “all the people” assembled, and as Ezra opened the book “all the people stood up.” At this assembly the Levites “were explaining the law to the people, while the people were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in a standing position.</span><span class="font0"> And they continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God.” (Neh. 8:5-8) Today we do not have to stand at our conventions. How thankful we are that arrangements are made well in advance so that there will be sufficient comfortable seating. We do well to take advantage of this provision by staying in our seats during the program, paying attention to what is being said, taking notes and following along in our Bibles. One parent wrote this experience to the Society: “My children and I sat by a mother and her four children. They were well behaved but ate continually throughout the whole session. It was very distracting to other adults and children sitting nearby. This family also drank a lot of liquids, which necessitated their making several trips to the restrooms.” Certainly we do not want to be going in and out or eating during the program and distracting others from giving their undivided attention to what is being said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At times, just outside of our assembly sites, apostates or others opposed to our work pass out literature or endeavor to engage us in conversation. How should such individuals be treated? We should not engage in verbal battles with opposers of the truth since a Christian is to be “gentle toward all, . . . keeping himself restrained under evil.” (2 Tim. 2:24) Some of these individuals may have been disfellowshiped in the past. They prove by their course of action that they are ‘pushing ahead and not remaining in the teaching of Christ.’ The apostle John advises us, “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. For he that says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.” (2 John 9-11) When such individuals realize they are not accomplishing their purpose of disturbing us, they are more likely to give up in their attempts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT IN CONVENTION CITY: </span><span class="font0">Jehovah’s Witnesses frequently return to the same convention cities year after year. Our gathering together in a spirit of true brotherhood and our personal conduct provide a fine witness that does not go unnoticed. A few years ago we received admonition about our conduct while staying at hotels/motels. The need to conduct ourselves as Christians at all times was stressed and the point was made that our actions reflect on the name of our Father, Jehovah. Many expressed appreciation for those straightforward remarks and, since then, favorable comments have been received indicating that those attending assemblies have endeavored to apply the counsel given. It is sad to note, however, that some reports still come in indicating that there are continuing problems. At some hotels/motels where our brothers stayed, there were complaints from other guests, who were not there for the convention, indicating that Witness children were playing on the elevators and otherwise interfering with elevator service as well as unnecessarily riding the escalators. Others had grievances related to children using swimming pools after closing time and demonstrating a lack of concern for non-Witness guests. Christian parents certainly will want to watch their children and be observant of any regulations relative to the use of swimming pools or other facilities at these hotels/motels. Would it not be good to discuss this matter as a family before leaving for the convention city?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The insert in the May 1980 issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font0"> provided good direction on the matter of tipping. It is nc$ against Christian principles to express appreciation in this way for personal services rendered by others. (Luke 10:7) Although this is a personal matter, to neglect doing so where it is expected may cast unfavorable reflections upon Jehovah’s people. To illustrate: The manager of a motel who cooperated with the convention personnel and arranged for many of our brothers and sisters to stay in his facility expressed concern over a problem that developed. The waitresses in his employ had told him that they did not want to wait on Jehovah’s Witnesses as they left no tips. On one occasion, a party of Jehovah’s Witnesses arrived just before the restaurant was to close. Arrangements were made for this group to sit together and be served, despite the fact that the workers had to stay after closing time to do so. It was reported that the only tip left was a copy of a pocket-size book that was released earlier that week at the convention. While so-called fast-food eating establishments do not provide waiter service and no tipping is involved, in restaurants where such service is provided it is left to the brothers to consider leaving a tip where this is the local custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FRIDAY AFTERNOON FIELD SERVICE: </span><span class="font0">Jesus commanded his followers to make disciples of others, sharing the good news that he had taught. (Matt. 28:19, 20) A fine opportunity to do this while attending the assembly is to participate in field service arrangements that will be scheduled on Friday afternoon. The program that day will conclude at 12:40 p.m. All in attendance should be able to get something to eat at the convention site and then be in field service well before 2 p.m. To save time it would be good to get organized for field service activity on Thursday. Perhaps you can arrange your groups with appointed servants taking the lead. Territory can be obtained on Thursday so that there should be no delay or confusion in getting out. While there has been good support for field service at past conventions, apparently some groups did not have enough territory. Therefore, when asking for territory, please indicate how many persons will be in your group and how long you wish to work. In this way you will be given sufficient territory and can have a full share in the preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The publishers should bring their own witnessing bag, a supply of the current magazines and a Bible. Further direction and printed material will be provided at the conventions that will assist us in giving a fine witness to people contacted in the convention cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many have expressed appreciation for the opportunity that the special field service arrangements afford to work in different territory and to share in service with friends from other congregations. One sister wrote: “I was happy to be among those who answered ‘aye’ to the resolution adopted at the convention. Later that day I went out into the service. Inside of 30 minutes I placed 18 magazines and passed out invitations to everyone who .walked by me as I stood on the street comer. I thank Jehovah for those spirit-arousing talks that motivated me to action.” The Friday morning program will highlight the importance of the field activity that afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font0">It was foretold that Jehovah’s people would offer themselves willingly in his service. (Ps. 110:3) This applies not only to our willingness to participate in the preaching and disciplemaking work but also to sharing in the work that must be done in order to make conventions a success. It is fine to see many helping out in this regard. Once again, the various departments needing help will take the initiative in inviting individuals in advance to assist. The local convention coordinator will be receiving from the convention some requests for volunteer workers needed. The Society’s new procedure for volunteer service means that no Application for Volunteer Service forms will be sent to the congregations. However, the convention will be sending some congregations </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> list of their personnel needs, and the convention coordinators will strive to fill such needs, if and when requested to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Any children 16 years of age or under must work together with a parent or another adult at all times. We encourage parents and their children to volunteer and work together, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font0">Food and drink will be provided similar to what was available for recent district conventions. We are very grateful for the efforts of the brothers and sisters who prepare the food at the conventions. There was fine cooperation last year at conventions where surplus food was sold after the conclusion of the Sunday program, and it may be that such surplus items will again be available at a few of the conventions. If that is the case, your cooperation will be appreciated again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The convention tickets in sheets worth $1 (10 tickets of 10c value) will be used for purchasing food and drink. The convention organization will make these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tickets </span><span class="font0">available to your congregation a few weeks ahead of the convention and you may purchase them then so as to save standing in line when you first arrive at the convention. It is suggested that you purchase enough food tickets in advance at your congregation to care for your needs for the first two or three days of the assembly. The tickets can be used for surplus food purchases also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">MUSIC: Special taped music for the interludes and audience singing is again planned by the Society. All are encouraged to join wholeheartedly in the singing, as this is an important part of the program and provides us with a fine opportunity to worship Jehovah, rendering praise and thanksgiving to him.—Eph. 5:18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions draw close, we look forward to benefiting from the fine spiritual provisions Jehovah has in store for us. The information provided herein will no doubt be of assistance to you in finalizing your plans to attend. All will want to consider carefully the direction given and endeavor to comply with the suggestions made, both individually and as families. May all of us work unitedly to make the 1981 “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions a success so that, as loyal servants of our Grand God, all who attend will be better equipped to talk about the glory of Jehovah’s kingship.—Ps. 145:10,11.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font11">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you find It necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the Special Needs arrangement you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer and camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font11">At most locations, the immersion will be on Saturday. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the 80 questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book with the elders prior to the convention. A bathing suit and towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font11">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be In our seats when the program begins. That will be at 9:50 a.m. on Thursday and Friday and at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. The same qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 4:50 p.m. on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service and so the sessions will conclude by 12:40 p.m. On Saturday the closing song and prayer are scheduled at 4:50 p.m., and on Sunday at 4:40 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">GILEAD AND BETHEL MEETINGS: </span><span class="font11">A meeting will be held on Thursday at 1:00 p.m. for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and would like to enter Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font11">AU </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font11"> pioneers as weU as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15.00 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates wiU be available to pioneers at the bookroom only upon showing their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card. Those in Bethel service may obtain any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates at the bookroom by showing their Bethel Identification card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font11">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font11"> the lapel card at the convention and also whUe traveling to and from the convention site. It has been observed in recent years that not as many as formerly are wearing a lapel card. Not only is the card a fine means of identification but It so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation. You wiU note that the lapel card has been designed in such a way that it may be used again for circuit assemblies untU next summer. The lapel cards are 1c each and the ceUuloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font11">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> times and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font11"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Meetings </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{Cant’d) </span><span class="font12">them on hand, the secretary may submit an order promptly. Do you carry handbills with you and, if possible, leave one in every home? Many experiences have been related in which individuals came in contact with the truth because of receiving a handbill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Follow through in assisting interested persons who attended the Memorial in April to continue coming to the Kingdom Hall. When new ones come, we are pleased. But what can we do to help them appreciate the need of meeting regularly with us? If they are going to grow spiritually, they need regular association with Jehovah’s people. Think back to the first time you attended the Kingdom Hall and recall what it was that impressed you. What made you want to come again? Was it not the friendliness of those who greeted you when ’ you entered? They took the initiative and got acquainted, making you feel at home. As you listened to their conversation, you may have realized that many had gone out of their way to bring others with them. They obviously were happy people who were interested in others and who loved one another. This made a lasting impression. Can we do more to greet new ones and make them feel welcome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Do you provide transportation for others? Usually interested persons are more apt to attend meetings if we make definite arrangements each week to stop by their home and provide transportation. One sister who is now serving at Brooklyn Bethel with her husband related that, when she was in her early teenage years, others in the congregation would regularly come by her home and provide transportation to the meetings. By the friends extending themselves she was especially encouraged to attend the congregation book study weekly, as well as other meetings. As she now looks back, she is thankful that others took a personal interest in her, helping her to get to the Kingdom Hall. Could we personally do more to assist others in this regard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW SERVANTS CAN ASSIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Elders and ministerial servants can do much to stimulate interest in local meetings and help publishers and family groups to support the congregation. Periodically they should visit the friends in their homes to offer encouragement. (1 Pet. 5:2) Could better arrangements be made to assist the sick and infirm to get to meetings?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivating Interest Through Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Paul wrote the Corinthians: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” (1 Cor. 3:6) To what was he referring?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Here Paul compares our preaching work to farming. We know that proper watering of newly planted seeds or of tender young developing plants is crucial for survival. Without such watering, seeds may not sprout and grow; plants may never blossom or produce fruit. True, whether we plant literal seeds or figurative seeds of truth, only Jehovah can give life or make things grow. However, in his wonderful arrangement, he invites us to plant Kingdom truths in the minds and hearts of people and to water them, thus granting us the honor of working with him in the spiritual harvest taking place today.—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO CULTIVATE AND WATER WITH RETURN VISITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Just as there are different methods of effectively cultivating and watering, there are various ways to make return visits. Wisely, when making return visits, we want to use the method that will cause the interest of the householder to grow. The following suggestions may be helpful to you in making return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Many say that (1) a sincere personal interest in the one being called on and (2) an appealing Bible subject to discuss have helped them in making return visits. With that in mind, they try to lay the groundwork for a return visit </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font12"> ending the first conversation with the householder. How could What about others who are spiritually weak or who are without transportation?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Interest can often be stimulated by “whetting the appetite” of the congregation. To illustrate: Post a list of the coming public talks on the information board. In addition, the subject and name of the speaker can be mentioned when making local announcements on the service meeting. Congregation book study conductors can keep the publishers informed as to future meeting parts, material that requires special preparation, and so forth. Are you appointed servants doing everything possible in this regard?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> All of us will want to have a full share in assisting others to get to meetings. This will result in more of our brothers being strengthened and encouraged.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">you do this? Consider the following examples: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> After describing the new system of things you could say: “How can we be sure that it will really come in our time? Perhaps I could stop by in a few days when the rest of the family is at home and show you the answer Jesus gave to that question.” Then when you return you may use information on pages 94 and 95 in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. Or you may say: “You may be wondering how being conscious of spiritual needs can make a person happy in our day. Perhaps the next time I call I can show you the Bible’s answer to the question.” You may review information in chapter 20 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font12"> book. As you can see, bringing up a subject or raising a question on your first call will pave the way for calling back on those who respond to the seeds of truth sown.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Of course, in order to follow up the subject you brought up with the householder, you will need to make notations on your house-to-house record of the subject you plan to discuss on your return visit. By making this a habit you will be better prepared to cultivate the interest you find.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> If you are having difficulty in making return visits, do not get discouraged. Experience in this field of activity comes with time. Feel free to ask your book study conductor for suggestions and help along these lines. Also, you may want to go along with a pioneer or publisher who does well in this work. The Topic for Conversation this month provides good opportunities for making return visits. Also, those who attended the Memorial could be called on with points from chapter 6 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font12">book. Perhaps you would like to try some of the suggestions in paragraph 5 of this' article to stimulate the interest of those who attended the Memorial.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A JOYFUL WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> The joy of seeing the fruit produced at harvesttime because of what one has planted is gratifying. To see an individual come into the truth brings even greater satisfaction. To watch a plant grow as we water and cultivate it is fascinating. To observe seeds of truth take root and grow in a person’s heart with the aid of our humble efforts is something in which we all can rejoice, knowing that we have the honor of working with Jehovah. May Jehovah bless our work in making return visits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Developing Magazine Routes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> While participating in the field service, we often find individuals who enjoy the magazines and will take them regularly but, for some reason, they do not want to subscribe. Some have personal objections to receiving magazines through the mail and having their name on a mailing list, but they are glad to receive the magazines on a regular basis when someone calls. Magazine routes can often be established with such individuals.—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book, pp. 117, 118.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How can we develop such magazine calls? First, we should endeavor to be out in service regularly each week. It is helpful to build a foundation for; our next call by offering to stop in a week or two to see if the householder enjoyed the magazines. Then we will want to record the necessary information on our house-to-house record, including the householder’s name, address, date of visit, issues placed and article or subject featured.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> On returning, you could say: “Good morning, [use householder’s personal name]. I have come to comment further on the article [mention article featured on previous call].” Whether the householder says he has read the article or not, you could then state: “In this current issue there is an interesting article on [refer to spe-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">worked territory. If your congregation has done so, have you planned to enjoy this special activity?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> With vacation from secular work or school in store for many during the summer months, it would be good to see if sharing in the auxiliary pioneer work can be included in plans for spiritual activity. Many have found that when they are able to have a greater share in field service and can follow up on all the interest found in the territory, they add much joy and satisfaction to their vacation. Having a full and enjoyable share in the service in such a way really can be “recreation,” for that means “refreshment of the strength and spirits after toil.” How refreshing it is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to be able to</span><span class="font12"> share the good news with others and to help them grow spiritually! Giving in such a way brings true happiness and lifts our spirits.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Now, before the summer ac-cific article]. As you recall, they are only 20c. I am sure that you will benefit greatly from them.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> There are advantages to having a magazine route. By calling regularly you get acquainted with people and can often build up a warm, friendly relationship. You have the opportunity to stimulate interest by leaving the current magazines for them to read and by your brief discussion each time you call. Once sufficient interest is kindled, you will find it is possible to start Bible studies witlvsome of those on your route; or, the individual or family called upon may see the advantages of having personal subscriptions to the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We encourage you to spend some time on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, developing and caring for such magazine route calls. Even young publishers will enjoy regularly bringing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines to interested persons. Keep in mind that each time you deliver the magazines, a return visit can be counted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> To establish a magazine route requires persistence. The results, however, are rewarding. Do you have a magazine route? If not, we encourage you to try the suggestions outlined above and to use to the full this way of dispensing spiritual food by means of the magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">tually starts, would be the time for us to plan as individuals and families for a spiritually rewarding vacation period. Planning helps us to get things done regularly and on time. Many have done very well in supporting field service arrangements on the first Sunday of the month because of advance planning. Can such activity be included in our summer plans too?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> May all of us conscientiously plan our spiritual activities now and in the months ahead, seeking Jehovah’s rich blessing on our united efforts to stay loyally in his service, as we talk about the glory of his kingship.—Ps. 145: 10, 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Night to Remember!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Keep doing this in remembrance of me”! (Luke 22:19) Once each year at the appropriate time Jesus’ disciples were to gather to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal, recalling as they did so his sacrifice, his pattern of life and his deep love for them. (1 Cor. 11:26; Matt. 11:28-30) Jehovah’s faithful people today still obey this command and so all who are physically able will assemble for this celebration after sundown, April 19, 1981.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> On that night we should each carefully examine our personal relationship with Jehovah and his Son. Has what they have done in providing the sacrifice drawn us closer to them? It should. (1 John 4:9, 10) Has our conduct over the past year demonstrated this? (1 John 5:3) If not, then serious thought should be given to developing a closer relationship with them, making whatever adjustments are necessary. Remembering Jesus’ course of integrity and his example will help us to do this. —Heb. 5:8.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION MEETINGS—PART V Benefiting from Public Talks</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Were you in attendance when the first organized series of public? talks, as we know them, began in January of 1945? There were only about 65,000 publishers in the United States in those days. Now, 36 years and 485,000 more publishers later, we can look back and say that the public talks have been of much benefit. They have definitely played their part in introducing many thousands of us to the truth and strengthening the faith of us all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps the ones who have benefited most from the public talks are the speakers themselves. Why so? When enlarging on the fine outlines provided them, they have had to research the Bible and the Society’s publications to make the talks instructive and interesting. Their research has broadened their understanding of the Scriptures and has caused their faith to be made more firm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In delivering their talks, the speakers endeavor to copy Jesus, the greatest public speaker of all times. He spoke with authority, also with kindness and love, so that the heart of the receptive hearers was moved to respond favorably. (Matt. 7:29) Even opposers said of him, “Never has another man spo</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> As we reflect on the significance of the occasion, how vital it is that we stay close to Jehovah through daily personal prayer, right conduct, field service and meeting attendance. Do not let this Memorial pass without meditation on Jehovah’s goodness, contemplating what can be done to draw even closer to him and strengthening our resolve to fulfill our dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ARRANGEMENTS FOR FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> We remember Jesus as a teller of the good news. By copying his example of preaching we can demonstrate our love for him. Well before the Lord’s Evening Meal, make full use of the special invitations printed for the occasion. If those you invite have never been to the Kingdom Hall, suggest that they attend meetings before Memorial so they can be acquainted with the location apd the people they will meet there. Too, it would be good to keep a record of all you</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ken like this.” (John 7:46) His talks were outstanding due to the fact that he expressed his Father’s thoughts and principles with simplicity, conviction and understanding. He motivated people to act. (Matt. 7:28; 22:46) He appealed to all segments of his audience— people young and old, from all walks of life—using illustrations that they understood. (Matt. 13: 3-9, 34, 35, 45-48) He aimed his message at the heart of his listeners, using penetrating questions to cause them to think, search their motives, arrive at their own conclusions and make decisions.—Matt. 16:5-16; 17:24-27; 26:52-54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When speakers deliver their well-researched material in a manner like Jesus, the audience cannot do otherwise than benefit. But how can the audience get the most out of the talk? It is important to pay attention to what is being said, not allowing one’s mind to wander. Looking up the scriptures and reading them along with the speaker is one way to stay alert. Some try to recall what the scripture states even before the speaker reads it. Taking a few notes helps too, because thereby one repeats on paper what was heard, making a double impression.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Considered Serving Jehovah as a Pioneer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How encouraging it is to observe the fine work being done by pioneers. “Zealous for fine works’’ is the apt description the apostle Paul gave of diligent workers in his day. (Titus 2:14) What about today? “There are not words to describe the joy I find in serving Jehovah as a pioneer,” replies one sister. Can you, too, experience such feelings about your sacred service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">.<sup>2</sup> One of the first steps toward pioneering is to work at developing the pioneer spirit. What is that? As we learned at the last series of circuit assemblies, it is a right attitude or disposition toward the command to preach. It involves an interest in people. It is a spirit of joy in doing the will of God in these last days. While some are devoted to maintaining a certain standard of living, those with the pioneer spirit are willing to make sacrifices in order to spend more time in assisting people. (Matt. 13:45, 46) Do only the pioneers have the pioneer spirit? No. Many have this spirit though their circumstances may not allow them to pioneer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup> How can you determine if pioneering is possible in your circum-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Night to Remember </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">invite so that you can call back after Memorial to help them regularly attend the meetings and study the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If you are not able to share in visiting people in their home, could you call them on the telephone or write letters inviting them to attend? Why not make it a goal to invite at least two other persons besides those with whom you study the Bible? What about unbelieving family members, neighbors, or those with whom you work? As you explain to each one the importance of the occasion and why it is such a sacred night to Jehovah’s Witnesses, you will build up their understanding and strengthen your own appreciation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The service overseer will make arrangements for special field service activity on the day of the Memorial. There will be no other meetings that day. (See Announcements.) Special attention will be given to making return visits on any who have expressed interest. Since the Memorial falls on Sunday when most people are free to attend, it should be possible to aid many more than usual to come to this most important meeting. As you speak with them, you will find helpful information in the article “Celebrating the Death of the stances? Likely there are some in your congregation who are or have been pioneers. Why not talk to them about it? They will be glad to give you helpful suggestions on how to arrange a workable schedule. (Eph. 5:16) One must learn to balance personal study and family responsibilities with field service. Time is needed to care for material needs and this may require secular employment. So the right use of funds enters the picture. If you keep things simple and put the interests of God’s kingdom first, you will be imitating Jesus Christ and will find happiness in the pioneer service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Suppose you find pioneering financially possible, but you are not sure your health will hold up or whether you can arrange a workable schedule? Why not try auxiliary pioneering for a few months while you work things out? If successful, then by all means consider pioneering for at least a year. This will give you an opportunity to see now your health, schedule, and so forth, work out over a longer period of time. No doubt once you have tasted the joys of pioneering you will not want to stop; but if it does not work out for you, at least you will have had a fine year of rich blessings in the full-time service that you will treasure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Do you have a problem getting someone to work with you? Encouraging others to share in the auxiliary or regular pioneer work can often be the means of finding a pioneer partner. By taking the initiative and letting others Know that you will be glad to work with them, they are often moved to try it. An invitation with a brief</span></p></li></ul>

If there is time, show new ones around the Hall. Introduce them to others. Be alert for the opportunity to arrange for a Bible study. The brother giving the talk can especially make all glad they came by appealing to their heart with a clear, understandable talk, warmly delivered.</span></p></li>

After a recent talk a sister said, “At last I see why it is so important for me to be more kind and thoughtful in dealing with my family.” What the speaker said reached the heart and changes were made. This emphasizes the benefit of repetition of Scriptural counsel from week to week.—John 13:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT BENEFITS LIE AHEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> In March we will be starting a new series of 60 public talks. We can look forward to hearing such subjects as “Bearing Up Under Persecution,” “What Is Behind the Spirit of Rebellion?” and “Is the Truth Transforming Your Life?” While some of the talk titles may sound familiar, the outlines have been brought up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Those who are assigned these new talks will want to prepare well so that the material used will be informative and practical. Speakers should be enthusiastic, endeavoring to teach, encourage and motivate others. Their talks should be just 45 minutes in length. All of us will want to attend and benefit from these public talks, demonstrating that we fully appreciate being taught by Jehovah.—John 6:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">us have uppermost in our minds maintaining integrity to Jehovah. In this we will copy Jesus. Let us, too, whether of the anointed or other sheep, manifest our unity with one another in pure worship. By our united, integrity-keeping course we will show that we are truly remembering the significance of that night.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Topic for Conversation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember how happy you were when you learned of God’s purposes for the earth and mankind? This happiness led to your being conscious of your spiritual need and moved you to act upon it. As we speak to people at the doors we can help them to realize the same happiness. During the next few months we will be using Matthew 5:3 and Revelation 1:3 to help people become aware of what makes for happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In March we will be offering one of the older 192-page books. April and May will find us in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> subscription campaign. Whatever publication you may be offering, your conversation could begin with Matthew 5:3. After introducing yourself you might say: “What do you think it would take for people to be happy? [Allow for response, and acknowledge what was said.] Jesus made some observations on what would make us happy in his Sermon on the Mount.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneering &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">word of encouragement from you may be all it takes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When can you begin sharing in this special work? What about the month of April? The weather will be getting warmer, and what better way could one enjoy the beauty of springtime than in the pioneer service? If you are planning a family vacation later on, could you arrange to auxiliary pioneer in unassigned territory or with a congregation that needs help in covering its territory? Those who have done so in the past have found this can produce many happy memories.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> In looking back over his 25 years of regular pioneer service, a brother wrote to the Society: “All in all, they leave good and happy memories with the feeling of some accomplishment, some discipline and some sacrifices. However, what we gain in return well offsets what we may have given up. —Mark 10:29, 30.” Seven months later this brother passed away while still pioneering. What a fine example of the pioneer spirit! Can you share his feeling? Whether you are able to be a regular or an auxiliary pioneer, or even if circumstances do not permit you to do either, if you are “zealous for fine works,” such fond memories of accomplishment can be yours.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">At Matthew 5:3 he outlined a key factor that is needed. [Read.] Why did Jesus say that being conscious of our spiritual need would make us happy? Because it moves us to learn more about what God’s purpose is for mankind. The principles and laws outlined in the Bible are for our eternal good.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> At this point you may offer the publication or continue by saying, “At Revelation 1:3 Jesus said that persons would be happy if they ‘observed the things written’ in God’s Word. To help you understand the Bible and how it applies to you personally, we are offering this publication.” Then present offer, drawing attention to specific points that will help householder to see the value of the publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> If you are speaking tq a Jewish person, Psalm 119:2 could be used to show the importance of being aware of spiritual needs. Then reference may be made to Isaiah 25:8 or 33:24 to show the promises God has made of earthly blessings for those who do his will.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The above approach, combined with a sincere desire to help people to become conscious of their spiritual need, could very well direct honest-hearted ones you meet toward the provisions Jehovah has made for their salvation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• What should be done with Bible study reports after the secretary has compiled the monthly field service report?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The secretary should keep the Bible study reports In his regular file box for two months; thereafter, the study reports can be given to the congregation book study conductors who may find them helpful in giving encouragement and personal assistance to those publishers who are conducting home Bible studies. Help may be given to the persons who are studying as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Book study conductors should strive to get acquainted with the Interested persons and encourage them to associate with the local book study group, if at all possible. The book study conductor can speak encouragingly with the brothers and sisters about their home Bible studies, perhaps taking advantage of time before or after regular congregation meetings to do so. He may be able to arrange to accompany some of the publishers on their home Bible studies and offer spiritual encouragement in that way. Also the service overseer can give encouragement regarding the home Bible study work when he visits the congregation book study group, using information provided on the home Bible study report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The secretary’s file of Bible study reports should be available to the circuit overseer when he visits the congregation. He may also be able to accompany some of the publishers when</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC NEWS </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Italy reports that no Witnesses lost their lives in the recent earthquake that hit the southern part of that country, although over 8,000 publishers lived in the affected area. Brothers provided relief for 'all who suffered losses. In one town many lost their homes, but all were attending the Kingdom Hall at the time and were safe since it was not damaged. ♦ El Salvador reported an 18-percent increase in November with a new peak of 8,034 publishers in spite of difficulties in the country. Publishers averaged 12.9 hours and one study each during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ New peaks of publishers were reported for November by many branches including Alaska, Australia, Austria, Bolivia, Finland, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Martinique, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. </span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Tract to Use with “Happiness&quot; Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You will have an exciting new item to use with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness </span><span class="font13">book during June and July. It is a colorful new tract, “Is a Happy Life Really Possible?” The tract will be printed with four colors, so it will readily catch attention. It is designed to move persons to have discussions, or a Bible study, using the new </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font13"> book. We are confident that the tract will be very effective. You will feel the same when you see it and use it in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Congregations should quickly determine their needs for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">two </span><span class="font13">months. Order in lots of 1,000, or multiples thereof, using the S-14 Literature Order Blank. The charge will be $3.50 per 1,000 tracts.

<p><span class="font12">they conduct their home Bible studies. This should prove to be especially encouraging to the student and helpful to the one conducting the study. Or the circuit overseer may be able to visit some of these Interested persons at other times during his visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Whenever a Bible study is discontinued, this should be noted on the Bible study report slip, indicating the reason. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review the Bible study reports. It may be that some that have discontinued their studies can be helped to a greater appreciation of their spiritual needs. How fine it would be If some discontinued studies could be resumed and the individuals aided spiritually once more!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of us are very much Interested in the disciple-making work and will want to take advantage of every opportunity to encourage and help those new ones who are coming to a knowledge of the truth. The home Bible study reports can help. The congregation book study conductor can discard the older report slips month by month as he receives newer ones from the secretary.</span></p>

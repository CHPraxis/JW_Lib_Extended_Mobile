<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How thankful we all are for Jehovah's rich blessings upon our efforts during the 1981 service year! On April 19, 1981, we had the highest number ever to attend a Memorial celebration in this country. Then, during the summer months 1,057,237 attended the district conventions in the United States. This was another peak figure. And now, to close out the 1981 service year, a new all-time peak of 588,503 publishers was reached. This is 11,134 more than the previous publisher peak back in November of 1975. Let us continue moving forward as loyal Kingdom proclaimed, praying that the Word of God will keep on growing in its powerful influence on our lives and that the number of new disciples will keep on multiplying.—Acts 6:7.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Zealous in Spreading Life-giving Knowledge</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">} “Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah.” Thus spoke Jehu to Jonadab when carrying out his commission from Jehovah. (2 Ki. 10:16, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version)</span><span class="font1"> Today, also, many have noted the zeal of Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> One modern historian stated: “Jehovah’s Witnesses have literally covered the earth with their witnessing. ... It may be truly said that no single religious group in the world displayed more zeal and persistence in the attempt to spread the good news of the Kingdom.” Others have said: “We admire their zeal.” Yes, true Christianity is marked by zeal. That is why Jehovah’s Witnesses are so active in spreading lifegiving knowledge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Zeal is defined as intense eagerness or ardent interest in pursuit of something. Some synonyms are: enthusiasm, intensity, willingness and fervor. Where there is zeal there is life, vibrance. Spiritual</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Decorum as a Christian</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> We are “a theatrical spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men,” stated the apostle Paul. (1 Cor. 4:9) As Jehovah’s Witnesses we consider it a privilege to represent our Father, Jehovah, in a clean and modest way. We know that our conduct, speech, grooming and clothing styles all can influence others as to how they view the true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Christians are expected to maintain proper decorum. Our conduct, grooming and dress at all times should reflect the decency and dignity that befits dedicated servants of God. It certainly would not be fitting for Christians to be immodest or inconsiderate of others.—Mic. 6: 8; 1 Cor. 10:31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> When others view us, what do zeal includes having genuine love for God and neighbor. (Mark 12: 29-31) It is contagious and stirs one up to a godly ministry. “Exert yourselves vigorously,” exhorts Jesus. “Do not loiter at your business,” echoes Paul, reminding us of the urgency of our preaching activity. Let all of us, therefore, participate zealously in spreading the life-giving knowledge of truth. —Luke 13:24; Rom. 12:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SPREADING LIFE-GIVING KNOWLEDGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">* What a joy it is to help someone come to know and serve Jehovah! Our magazines are an aid to that end. Our zeal should move us to make time to declare the “good news.” During November, we can show zeal by presenting the subscription for both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font1"> just as we did in October. To serve Jehovah with faithfulness and zeal involves work, but if we have appreciation for the increasing ur-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3) </span><span class="font1">they see? Does our dress bespeak a lack of modesty? Could our dress and grooming be viewed as suggestive or provocative? Would others be distracted or offended by our appearance, bearing or manner? According to reports received, this has actually happened. Many of you brothers have expressed particular appreciation for comments that were made at the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions last summer regarding proper Christian conduct, dress and grooming.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> One of the talks, you will recall, stated very forcefully: “Why any servant of Jehovah </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God should </span><span class="font1">want to imitate the styles that characterize the immoral, rebellious elements of the Devil’s world is difficult to understand. Why try</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">The new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let 'Your Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font1"> will provide the basis for five special talks to be given in the congregations during January. Although many of the brothers will have already read the new book through by that time, these animated discussions should not only cultivate a deeper ap-&amp;reciation for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come” </span><span class="font1">ook on the part of all the brothers, but also will be encouraging to newly interested ones who perhaps have not taken the time personally to read the book through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since there will be five Sundays this January, most congregations should be able to arrange to present the five talks during this one month. Of course, if it should be necessary for some congregations to exchange speakers, they can stagger the beginning of the series, which would mean that some congregations will begin the series on January 10 and end on February 7. Also, those congregations attending a circuit assembly or having the visit of the circuit overseer during January will need to make appropriate adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is the only notice that will be given regarding this series of special talks. We encourage the elders to act immediately in making necessary arrangements so that the assigned speakers will have sufficient time to prepare well so as to present the material in a fine way. Only qualified speakers should be selected to give these talks. In some cases ministerial servants could be used, if there is a need and they are capable speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The titles of the five talks are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1—“What God’s Kingdom Means for Our Earth” (Chap- 1-4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2—“The Messianic King of God’s Kingdom” (Chap. 5-8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3—“Kingdom Servants Conquer by Their Faith” (Chap. 9-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4—“The ‘Last Days’ and God’s Kingdom—Now!” (Chap. 1214)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5—“Rewards for Loyally Advocating God’s Kingdom” (Chap. 15-18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No outlines will be provided for these talks, but the speakers will want to stick closely to the material presented in the assigned chapters of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come” </span><span class="font1">book. A speaker may wish to refer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> specific points in the book during his presentation and may include the audience to some ^extent in the discussion. However, the information should be presented</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Remember Those Who Are Taking the Lead”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Loyal and active supporters of Christianity highly prize the faithful work and zealous lead of the elders in the congregations. It is a pleasure to cooperate closely with them as they seek to advance Kingdom interests. We cannot help but reflect appreciatively on their exemplary service over the years and as a result, strive to imitate their faith, devotion, love and endurance. When we consider their earnest and industrious service, it should prompt an eagerness in us to obey and submit to those ‘governing us’ who may be ‘losing sleep over our souls.’ (2 Tim. 3: 10, 11; Heb. 13:7, 17, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Interlinear Translation.)</span><span class="font1"> Ministerial servants, as they work closely under the supervision of the elders, may also serve as wholesome examples to others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ELDERS AND MINISTERIAL SERVANTS AS EXAMPLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> What a challenge it can be for elders to balance their secular and family responsibilities with theocratic pursuits!' The diligent application of Bible principles in their lives, aided by Jehovah’s spirit, has enabled them to care for themselves and their families while scheduling time to assist others. Regularly they work in the field ministry, arrange for and conduct weekly congregational meetings, serve as counselors and visit those related to them in the faith. As they use their initiative in handling this trust, they work for the protection and blessing of the congregation.—Isa. 32:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> As undershepherds, the elders seek to imitate the attitude and ways of our Exemplar, Jesus. Unlike the hypocritical religious leaders of his day, Jesus was a sterling example of zeal for true worship. He showed such zeal not just with talk but by demonstrating a willingness to set the pace in performance. Like Jesus, the elders extend themselves in sacred service and maintain a reasonable view of what is expected of others. —1 Pet. 5:2, 3; Matt. 11:28-30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">* Ministerial servants should likewise be examples of zeal to the basically as a discourse and should not be merely a summary nor given as a book review. A week before these talks commence, all in the congregation should be reminded to bring their personal copies of the book to these meetings. Please see what was stated in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font1"> for November 1980 regarding the special series of talks given on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font1"> book.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">congregation. As they share in all features of the field ministry and discharge other responsibilities, they ‘acquire for themselves a fine standing’ in the congregation. (1 Tim. 3:13) As they reach Sut and become more zealous, they ray, in time, be assigned to handle additional responsibilities. This may include handling service meeting parts, giving public talks or conducting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> congregation book study. Wnat a fine contribution they make to the growth and stability of the congregation as they learn to carry out their assignments with reliance on Jehovah and his holy spirit!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> How can we demonstrate our appreciation for the elders’ loving oversight? One way is by taking advantage of opportunities to cooperate with those taking the lead. Our being mindful of their weighty responsibilities should stir us to respect them and obediently submit to their direction. When we display proper regard for our hardworking elders, we contribute to our joy and theirs, while strengthening the spirit of our congregational family.—1 Thess. 5:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> Another way to demonstrate your appreciation is to take the initiative in asking to work along with these brothers, and the ministerial servants, in field service. The first Sunday of the month or the second and fourth Saturdays would be a fine time to do so. Your sharing with them weekly in the preaching and disciplemaking work will be a source of encouragement to them and will result in refreshment for yourself. —Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> What a privilege we have to be active Christian associates, carrying out our God-assigned work! As we work hard to share in vindicating Jehovah’s name, we should use our talents, gifts and energies in a worthwhile way. Elders and ministerial servants should earnestly endeavor to care for their respective responsibilities in an exemplary manner. By imitating those who take the lead, the congregation will be united in reflecting their activity, love and concern. —Phil. 3:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Boldness</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom message is unique. Thus, at appropriate times, the circumstances in which we preach require boldness. Evidently with this in mind the apostle Paul made frequent reference to the need for bold persistence in speaking the Word of God. (Eph. 6:1820; 1 Thess. 2:2) Like first-century witnesses, we must not allow apathy, fear of men or opposition to cause us to become timid or hesitant in presenting Kingdom truths.—Acts 4:29-31; 28:30, 31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERCOMING OBSTACLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> At times it may seem difficult or inconvenient to reach a certain home or individual with our message. Will we boldly persist? While out in the door-to-door work, a sister asked a woman whether anyone was living in a certain downstairs apartment since she had never located anyone there before. The woman tried to dissuade the sister from calling at the apartment, stating that the man who lived there was busy. Our sister tactfully persisted and was able to speak with the young man who lived there. He had never talked with Witnesses before and readily agreed to study with a brother in the congregation. Before long, he was attending meetings and participating in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Being bold does not mean being rude, self-reliant or presumptuous. It does involve determination and tactful persistence so as to take advantage of every appropriate occasion to preach. When we are motivated by a genuine love of God and neighbor, we can speak the truth with boldness.—Acts 26: 24-26.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCCASIONS FOR SHOWING BOLDNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Are you hesitant about making return visits, perhaps fearing that you will be turned away? That is how one couple felt, even though they had located a young woman who expressed interest in the Bible’s message. However, at a congregation meeting, they received encouragement to follow up interest and therefore decided to call back. Imagine their joy when this woman welcomed them and informed them that she and her neighbor had been studying the Bible on their own. They had prayed to God for help and in a matter of days had received the first visit from this couple. The two women eagerly accepted a Bible study and made excellent progress. How happy this Witness couple must be that they took courage and returned!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>s</sup> The conditions under which we preach the “good news” will not always be favorable or easy. But when confronted with indifference or outright ridicule because of our stand for the truth, we will need to speak up with boldness, yet doing so with mildness and deep respect. (1 Pet. 3:15) This will honor Jehovah’s name and may work for the salvation of honest-hearted ones who listen, see that they also listen and learn. Where they sit during the meetings may have a bearing on how they listen and whether they learn or not. Are they sitting with those who will help them concentrate on the meetings? During meetings is not a time to be eating or playing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> It is good for elders and ministerial servants to set a good example by being seated and listening rather than caring for some responsibility during the meeting. In our field ministry, conduct, appearance and bearing, let us all apply Christian principles, doing all things out of love for God, Christ Jesus and our brothers. This will be in line with the words of Paul, who said he wrote certain things “that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.” —1 Tim. 3:14, 15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Over 1,500 brothers and. sisters from Paraguay were able to attend the “Kingdom Loyalty&quot; convention in o nearby country. They were greatly encouraged to continue their service, although the work is banned in Paraguay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">$ District conventions in the Caribbean were well supported with 7,640 attending in Guadeloupe, 2,290 in the Netherlands Antilles and 31,886 at the three conventions in Puerto Rico.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">gency to spread life-giving knowledge, we will show zeal by sharing in field service to the extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STIR OTHERS TO ZEALOUS WORKS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Despite colder weather in much of the country in November, zeal should impel us to be out in the field, preaching in our territory. (Jer. 20:9) Could you take full advantage of the congregation’s arrangements for group witnessing? What about planning to go out at other times as well? Talk over your schedule with others and encourage them to work with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> In view of these critical times and the urgent message we bear, there is a need for us to “be aglow with the spirit” as we encourage others to become acquainted with God and his Word. By zealously spreading the life-giving knowledge published in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> and inviting others to subscribe to them, we give evidence of our own appreciation for the vital information they contain. Remember that these are the most widely circulated religious magazines in the world. Certainly they are the most beneficial ones published. So we have good reason to be zealous and enthusiastic about offering the subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Ask yourself: “Am I zealous for fine works? Can my support of the preaching activity be described as ardent, whole-souled?” Your answers will tell you much about the intensity of your zeal. The more we share in spreading life-giving knowledge, the greater will be the number of those who see that we are truly a people “zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">» Some may have problems with being on time for congregation meetings. Of course, it is understandable that at times unavoidable circumstances may be encountered. But love for the truth and for our brothers will move us to come early, when at all possible, so as to benefit from wholesome Christian fellowship. Often it is simply a matter of good planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LISTEN AND LEARN</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> Individually we have a responsibility to listen and learn. (Luke 8:18) We want to get the most out of the meetings, since the information is coming from the ‘faithful slave’ and is for our spiritual feeding and benefit.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The second of the two greatest commandments given by God to mankind is: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22: 39) Jehovah God was the first one to exhibit deep and abiding love for mankind. His Son, Jesus, likewise showed love for the human family by the sacrifice of his life as a ransom in our behalf. This was a display by' Jesus of the deepest meaning of love for one’s neighbor. (John 3:16; 15:13) But Jesus did other things as well to show his love for mankind. What else did he do?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> For one thing, Jesus preached the good news of God’s kingdom that would bring eternal blessings to obedient mankind. His deep</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASED FIELD SERVICE ACTIVITY DURING APRIL RESULTS IN ANOTHER EXCELLENT REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We have good reason to be thankful to Jehovah for his rich blessings this past April. Here in the United States the field service report gives solid evidence of keen appreciation for the Kingdom ministry entrusted to us. The April report shows we had our best month this service year as far as total hours, magazines, subscriptions, return visits and home Bible studies are concerned. In fact, it was one of the best months in a number of years. While the total publishers is not a new peak for this service year, it is still 20,081 more than April a year ago, a 4.4-percent increase over last year's average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The 41,887 auxiliary pioneers plus the number of regular and special pioneers shows that 61,199, or 10.8 percent of the total publishers shared in full-time field service during April. This is commendable. We feel coqfident that all who shared in this privilege experienced much’joy. So did the congregation publishers who put forth added effort in the ministry during that month. Let us keep on glorifying our ministry, doing our utmost to make known the marvelous Kingdom hope to all who will hear.—Rom. 11:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Training Our Children to Be Preachers off the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Due to the fine witness given by two Christian boys concerning their faith and convictions, the parents of these youths received a letter, which said in part: “I am still under the charm of the long conversation I had this morning with your two children. . . . Truly, I never remember having heard children express their faith so interestingly and with so much conviction and intelligence. . . . I do not know you, but judging by your two children, you must be praiseworthy parents.” Even more than a credit to their parents, these children are truly a credit to Jehovah whose righteous principles have become a guiding influence in their lives.—Ps. 148: 12, 13; Matt. 21:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Certainly all Christian parents want their children to grow up to be whole-souled, dedicated serfeelings for people are shown by a Biblical account dealing with one of his preaching tours. We read at Matthew 9:35, 36: “And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching . . . and preaching the good news of the kingdom . . . On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” The account also tells us that he performed acts of healing as an evidence of his love for people. Yes, indeed, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus care for others, and their display of love is unmatched. Can we likewise </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font2">vants of Jehovah. (Prov. 23:24, 25) However, we know that just being a part of a Christian household does not automatically make youths praisers of Jehovah. Parents should not assume that attainment of the goal is a matter of chance. The experience related above well illustrates that we can train our children to be preachers of the good news. However, diligent and consistent effort is important.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESSIVELY TRAIN YOUR CHILDREN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Jesus trained his disciples progressively to be preachers of the good news. First he explained their objective. (Matt. 4:19) Then he took them with him, preaching to and teaching the people. Thus, the disciples were trained in service. In time he sent them out by twos </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font2"> 1)</span></p></li></ul>

In discussing paragraphs 5 and 6, if there have been some good experiences in placing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font2"> book, include them. Then lead into the part that follows on using the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font2"> book tract in field service to start home Bible studies.</span></p>

Point out sections in the book that prove appealing to people who show interest in Bible study. Many today face economic problems dealing with inflation and unemployment. Demonstrate briefly how chapter 6, “Money Problems— What Help?” might be used to encourage home Bible study. Page 61, subheading “Being Content Is a Key” might well be used.</span></p>

For example, page 40, paragraph 25, shows how a start can be made to take on this responsibility of sharing the good news. The need for association with fellow believers is stressed on page 50, paragraph 24. Getting to know what the Bible student thinks is important. Pages 34 and 35 illustrate ways this can be done, showing how you can teach him to express himself on what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span class="font2">thinks. As student approaches time when dedication and baptism should be considered, page 183 can be discussed in detail. Highlight throughout the need to make progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE SHOULD DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> We can share with others the good news of that same kingdom that Jesus preached. (Matt. 10: 5-7) Jesus also said in the prophetic twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew that part of the sign marking the end of this wicked world would be the earth-wide preaching of the good news of the Kingdom for a witness. In these highly significant “last days,” it is our privilege to be Kingdom proclaimed, giving evidence of our genuine love for our neighbors as for ourselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> As we share in such important work we have great inner joy and peace of mind. We are confident in heart and mind that we are doing just as Jesus and his early disciples did, spreading Kingdom good news to those who are ‘skinned and knocked about as sheep without a shepherd,’ giving evidence of dur love for our neighbor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Parents!—‘Following the example of Jesus, progressively train your children. Teach them </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font2"> we preach, and the objectives of the various methods and features of our ministry. Also, take the time to help them appreciate the meaning of the various responses encountered. Train them to do the work by setting goals for them and helping them to attain each goal. Passing out handbills, reading scriptures for you and keeping the house-to-house records may be simple objectives with which to begin their training. Later, they should learn some effective ways to introduce the message and how to converse with householders.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FINE RESULTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> There are many fine examples of faithful brothers and sisters among us who were taught from youth on to be disciples of Christ, preachers of the good news. In congregations everywhere they continue to serve, some as pioneers and appointed servants. How thankful they are that, from an early age, they had impressed upon them the importance of the field ministry.—Eccl. 11:9, 10; 12:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> All of us in the congregations of Jehovah’s people have an interest in training our children to be preachers of the good news. To the extent that other members of the congregation are moved to volunteer to help parents with some aspect of training their children in the field service, parents may accept this help. However, Jehovah God has placed the responsibility of training children in the hands of the parents. Therefore, parents, train your children to be preachers of the good news!</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">2. What subjects interest householders in our territory?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">3. How do you introduce yourself and get into the Topic for Conversation?</span></p>
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> ‘If only I had more time to study. I just can’t seem to find the time!’ Have you heard anyone make.this statement? Perhaps you have made it yourself. Do you find it difficult to set aside time for personal study? Does it seem sometimes that other things interfere with your personal and family study? Yes, it takes real effort to set aside sufficient time for studying. Obviously, there are many activities that can consume our time. On the other hand, our own sinful flesh can cause us to put off personal study. (Compare Romans 7:18-20.) If you have experienced difficulties in this regard, what can you do to improve your study habits? First, ask yourself: How important is personal study to me? Can I do more than I am doing presently? Where will I find the needed time? Do I have a good arrangement for study? If you do, fine! But if not, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font2"> is the time to develop a good schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Additionally, think about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">why </span><span class="font2">it is so important to do personal study. Is it enough to try to get by with only what you can absorb at the meetings, without doing personal study? In time your spiritual health will reflect your neglect. To grow spiritually we have to put forth diligent personal effort. If we have a tendency to neglect personal study, we would do well to reflect upon the need for accurate knowledge in order to have Jehovah’s approval.—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHEDULING PERSONAL STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Plan definite times for personal study. Establish a schedule that will fit your particular life pattern. Perhaps you can spend 10 to 15 minutes each day studying or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Love Your Neighbor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Conf d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">share in the preaching work. Also, you may be able to share the good news with others when fueling your car, getting groceries, eating at a restaurant, riding on public transportation, and so forth. And do not forget to make use of the tract that encourages, home Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> By being alert to opportunities you can express your love for your neighbor. We encourage you to pay close attention to the service meeting parts during July dealing with the use of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness </span><span class="font2">book in witnessing so that you will be prepared to pass along the good information in that publication. Thus we may lead others to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font2">Word of God, the source of information on how we can love our neighbor as ourselves.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have a Good Personal Study Program?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">reading the Bible. Some persons do this early in the morning, or before going to bed at night. Others take advantage of time spent while riding on public transportation, waiting for an appointment or during lunch breaks. If you incorporate some of these suggestions in your schedule for personal study, you may be delighted at how much you can accomplish in just a few minutes every day. Of course, once the schedule is made, you should stick to it. If you fail to maintain a good schedule for personal study, your efforts are likely to be too haphazard to be successful. So, strive to prevent anything from interfering with your personal study arrangements. Our rate of spiritual growth, to a large extent, is governed by the regularity and the quality of our personal study. —Ps. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS OF PERSONAL STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> At Proverbs 2:1-5 we are counseled to “find the very knowledge of God.” We can never hope to acquire the “knowledge of God” unless we study his Word. By personal study we impress more deeply upon our minds and hearts Scriptural material designed to draw us closer to Jehovah. We can more readily note details and check specifics of the material discussed at meetings if we have considered it privately, beforehand. By using good study methods we will find that our reading ability will improve, as well as our grammar and choice of words. We will give better talks and be more upbuilding in our comments at meetings and home Bible studies. We will learn more and remember more, as Jehovah’s Word is sounded down into our minds and hearts. This will help us to be better equipped to make decisions when faced with important issues. Our shield of faith can then offer greater protection from this world’s wicked influences. Yes, the more we learn, the better prepared we will be to give others the reasons for our Kingdom hope.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Life-giving knowledge comes from God, but it is not acquired or retained without considerable personal effort. A positive attitude will go a long way toward helping us to gain accurate knowledge. (Col. 3:10) Personal study plays a vital part in growth to maturity and in keeping ourselves strong spiritually and properly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">equipped </span><span class="font2">for Jehovah’s service. Be willing to ‘pay the price’ of time ana effort in studying God’s Word. It surely is worth it!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Most of us will participate in magazine-day activity by offering </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> from house to house. This generally is where we find many persons in a position to listen. But even here we do well to be brief, holding our presentations to just enough time to stimulate interest. The objective is to place the magazines and let them do the “talking.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> If we were not out in service on magazine day, likely we would be busy just as the people on whom we call, so we should take this into consideration. Because the weekends are the only time many people have to care for matters around the home, we should anticipate their objection: “I’m busy.” Therefore, some publishers find it beneficial to comment on this in their brief introduction, saying: “I am a local minister [or neighbor] calling on this busy Saturday morning. . . .” Quickly they get into pointed comments that tie in with a preselected article and show how the information in the article can benefit the householder personally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Another objection that may come up initially is: “I’m not interested in Jehovah’s Witnesses or those magazines.” To this some publishers reply: “I can understand why you may feel that way; however, I’m quite sure you are interested in information that would help you to get a good night’s rest,” or whatever topic you may be featuring in the magazines. At times, this response captures the interest of the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> “By far we place more magazines per hour by working from store to store,” wrote one circuit overseer’s wife. Other publishers will concur. One brother who enjoys fine success in this activity explains how he does it: “I give my name, state that I am a minister and that I am calling on business people in the area. I say: *1 know that you are busy so I will be very brief.’ Then I mention the subject I am discussing and state a point on it in a sentence or two. I then take the magazines out of my briefcase, show the particular article on the subject and make the offer.” If the. manager shows interest, you may ask permission to make a similar brief offer to the employees.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> For some publishers, offering irtagazines on the street has proved especially effective. They usually do not stand in one spot. “I move slowly with the crowd, one brother explained. “I may say to a man: ‘I beg your pardon,’ and then go on with my presentation.” The idea is to take the initiative and appr</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">oach people.</span><span class="font2">___</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PERFORMING A PUBLIC SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> When a new magazine arrives, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">analyze</span><span class="font2"> its appeal. You may have a neighbor or friend who has not been especially responsive to the truth, but who is interested in a particular subject. When this is discussed in the magazines, you may be able to place them with him. Also, when an article deals with the police department or law enforcement, see to it that the policemen and judges in town receive a copy. Appropriate articles on the medical profession can be directed to those most interested in that subject. Or, if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> discusses automobiles or auto maintenance, feature it at gas stations, used car agencies and so forth. By taking advantage of these many possibilities, we perform a valuable </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">public service</span><span class="font2">-------—---<sub>7</sub></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Not to be overlooked, too, are our special issues. Many publishers have noted that they have wide appeal and are easily placed. Extra copies may be ordered and used for several months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Magazine-day witnessing is one of the easiest and most enjoyable ways to share in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) Make it your aim to participate regularly in presenting the good news on magazine day.</span></p></li></ul>

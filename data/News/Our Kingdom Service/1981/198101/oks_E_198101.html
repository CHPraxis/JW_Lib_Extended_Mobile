<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ber 1979, total publishers increased by 4.4 percent. We devoted 533,829 more hours, placed 292,415 more magazines, made 191,220 more return visits, conducted 30,130 more Bible studies and obtained 11,112 more new subscriptions. Truly we are grateful for Jehovah’s blessings upon our united efforts!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Following his resurrection, Jesus gave his faithful disciples a far-reaching commission: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”—Matt. 28: 19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus had already set a fine example for his disciples in teaching and disciple-making. Over 500 of them had the privilege of seeing or hearing the resurrected Jesus before he returned to heaven. (1 Cor. 15:6) Now it was the responsibility of those first-century Christians to carry on the disciplemaking work throughout the then-known world. But what about our day? We continue to follow vigorously Jesus’ example in going to the homes of people to teach them and make them true Christian disciples.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION MEETINGS-PART III How the Theocratic School Is Benefiting Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “I never thought I could do it. Yet here it is 20 years later and I’m still having a share in it thanks to the training I received in the Theocratic School!” A share in what? The publisher quoted here was referring to the fine training and experience he received that enabled him to share successfully in the field activity. Indeed, many have expressed heartfelt appreciation for the benefits they received from participating in the Theocratic School. Those who attend and share regularly in the school program find that their comments at meetings are greatly improved, and their participation in the field service is far more effective. It has enabled both brothers and sisters to be able to ‘handle the word of truth aright.’—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Clearly, the Theocratic School is one of Jehovah’s generous provisions that he has made available through his organization to assist all of his people in becoming better qualified to proclaim the good news. However, in order to benefit fully from the progressive training the school offers, we should not view it as merely a 45-minute weekly teach honest-hearted people more of the truths from God’s Word? Such help is available right in your own congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is true that we no longer have a Bible study overseer in each congregation. But now the assignment of following up on the disciple-making activity in the congregation has been delegated to the congregation book study conductors, who are usually elders. These brothers have a keen interest in your activity. They would like to help you follow up on any placements or interest you may have found. They are desirous of helping you to start Bible studies with interested ones and even going with you on your studies. By availing yourself of their readiness to assist, you may enjoy this field of service for the first time, if you have not yet done so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It is also good for book study conductors to know </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font11"> in their group conducts Bible studies as well as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font11"> the students are. Congregation secretaries may provide each study conductor with the Bible study reports of the publish-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">meeting. If we all desire to get the most from the school, we will want to follow through on the suggestion to prepare in advance through home study. This includes Bible reading and necessary research so that we may constantly widen and ever deepen our knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. (Rom. Ilr33) In this connection, an examination of the features of the current school program should enable each one of us to reevaluate the benefits and move us to take full advantage of them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Those brothers giving assignment No. 1 have a fine opportunity to demonstrate the “art of teaching.” (2 Tim. 4:2) How can this best be accomplished? By isolating important points, illustrating them and making practical application of the material to local needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Our Bible reading program and the highlights from tne Bible reading are very important features of the school. It is the responsibility of the school overseer, or of another qualified elder assigned by him, to give a brief, overall view of the assigned chapters and help the audience to appreciate why and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(Starting with this meeting, the service meeting will be limited to 45 minutes, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font11"> including songs and prayer. Please observe this adjustment in all future meetings.) Song 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font11">“Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” The following material is based on chapter 18 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> book, pages 133-140. Elder with this part may assign to various youths beforehand questions and scriptures to be read. Certain paragraphs from the chapter are cited after the questions below, which should assist brothers in preparing comments. Please pose the following questions, have texts read and discussed as time permits. Encourage youths to participate fully in discussion. How do many people in the world feel about premarital sex? What are some effects? What does 1 Corinthians 6:18 say about fornication? (pars. 4-7) What is a sign of moral strength? Cite some Biblical examples, (pars. 8-11) What scriptures show that Jehovah condemns fornication and loose conduct? (1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Ps. 97:10) Why is God’s law on morality so beneficial for us now? Relate some problems youths are being faced with in school concerning this matter. What thought-provoking questions should youths ask themselves if wrong conduct seems appealing to them? (pars. 16, 17) What bad aftereffects result to those who give in to sexual immorality? Why does sexual morality make sense? (pars. 18-21) What examples do we have in the Bible to aid us to make a correct decision? (2 Sam. 13:1-19; Gen. 39:7-20) What relationship with Jehovah will a wise choice mean for us? (Eph. 5:3, 4; Phil. 4: 8) Our service to God is acceptable only if we present ourselves clean and undefiled. Such wholesome conduct results in a clean conscience. This approved condition enables youths to enjoy freedom of speech when sharing in the field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Presenting the Good News—^Offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">Subscription.” Question-and-answer coverage of article.

<p><span class="font9">Published monthly by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our Kingdom Service (USPS 295-860) Seoond-class postage paid at Brooklyn, N.Y. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed In U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Congregation Meetings . . . </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">how the information is of value to the brothers. It will require more preparation on his part so as to make this practical. To the extent possible, some in the audience may be called on for comments that they have on points they learned from the Bible reading for that week. Are you personally benefiting by keeping up with the schedule of Bible reading each week? One aid in preparing our assignment is to look for scriptures that build appreciation, strengthen our families in some needed quality, or help us draw a lesson from examples in the narrative.—1 Tim. 4:13; Ps. 1: 1, 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Talk No. 2 is a Bible reading that benefits all, and especially our new and younger brothers. It has helped them make advancement in their public reading ability. Due to the training in the Theocratic School, many of our school-age youngsters have made remarkable advancement in their public school classes both in language as well as in speaking ability.—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">“Talk No. 3 is to be given by our sisters. This assignment includes younger ones, whenever possible, and an assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer. Additional sisters may be used if desired to make various settings practical. Situations arising at home, in the field service, in the congregation and elsewhere may be used to make this portion practical, realistic and instructive for all present. Of course, the prime consideration should be directed to the material rather than the setting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Talk No. 4 is to be given preferably by male students. This talk, presented to the entire audience, is based on various </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> articles. The material should be truly informative and beneficial, aiding listeners to “make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.”—1 Thess. 5:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> A most helpful feature of the school will be the counsel given from the platform after each talk. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">This will</span><span class="font11"> help students to appreciate the points to work on for improvement. All can actually benefit from this provision by applying certain principles to their own efforts in speaking the truth and making disciples. (Phil. 3:16) Do we not always look to Jehovah for counsel? As the psalmist wrote: “With your counsel you will lead me.” (Ps. 73:24) By appreciating the counsel from the school overseer, which is offered in a kindly, encouraging way, students will continue to make advancement in their speaking ability. Therefore,</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Back in ancient Israel, the annual assemblies were times of rejoicing and of spiritual encouragement and instruction. The same is true among Jehovah’s people today. What a relief it is to leave behind secular cares and pressures for two days to assemble together with our brothers for good association and v instruction! And how built up we are spiritually when the assembly seems so quickly to draw to its conclusion! It was good to see that over 931,000 attended the series of circuit assemblies from February through August 1980, a 3.6 percent increase over 1979.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During the past few months, most of us have had the privilege of attending a circuit assembly that had as its theme “Set Apart from the World.” Certainly the program aided us to see more clearly our position as true Christians. Yes, <sup>f</sup>‘the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” so as true servants of Jehovah, we need to fight actively against and resist the unclean conduct and contaminating spirit of Satan’s old system. (1 Pet. 4:3, 4; 1 John 5: 19) Only then can we continue to have Jehovah’s spirit and blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Keeping separate from the world requires a strong </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fight</span><span class="font11"> for the faith. So our new series of circuit assemblies, which begins in February, has the theme “Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith.” The new program will develop </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">why a </span><span class="font11">fight for the faith is so necessary those enrolled in the Theocratic School should realize that such counsel, and the spirit in which it is given, are governed by the fine principles of the Bible.—Prov. 19: 20; 2 Cor. 3:5,</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Our being in attendance regularly each week will help us grow in appreciation for this provision of spiritual education. When assigned talks, all students need to be dependable, fulfilling their assignments, so that it will not become necessary for the school overseer frequently to call for someone to substitute.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah makes provision for his people to speak the truth clearly and understandably. In conversations with our families, our friends, at work and in the field activity, let us express ourselves in a way that will motivate others to fear God and keep his commandments. (Eccl. 12:9-14) To this end, we cannot afford to miss out on the benefits of the Theocratic School.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Assemblies— Aid in Our Fight for the Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">at this time and what is involved in this fight. As dedicated Christians, we cannot afford to become apathetic or negative in our attitude toward the worsening moral climate in the world. We need to heed the Scriptural warning regarding this condition. At the same time, we are admonished to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fight hard</span><span class="font11"> for the faith.—1 Tim. 1:18; 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■* As you know, the Theocratic School schedule has been revised for 1981. In view of this, a model school will be conducted at the circuit assembly. It will be good for everyone to benefit from the district overseer’s counsel following each student’s presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The assembly program will also point out the need to distribute zealously the timely message in our magazines and why we should act now on what we have heard in order to make our advancement manifest. There will also be a straightforward part on the program showing how to go on waging our Christian warfare. These provisions will strengthen us for our Christian fight. We need to protect our spirituality as the end of this system approaches. So be sure to attend the next assembly arranged for your circuit!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Go . . . Make Disciples&quot; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">ers in his group in order to help the conductors in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Reports indicate a need for more to share in the disciplemaking activity. For example, during the 1979 service year, over </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">seven million</span><span class="font11"> books were placed with people living in this country. The average number of Bible studies conducted each month came to 275,978. So if more share in following up on placements in the field, no doubt .many more home Bible studies can be started with the prospect of additional Christian disciples being made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What effect can </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> have upon honest-hearted persons? (John 10:14) A college student found copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in the ladies lounge of the department store where she worked. Noticing an order, blank on one, she sent for a subscription. To the Witness who called on her she said: “I do love to read the Bible and since I found </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> I enjoy reading it also.” While she had a strong desire to aid others, she felt that her college course really did not qualify her to do so. She now feels that she has something with which she can really help other people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Because we all recognize the powerful influence for good found m the pages of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font11">we look forward to offering the subscription to lovers of truth and life. By reading the magazine, thousands of honest-hearted persons have come to know and love Jehovah. It has aided them to enjoy an ever-greater depth of appreciation for him and his purpose. We should plan to use all opportunities to present the good news * by offering subscriptions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> One of the foremost ways </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font11">acquaint others with the wonderful message of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is by offering it from house to &quot;house. Each of us may develop our presentation in a way that is adaptable to the local people and circumstances. However, some may enjoy using the following: “Hello, my name is----. I’m calling today on</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">people who love the Bible and believe that it has a timely message for mankind. Perhaps like many in your neighborhood you have a family Bible in your home. Have you ever wondered how the Bible can benefit you and your family today? [Let householder respond.] Notice what we are told at 1 Corinthians 10:11. [Read.] When public warning is given of an impending disaster, we do well to heed it. How much more so should we give attention to the divine warning found in the Bible, since life is involved. Don’t you agree? [Allow response.] Knowing that God may soon take action against the wicked, it would be wise on our part to listen. Second Timothy 3:15 comments on the good results to us. [Read.]” We can then offer the subscription, highlighting specific points of interest in the current issue. The January 15 issue will feature the material “Why Will. a Loving God Exact Vengeance?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What if some people in your territory are not very interested in the Bible? You may approach them in this way: “I’m calling out of concern for my neighbors. You probably feel the effects of worsening world conditions. Do you think that mankind will achieve something better in our lifetime? [Allow response.] Many Eeople do not. However, the oldest istory book available tells us that we are living in the ‘time of the end.’ In fact, God has provided us with a written warning. Notice what the Bible tells us at 1 Corinthians 10:11. [Read.] If we are to have a happy future, then we must listen to the warning message the Bible gives and then act upon it. This is encouraged at 2 Timothy 3:15. [Read.] We have found that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> has aided families the world over for more than 100 years to understand the Bible’s message and learn about a better future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Magazine routes also serve as a fine avenue for obtaining subscriptions. Those who regularly obtain the magazines have already shown interest in our journals and likely would appreciate getting them through the mail. Often, it is simply a matter of letting them know that they are available on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">subscription basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> A regular subscriber to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> who has been studying a little over a year writes: “I know this is the truth and my life has been changed. Now I am separate from the world and I look to Jehovah for all my answers. The truth has indeed set me free!” Such blessings and experiences can be ours by offering subscriptions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Of course, we may meet some people who feel they cannot afford a subscription at the time we call, but they would like to rea4 the magazines. In some places the delivery of mail is so poor that people do not wish to subscribe for anything coming by mail. So we want to be sure to leave the single issues of the magazines with them. It is always good to take note of these individuals and call back, perhaps developing several such calls mto magazine routes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Regardless of the avenue we might choose, we will enjoy much success and Jehovah’s blessing if we present the good news with sincerity and the firm conviction that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> contains what the person needs.</span></p></li></ul>

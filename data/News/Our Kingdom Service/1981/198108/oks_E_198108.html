<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> At</span><span class="font10"> Philippians 4:8 Paul says that we should ‘continue considering whatever things are of serious concern.’ And at Philippians 1:10 he encourages us to “make sure of the more important things.” He not only meant that we should </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">think</span><span class="font10"> about or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ponder</span><span class="font10"> these serious and important matters, but had in mind that thereafter we would </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">carry them out</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">put them into practice,</span><span class="font10"> (vs. 9) This would be in harmony with James’ counsel to “become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (Jas. 1:22) What are some things we should regard as being of “serious concern”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCERN FOR FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Do you not agree that scheduling time to be in the field service with others is a matter of serious concern? (Mark 13:10) For many, weekends are about the only time they have for field service, and for many elders and ministerial servants, it is about the only time available to be with the publishers. The trend in the world is to spend entire weekends in recreation. But was that the self-sacrificing course of our Model and Exemplar, Christ Jesus? Is it the course of moderation? Recreation in moderation does provide certain benefits, but balance is required so as to provide</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">maximum benefits and avoid harmful results. It is spiritually weakening to get away from “the more important things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Walking from door to door usually produces benefits similar to recreation. There is exercise and a change of pace. There is association with family members and other publishers who need encouragement and training. Precious Scriptural truths are impressed on the mind. Others are given the opportunity to hear the good news and a warning of God’s vengeance. Satisfying memories remain to provide peace of mind for days thereafter. “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">work,”</span><span class="font10"> said Jesus. His mind was on the more important things. (John 4:34) John, too, had things of serious concern in mind when he said: “He that does the will of God remains forever.”—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSOCIATION AND STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Good association is also a matter of serious concern. After mentioning those he found to be good association, Paul said: “Only these are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and these very ones have become a strengthening aid to me.” (Col. 4:11) Surely </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTSTANDING MEMORIAL REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">At the past Memorial celebration on April 19, the attendance in the U.S. totaled 1,463,070, an all-time peak. This is 101,458 more than the year before. There were 4,204 partakers compared to 4,237 in 1980. In this report we have a strong indication of the need to continue helping thousands of persons to become disciples of Jesus Christ and loyal proclaimers of God's kingdom.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Time to Pioneer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The fulfillment of Matthew 24: 14 takes place during the “short period of time” before Satan is abyssed. (Rev. 12:12) That means we also have a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">short period of time </span><span class="font10">in which to preach the Kingdom message before the end of this system comes. No doubt you have made the decision to share in that work. At Ecclesiastes 3:7 the wise man said there is “a time to speak.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">That time is now!</span><span class="font10"> But have you come to grips with the question of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">how much time</span><span class="font10"> to spend doing so? That is a decision that could deeply affect your life and the lives of others—your life, because Jehovah is pleased when you render whole-souled service— the lives of others, because “the harvest is great, but the workers are few.”—-Matt. 9:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOULD I PIONEER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Must you be a pioneer in order to be whole-souled in your service? That depends. Whole-souled service means you are doing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> you can in God’s service. It is obvious that the circumstances of many would not permit them to pioneer. There are Scriptural responsibili-</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">ties that must take priority over full-time service. So the decision to use your time in the pioneer work, or not to do so, is a decision that only you can make.—Gal. 6:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Many reach a point in their lives where their circumstances would allow for full-time service. This was true in the case of Jesus, was it not? When he reached the age of 30 the time had come for him to commence the special work assigned to him by his Father. He did not hesitate. (Luke 3:23) Just think of how much he accomplished during the next three and a half years in full-time service as compared to the 30 years prior to that. The Bible takes only a few lines to describe events during those first 30 years. But the account of his three and a half years of full-time preaching fills almost four of the books of the Bible and yet John says: “There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">which, if ever</span><span class="font10"> they were written in full detail, I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.”—John 21:25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8 mln: </span><span class="font10">Local announcements. Have capable brother, possibly service overseer, discuss how we should make August a fine month of field service as a fitting conclusion to the service year. Offer practical suggestions on things we might do to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">16 min: </span><span class="font10">“Presenting the Good News—With the Topic for Conversation.” Audience discussion. Reason with audience on importance of teaching at the door. Better to help householder reach a conclusion ■ on his own than to tell </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him.</span><span class="font10"> Ask audience to comment on this. At appropriate point have new Topic for Conversation demonstrated. Publisher draws out householder, helping him to reason on points.</span></p>

Each 15th-of-the-month issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> now carries an interesting article entitled “God’s Word Is Alive.” (Heb. 4:12) Review titles and pertinent points from recent </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font10"> such as 6/15, 7/15. Designed to help us combat apathy on part of householders. Helpful pictures practically tell the story in many issues and are especially useful when talking to young persons. Have you featured these articles in your presentations? (Demonstrate prepared presentation highlighting this article in August 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.) </span><span class="font10">Article can be used either in magazine work or when presenting offer for month. If householder accepts and reads magazines, it gives God’s Word a chance to exert power in his life.

(If no regular or special pioneers, interview auxiliary pioneers or those who have pioneered in the past.) What adjustments did they have to make in order to make pioneering possible? What did they give up to make room for full-time service? What blessings have they experienced in full-time service? Is it a full and satisfying life?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Song 54 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 61</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Local announcements. This entire program should be used to review the highlights of the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention. Bring in a few experiences some had as a result of sharing in field service at convention city. If the elders wish to switch this program with one nearer to a date following the convention attended by your congregation, they may do so. If possible, families, individuals or book study groups may be assigned ahead of time to cover certain days or sessions of the convention. The friends should be encouraged to bring their convention notes with them to this meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 50 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Serious Concom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Coni’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul did not have in mind being with these fellow workers in large, late evening parties where partaking of food and drink immoderately would be easy and supervision difficult Getting together with a few others, possibly m the home with family members present, usually produces superior results in upbuilding discussions and interchanges of encouragement. In such an atmosphere, wholesome conversation ana experiences replace loud, distasteful music. Children can be included' and Christian personalities molded. This can contribute to effective and zealous field service the next morning, whereas late partying in large groups usually discourages it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Personal study is another matter of serious concern today. For most of us, finding time for this is not easy but requires following Paul’s advice at Ephesians 5:15, 16: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” Are you willing to pay the price? Television viewing may be one place where time could be ‘bought out.’ It means weighing out what is ‘the more important thing.’ Television viewing can at times be relaxing and even educational, but reading the Bible and the Society’s literature can be more so, and in a spiritually superior way.—Compare Romans 8:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The psalmist said: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.” (Ps. 40:8) Caring first for the more important things is a delight for genuine Christians. Yes, working ard at the truly important things, Kingdom interests, brings true satisfaction and joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART I</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Why do we all like to hear good reports? Because they are refreshing and encouraging. “As cold water upon a tirea soul, so is a good report from a distant land,” said the wise writer of Proverbs.—Prov. 25:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Even a fishing trip calls for an accurate report. Is it not true that. when a person returns from fishing, he must satisfy the curiosity of all who see him? None are content to hear the fisherman say, ‘Oh, yes, I caught </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">some.’</span><span class="font10"> You know what the next question might be. And how encouraging if the number is high! Peter and his companions were somewhat discouraged when they had to report to Jesus that they had caught nothing after fishing all night. But how excited they were when Jesus told them to cast the net on the other side of the boat and they hauled in 153 big fishes! (John 21:11) Note the account does not say they caught </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font10"> or even </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">many.</span><span class="font10"> Rather, it gives an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">accurate report of 153 big fishes.</span><span class="font10"> Even the size of the fish was reported! How encouraged Peter and his companions were!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* But if that is encouraging, how much more so to hear a good report about our brothers^ what they are doing and the results they are getting! What if </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font10"> would tell us each month that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font10"> were out in field service during past months and they spent a number of hours at it and placed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font10"> literature, and so forth? We would hardly get excited. Rather, we are encouraged as we see the fine results </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Time to Pioneer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* Here is the model, the example, for all true Christians to follow. As we develop spiritually, we want to pattern our hves after this one. We never want to be like those about whom Jesus spoke when he said: “My word makes no progress among you.” (John 8:37) Has his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“word”</span><span class="font10"> made progress in you to the point where you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font10"> to imitate him in the full-time preaching work? The apostle Pam, himself a full-time preacher, reached that point. He felt so strongly about his responsibilities that he said: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news!”—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT ARE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> We can all reach that point in our spiritual development where we </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font10"> to pioneer. Yes, we can all have the pioneer spirit, even though circumstances may prevent of our combined efforts from month to month in the Service Report of each issue. For example, do you know what the very first field service report for the United States showed as far as congregation publishers are concerned? It showed there were 8,052 “class workers” out in service, along with 350 pioneers. That was back in 1920. Compare that with the field service report in this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font10"> and see if you are not encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT YOU CAN DO</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> However, it is important not only that we each report what we have done each month, but also that the report is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">accurate. </span><span class="font10">How can we be sure that it will be accurate? In this regard it would be good for each Kingdom publisher to review the guidelines set down in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book on pages 126 and 127. It would not be appropriate for traveling overseers, elders or anyone else to set down rules or regulations about counting or reporting field service activity beyond what has been published by the Society. The Society is interested in knowing how much time is spent in proclaiming God’s truths to those who are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font10"> dedicated, baptized Witnesses. So time spent in shepherding or other calls made on those who are not strong spiritually and those who have not associated for some time should not be counted if the individual is a baptized Witness. It is a labor of love. The only exception would be where a newly baptized person has not finished studying two of the Society’s publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">many from actually being in that service. Perhaps you have recently finished your schooling or are about to do so. Have you noted what is stated in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book under the subject “Regular Pioneer Service”? On page 136 it says: “Every young person ought to give serious consideration to this field of service. When he completes his years of required secular education, what is he going to do with his life?” In answer to that question it goes on to show that in the case of one who is dedicated and is baptized “there should be no doubt.’<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> September 1, 1981, will be the first day of the 1982 service year. Is that a good time for you to start pioneering? Some publishers take up the pioneer work for at least a year to see if they can do it. Many of these will find that they want to continue year after year. Yes, many of us make decisions every day. But there are few decisions that one could make that would bring more happiness or lasting benefits than the decision to pioneer. One wiser than Solomon has told us there is a time to speak. Now is a good time to pioneer for those wnose circumstances permit.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Topic for Conversation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> If people are to respond to God’s promises, the real meaning of those promises should be easily understood. We can aid them in understanding when we ourselves clearly grasp what the Scriptures mean and make the explanation simple to them. It means that we must be prepared to reason with them on Bible texts. (Acts 17:2, 3) To do so, we can carefully prepare simple questions, based on certain key words in the text itself, that will help them grasp the meaning. For example, we could tell the householder that the “new earth” means a righteous human society, but it is much more effective if we use simple questions that will enable him to reach this conclusion in his own mind. We should be prepared to isolate the thought-conveying words in the verse, and then phrase simple questions that will stimulate thinking on the part of the householder. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sg,</span><span class="font10"> page 129.) We must be ready to answer the questions ourselves, if necessary, so as to avoid embarrassing anyone. Let us consider how this might be done, using the text at 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> After an appropriate introduction we could say: “Truly there are conditions existing today that cause us to be very concerned about the future, are there not? [Give opportunity to answer and give examples.] Do you think that conditions will ever improve' and that people will be able to live on earth in peace and security? [Allow answer.] Notice this promise of better things as set forth in the Bible at 2 Peter 3:13. [Read, then discuss text.] God promises a ‘new earth.’ What do you think God means by a ‘new earth’? Does it mean he will create another planet, new ground under our feet, and call it a ‘new earth’? Do we need new ground, mountains, lakes and trees? Notice, the verse says ‘righteousness is to dwell’ in the ‘new earth.’ Righteousness is the quality that must be manifested by people doing the right thing, so the ‘new earth’ obviously refers to renewed or righteous people who will live in peace and unity with their neighbors. We really do not need a new globe. We need changed people.” If you are limiting your presentation to a simple, one-scripture discussion, you could conclude at this point by turning to Story 115 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> and share the picture of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">what conditions will be like in the “new earth.” Offer the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> Some may want to proceed further with the discussion. Depending upon the response, you could go on to discuss other aspects of the same verse. Call to the attention of the householder that “his promise” also includes a “new heavens.” You could ask: “Do we need a new sky or universe?” (Allow householder to comment.) Point out again in text that “righteousness is to dwell” there too, so it must refer to righteous, heavenly rulers who will beautify earth and uplift human society. You can point out that “ungodly men” who make up “the heavens and earth that are now” will be done away with, destroyed. —2 Pet. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If time permits, you can show the changes that are to take place, according to Revelation 21:3, 4 or Isaiah 65:17, 22, 23. In making your transition go to Story 115 and discuss paragraph two and</span></p>

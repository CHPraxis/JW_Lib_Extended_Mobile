<p><span class="font4">’Tis one thing, too, to read it with delight</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And quite another thing to read it right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ Some read it with design to learn to read, But to the subjeCt pay but little heed; Some read it as their duty once a week, But no instruction from the Bible seek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Some read to bring themselves into repute, By showing others how they can dispute; Whilst others read because their neighbors do, To see how long ’twill take to read it through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Some read the blessed Book, they don’t know why; It somehow happens in the way to lie;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whilst others read it with uncommon care, But all to find some contradictions there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ One reads with father’s specs upon his head, And sees the thing just as his father did ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reads through Campbell or through <sup>t</sup>'cott, And thinks it means exaCtly what </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">l/:cy</span><span class="font4"> thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Some read to prove a preadopted creed, Thus understand but little what they read; And every passage of the book they bend To make it suit that all important end. Some people read, as I have often thought, To teach the Book instead of being taught.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“ It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be possible that the good mother and her wandering child are forever separated? — forever and forever ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“ I </span><span class="font3">believe it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and skeptics—makes Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave — a lost child, a lost soul ! * * *</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“ This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love, and mercy, and wisdom. There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to remove from them the dark and gloomy meaning. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">see that editors of leading journals, and many orthodox ministers of different denominations, have endorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation of God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort, for we are all prisoners of hope. This is an age of advanced thought, and more thinking is done than ever before—men </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dare</span><span class="font3"> think now. Light—more light is the watchword.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This Traci belongs to God. Receive the truth it contains, dear Christian Friend, as His loving message to you. Read and prayerfully compare </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">with His Word ; then pass it quickly into other hands for Him.</span></p><img src="otq_E_014_files/otq_E_014-2.png" alt="" style="width:163pt;height:26pt;">
<p><span class="font3">AND</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>NEEDFUL HELPS THERETO.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Our Redeemer prayed for his disciples—“ Sanctify them through thy truth;”, and then added, “Thy Word is truth.” (John 17: 17.) He thus showed us a general principle, and one which experience demonstrates —that God’s truth is his agency for developing his children. Not general truths, however good and beautiful, as botany, astronomy, etc., but truths which God reveals in his Word, are those which tend to produce in us, if we heartily receive them, the graces of God’s spirit—the spirit of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the questions arise—“What is God's truth?” “What is God’s Word ?” For it will be remembered that at the time our Lord said, “ Thy Word is truth,” the New Testament had not been written. It does not follow, however, that our Lord meant that the Law and the Prophets (the Old Testament) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">alone</span><span class="font4"> were to be considered the Word of God adapted and intended to sandiify us; but, rather, that all that God has caused to be written by the prophets, together with all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">explanations of</span><span class="font4"> those Old Testament writings which he would supply through Christ’s teachings, and afterward through the writings of the apostles, were to be esteemed as God’s Word—revelations of truth which would sandiify those believing them, who a&lt;ft accordingly. This he clearly showed when he declared, My dodlrine is not mine, but his that sent me;” “ The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life;” “ I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth; and he will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">show you things to come.”—</span><span class="font4">John 7<sup>:I</sup>$&gt; 6:63; 16:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is evident then that the opinion of many, that the prophecies of the Old Testament are all fulfilled and not now worthy of reverent study, is a great mistake—a serious mistake, because it blinds them to the great and beautiful promises therein revealed which are still future and vitally associated with the true Christian faith and hope; and it is largely because of a failure to appreciate the Old Testament prophecies, that so many of God’s children have gotten so sadly mixed on all the teachings of the New Testament— shown by the conflicting creeds of Christendom. The apostles were continually referring to the statements of the prophets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and interpreting them, </span><span class="font4">and reasoning from THAT basis. (See, for instances, A&lt;Ts 2: 24-32; 3: 19-22; Rom. II: 2, 8, 9; Gal. 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the prophecies they deduced and stated conclusions regarding the Lord’s will in the present age and declared his future purposes. (See Rom. 11: 25-32; Acts 15 :14-16.) No wonder, then, that those who ignore the Old Testament should but dimly understand the arguments of the New Testament which are based upon those previous revelations.—Luke 24: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of recognizing the various ages and dispensations—the Patriarchal age, the Jewish age, the Gospel age and “ the Ages to Come ”—and recognizing the work God is gradually perfecting through these ages, they think of Cod’s dealings as almost aimless and without order. Hence, instead of rightly dividing and applying the various statements of Scripture, severalty, to the various ages and dispensations to which they properly belong, they- mix them all together and have a disorderly and seemingly contradictory mass which they cannot understand and can scarcely realize to be a revelation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But, on the contrary, when the various ages are clearly in mind, and when the plan of God with reference to them is once seen, the B ble becomes an open book before the humble student—a great treasure-house of truth and grace, every statement of which can be definitely located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And when rightly applied to its proper age—past, present or future, as the case may be—the whole record from Genesis toRevelation falls into harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many able and valuable works on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Credibility of the Bible</span><span class="font4"> are ob • tainable through any book-seller, or in any public library; but the most of these are written in a style for the scholarly only, and, filling several volumes, require more time than many are able to give for the information. Hence few people know, as they ought, the firm foundation which God’s Word really affords for their faith; and, as a result, many have but little faith in and are often ashamed of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But we want to call your attention to a very brief and pointed treatise on this subjedt— one which you can digest in a few hours and which will strengthen your faith in God’s Word for the remainder of your life. It is contained in the first three chapters of a book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“ The Plan of the Ages.&quot;</span><span class="font4"> We supply it at the unremunerative price of 25 cents—post-paid. You and your friends need this “ Helping Hand.” Do not delay getting it.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font4">WHAT FRIENDLY REVIEWERS SAY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ This volume takes up the subjedt at a point where the skeptically inclined will be most interested, and proceeds with the important theme in logical order, step by step. The author, while a close reasoner, is eminently Scriptural, bringing forth a ‘ Thus saith the Lord’ to substantiate all his arguments. The subjedt and its treatment are deeply interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Indiana Farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ It is a strong writing, showing much research and excellent arrangement and method in its treatment of its subjedts. None will doubt the honesty and earnestness, or the intended devotion to truth, of the author. From a scholarly standpoint the book will be marked as one of merited literary excellence.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Inter-Ocean, Chicago, III.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">—Luke, io : 16.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’Tis one thing, friend, to read the Bible through, Another thing to read, to learn and do; . <sup>s</sup>Tis one thing, too, to read it with delight, And quite another thing to read it right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some read it with design to learn to read, But to the subject pay but little heed;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some read it as their duty once a week, But no instruction from the Bible seek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some read to bring themselves into repute, By showing others how they can dispute; Whilst others read because their neighbors do, To see how long t’will take to read it through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some read the blessed Book,they don’t know why;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It somehow happens in the way to lie;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whilst others read it with uncommon care, But all to find some contradictions there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One reads with father’s specs upon his head, . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sees the thing just as his father did;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reads through Campbell or through Scott, And thinks it means exadtly what </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font4"> thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some read to prove a pre-adopted creed, Thus understand but little what they read ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And every passage in the book they bend To make it suit that all important end. Some people read, as I have often thought, To teach the Book instead of being taught.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A</span><span class="font0"> DARK CLOUD AND ITS SILVER LINING.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Minister’s morning sermon, he told of the primal fall, And how,henceforth the wrath of God rested on each and all;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And how, of His will and pleasure, all souls, save a chosen few, Were doomed to eternal torture, and held in the way thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet never, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font4"> Faith’s unreason, a saintlier soul was tried, And never the harsh old lesson a tenderer heart belied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And after the painful service, on that pleasant, bright first day. He walked with his little daughter thro’ the apple bloom of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sweet in the fresh green meadow sparrow and blackbird sung;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Above him its tinted petals the blossoming orchard hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Around, on the wonderful glory, the minister looked and smiled : “ How good is the Lord,who gives us these gifts from His hand, my child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">« Behold in the bloom of apples, and the violets in the sward, A hint of the old lost beauty of the garden of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then upspake the little maiden, treading on snow and pink, O father I these pretty blossoms are very wicked I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Had there been no Garden of Eden, there never had been a fall; And if never a tree had blossomed, God would have, loved us all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Hush, child!” the father answered, “ By His decree man fell;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His ways are in clouds and darkness, but He doeth all things well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ A lid whether by His oidaming to us Cometh good or ill, Joy or pain, or light or shadow, we must fear and love Him still.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Oh, I fear Him!” said the daughter, “ and I try to love Him, too; But I wish He were kind and gentle—kind and loving as you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The minister groaned in spirit, as the tremulous lips of pain, And wide, wet eyes, uplifted, questioned his own in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bowing his head, he pondered the words of his little one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had he erred in his life-long teachings? and wrong to his Master done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To what grim and dreadful idol had he lent the holiest name ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did his own heart, loving and human, the God of his worship shame ? And lo! from the bloom and greenness, from the tender skies above, And the face of little daughter, he read a lesson of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No more as the cloudy terror of Sinai’s mount of law. But as Christ in the Syrian lilies the vision of God he saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And as when, in the clefts of Horeb, of old was his presence known, The dread, ineffable glory was infinite goodness alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereafter his hearers noted in his prayers a tenderer strain, And never the message of hatred burned on his lips again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And the scoffing longue was prayerful, and the blinded eyes found sight, And hearts, as flint aforetime, grew soft in his warmth and light.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark15"></a>THE SILVER LINING OF THE DARK CLOUD.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The poet has graphically pictured the darkness which has so long oppressed God’s people; but the same God who is now lifting the curtain and bringing to light labor-saving conveniences, preparatory to the great reign of righteousness, peace and blessing, called the Millennium, is also bringing to light certain teachings in his Word bearing upon the same period, showing that he has yet in store for that time great spiritual blessings for men. And this is only what we should expect:, according to God’s promise (Dan.I2:4,9; I Thes. 5:4-6; Duke 8:10), and according to our prayer, “ Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the light of this further unfolding of the Scriptures it appears that we and many of God’s people have been right in urging that God’s character would yet be cleared of the charges of injustice and cruelty so long urged against him by scoffers, and supported not only by the Creeds of Christendom, but seemingly also by some dark-looking passages in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But we can only give you a mere hint of the blessing and encouragement now obtainable by those who hunger and thirst after righteousness— truth, etc. The light has come through studying-the Bible and God’s plan </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dispensationally—</span><span class="font4">recognizing the various ages as connected in one great, good, loving plan which God had purposed in himself before the creation of our race, which </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">began</span><span class="font4"> to be accomplished when Christ our Lord died for our sins, and which is to be fully accomplished by Christ and his Church glorified, during an age just dawning, whose light is even now waking up the world. The key to the understanding of God’s gracious plan has long lain hidden in six words in our text—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“ a ransom for all?</span><span class="font4"> and the assurance that this favor for all shall reach them in God’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“due time.<sup>1</sup>'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we introduce to you a book which, in the name of God and for the blessing of his Church, we are circulating everywhere, at the unremunera-tive price of 25 cents, and loaning it freely to those too poor to purchase—</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font4">Food and Comfort for all ’Thinkers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be possible that the good mother and her wandering child are forever separated ?—forever and forever ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* I believe it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and skeptics—makes Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave—a lost child, a lost soul! * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. Ij. is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text , and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love, and mercy, and wisdom, I here is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to remove from them the dark and gloomy meaning. I see that editors of leading journals, and many orthodox ministers of different denominations, have endorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation 01' God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort, for we are all prisoners of hope. This is an age of advanced thought, and more thinking is done than ever before— men dare to think now. Light—more light is the watchword.”</span></p>

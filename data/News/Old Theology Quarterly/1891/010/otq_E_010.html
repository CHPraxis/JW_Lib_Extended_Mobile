<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark20"></a>'THE ONE I^AITH,</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">One Lord, One Hope, One Baptism, One God and Father, and One Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men—specially [or most fully and everlastingly] of ■ those that believe.”—i Tim. 4: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.”—1 Cor. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All ye are brethren, and one is your Master, even Christ. (Matt. 23: 8.) Your Master declares: “If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.” “And this is his commandment, that we love one another.” “We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren”—serving them—especially with the spiritual food and clothing which God’s Word supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">LET US SEEK TO WALK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to preserve the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">unity of the spirit [oneness of mind] in the bond of peace. There is ONE body [Church], with one spirit [one sentiment or disposition], even as we are called in ONE hope of our calling; one lord, one faith, one </span><span class="font5">BAPTISM, ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL, </span><span class="font6">who is above all and through all and in us all.—Eph. 4: 1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&amp; THE ONE BODY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is “the Church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth“the Church of the first-born” whose “names are written in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">heaven;&quot;</span><span class="font6"> the “little flock,” to whom it is the Father’s good pleasure to give the Kingdom; the members in particular of the body of Christ; prospectively, Christ’s Bride and joint-heir; the “Seed of Abraham,” of which our Lord Jesus is Head.—Eph. 1: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This one Church includes </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all the fully consecratedX-,^-</span><span class="font6">lievers in the redemption which is provided in Christ Jesus, from Pentecost until the completion of this one body in the end of the Gospel age. Since Pentecost this Church of Christ has been in process of selection from among justified believers, or the general “household of faith;” and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">its members,</span><span class="font6"> when complete and glorified, unitedly will inherit the Abrahamic promise and bless all the families of the earth.—Gal. 3:16, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ONE SPIRIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is the spirit of the Truth, the spirit which is of God, the spirit of adoption as sons of God, which actuates and governs all who are of the one body, in vital union with the one Head, Christ Jesus. It is the spirit of holiness, and chief among its fruits is Love—the bond of perfectness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ONE HOPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">which inspires all the members of the one body of Christ, who have the one spirit of the Truth, is “the hope set before us in the gospel,” arid not hopes suggested from our own or other men’s imaginations or conjectures. The one hope is a “good hope” (2 Thes. 2: 16), a hope of eternal life by a resurrection. (Titus 3 : 7.) The ground of this hope is found in Jehovah’s promises, confirmed unto us by the death of our Lord Jesus as the ransom price for our sins, and by his resurrection from the dead for our justification.—I Pet. 1:3; Acts 17:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ONE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is the Head or Chief of the one body—his one Church, possessing the spirit of the Truth and actuated by the one hope of becoming his Bride and joint-heir. He and his Father are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one,</span><span class="font6"> even as he and his church are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one. </span><span class="font6">(John 17: 11.) He is the Redeemer of his church, as well as her Lord, Exemplar and Master. And he is the Redeemer also of the whole world, and by virtue of that office he is to be the world’s Deliverer from Adamic sin and death. He it is who in all things has the pre-eminence in Jehovah’s plan and work. He was not only “the beginning of the creation of God,” “the first-born of every creature,” but more: he was the “ beginning and the ending,” he was the “Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last,” of Jehovah’s direct creation; for all other “ things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made.” (Col. I : 15, 18; Rev. 3:14; 1:8; 21:6; 22 : 13; John I : 3.) He it is who, to carry out the Father’s gracious plan, willingly left the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">glory which he had with the Father before the world was created, and became a man-—-a little lower than the angels—that he might, as a man, present himself in sacrifice for the sins of man. Thus we behold him as the “ Mediator between God and men, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font6"> Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.” (I Tim. 2 : 5, 6.) By his willing sacrifice of himself for men he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bought </span><span class="font6">Adam and the entire race condemned through his fall. Thus he became Lord of all—not only of the living, but also of the dead—with full power and authority to awaken all, and to restore all that was lost in Adam, to such as will accept of the New Covenant of divine favor which, by his death, he sealed and made effective to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, our Lord is no longer in the flesh—he is no longer a human being. He has finished the work of ransoming us, for which the taking of the flesh was needful. He was indeed put to death in the flesh, but was quickened [made alive] in the spirit. “ Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth we know him [so] no more.” As he was begotten of the spirit at his baptism, so he was born of the spirit at his resurrection; and “that which is born of the spirit is spirit.” “Now the Lord is that spirit.” (1 Pet. 3 : 18; 2 Cor. 5 : 16; John 3: 6; 2 Cor. 3 : 17.) Because he showed his obedience to the Father, and his confidence, in that he humbled himself to become a man and tasted death for every man, therefore God highly exalted him —far above manhood, far above the angelic nature, even far above his own previous glorious station—and gave him a name [title] above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess, to the glory of God the Father. He made him partaker of the divine nature and honor, “ that all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father.” “He is Lord of all.”—Phil. 2:8-11; John 5 : 22,23, 26; Adis 10: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ONE FAITH &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is, that we w'ere reconciled to God by the death of his Son, who died for our sins, the just for the unjust, to br</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font6"> us to God—through whom we have accepted the at-one-ment with God, offered unto us. Wherefore, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; being cleansed by his blood [sacrifice], we are brought nigh to God and are no longer strangers and foreigners, but children, and heirs of his favors prepared for those who love him when brought nigh through the precious blood. Through this faith we grasp the exceeding great and precious promises of God as rapidly as we see them, and gladly appropriate them to ourselves. Faith anchors our hearts securely to the precious things of the future, unseen as yet except to the eye of faith. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The power</span><span class="font6"> of God to every one that believeth is communicated through faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ONE BAPTISM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">body and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">hope, joined to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord, possessing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">faith, are all baptized or immersed into Jesus Christ. (Rom. 6:3.) As individuals they have reckonedly ceased to exist: henceforth, for them to live is for Christ to live. With their wills buried or immersed into the will of Christ, they thenceforth live not unto themselves, but unto him that bought them with his own precious blood. Their own wills are dead, </span><span class="font6">and henceforth they recognize only the will of the one Lord, the Head of the Body, which is his Church, whose names are written in heaven. Justified believers attain membership in this Church of Christ through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this </span><span class="font6">burial or immersion of their hearts, their wills, into the will of Christ. And as the ‘Apostle further declares, this immersion of our wills (our selves) into Christ is acceptable only when it is an immersion even unto death —an entire, a complete immersion forever. “Know ye not that so many of us as were immersed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">into Jesus Christ</span><span class="font6"> were immersed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">into his death ?</span><span class="font6"> Therefore we are buried with him by immersion </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">into death;</span><span class="font6"> that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we also [from the time of our consecration, the immersion of our wills into that of the one Lord,] should walk in newness of life. For if we have, been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be [sharers] also in (he likeness of his resurrection” —the first resurrection, to be with him and like him, partakers of the divine nature. (Rom. 6:3-5; Phil. 3 : 10, 11.) This is the only real baptism, of which immersion in water is the beautiful and appropriate symbol commanded and exemplified by our Lord and thf<sup>1 </sup>apostles, but applicable to and rightly understood by such only as have experienced a full immersion of their wills into the will of God and Christ.</span></p>

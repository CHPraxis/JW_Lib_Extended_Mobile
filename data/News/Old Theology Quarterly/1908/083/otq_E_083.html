<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir and Brother:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though differing from you in my views of the Law, I,feel constrained to express admiration for the zeal with which you and your, co-workers have endeavored to promulgate what you believe to be the truth of God. If we believe anything to be right we must act upon it until the Lord grants us to see otherwise. I had far rather be wrong and consistent than right and inconsistent, though it is best of all to be both right and consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 feel justified in addressing you as a Brother in Christ because of the many points upon which we can hold . harmonious fellowship. We look to the same Father in heaven. We trust in the merit of the same great, sacrifice for sin. We are seeking light from the same inspired Scripture. We are both striving to live in the way that will be to the glory of God. We see eye to eye upon the nature of the soul, the penalty for sin, earth’s restitution to Edcnic conditions, the Babylonian state of so-called Christendom, and the impending time of trouble along financial, political and social lines. Then last, but not least, we each see the necessity of suffering with Christ if we would be glorified with him, and have already suffered a little of the scorn and derision which the world hurls at the soldier</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The o<sup>1</sup>&quot;<sup>5</sup>timer?tion r* ?.H the«e on which we are agreed will enable you to realize that what I am about to say respecting our differences is not meant in a spirit of wrangling, but solely for the purpose of sharing with you the blessedness and joy which has dawned in our hearts with this comforting light; and with almost every sentence, I breathe a prayer that the dear Lord will bless and condescend to use this feeble ministry to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our differences seem to hinge largely upon the Sabbath question, so I will come immediately to its consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We agree with our Adventist friends that God never authorized anyone to change the Sabbath of the Decalogue from the seventh day of the week to the first, but we do believe that just as truly as the Christian has a greater High Priest, and a greater sacrifice, and a greater tabernacle, than Israel had, so, too, the follower of Christ has a much greater Sabbath than the follower of Moses. Everything under the Jewish dispensation was typical of “good things to come.” (Heb. 10:1.) The Atonement Day, the passover, the sabbatic years, the jubilees, etc., were all figures of more important things, so why should it seem strange that the seventh or Sabbath day was typical any more than the seventh or sabbatic year? But in order that you may see this to be the Scriptural thought hear Paul in Col. 2:16, 17: “Let no man therefore judge you, in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">or of the Sabbath days: Which ar&amp;a shadow of good things to come;</span><span class="font5"> but the body is of Christ.” The seventh-day keepers will argue that the Sabbath here refers to some of those yearly occasions, which were also called Sabbaths, because part of their observance required rest from ordinary labor; for instance, the Day of Atonement. But this cannot be the meaning of Paul’s language, for he had already included all these </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">yearly</span><span class="font5"> sabbaths under the words, “an holy day.” In harmony with his usual systematic forms of expression Paul first spoke of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">yearly</span><span class="font5"> holy days, then came the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">monthly</span><span class="font5"> festivals, the new moons, and next the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">weekly </span><span class="font5">rest days. The Christian has a sabbath too, but, as we shall see, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his sabbath is as much greater than the Jewish sabbath as the substance of a thing is greater than its shadow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may ask: Did not the Lord in Ex. 31 :i6 speak of the seventh day Sabbath as being given for “a perpetual covenant”? I answer to this that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the very identical language</span><span class="font5"> which the Lord used here of the Sabbath he uses elsewhere of the harvest offering (Lev. 23:14), the Pentecostal sacrifice (Lev. 23:21), the Day of Atonement (Lev. 23:31, 32) and the feast of tabernacles. (Lev. 23:41.) The same Piebrew word “olam,” which is translated “perpetual” in the seventhday reference, is the word translated “forever” in the other passages. See Young’s Analytical Concordance. So if the Advent view is correct we should still be keeping the feast of tabernacles as &quot;veil as the Sabbath, but as some of your own brethren have shown, when dealing with the punishment of the wicked, the word “olam,” like the*Greek “aion,” really means “agelasting,” or “lasting to a consummation.” It is sometimes used in the sense of eternal but not necessarily. Thus in Ex. 29 we read of the priestly office being given to Aaron and his descendants “for a perpetual Statute,” the same wnrd “olam” Beino- i.iced But that ii does not properly mean “perpetual” in this passage is evident, for Aaron’s family lost the priesthood 1800 years ago. Note Heb. 7:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find, then, that Jehovah used the very same language in speaking of the .weekly. Sabbath which he used respecting other Jewish institutions which passed away when that of which they were typical came, so similarly may not the Jewish Sabbath have passed away, being supplanted by a greater sabbath? Notice our Lord’s words in Matt. 5:17, 18, “Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy but to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fulfil;</span><span class="font5"> for verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass one jot' or one tittle shall in no wise </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pass from the Law till all be, fulfilled.” </span><span class="font5">Our Saviour did not say the Law should not pass away, but that it should not pass away until it was fulfilled. But he tells us first that he came to fulfil it, so if it was fulfilled in him it has passed away. There is a vast difference betweep a thing being destroyed and passing away as a result of fulfilment. The law of cicumcision was never destroyed, but it passed away and was abolished when that to which it pointed, circumcision of the heart, w'hs set forth, and it is this higher circumcision we must observe. (Rom. 2:28, 29.) Likewise Christ did not destroy the Law, or set it at naught, but his perfect life </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fulfilled</span><span class="font5"> its every requirement, as we imperfect creatures could not, and thus he became the great inheritor of all the promises of the Law, with the right to distribute what he inherited under the Law to all who would become his. Additionally the Law </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">led to Christ</span><span class="font5"> and pointed him out as the holj One of whom Moses had said, “Hear ye him.” (Acts 7:37; Gal. 3:24, 25.) Therefore to consider the Law given through Moses as binding upon the Christian is to doubt whether Christ has accomplished what he came for; “to fulfil” the Law. Of course the Christian must study that Law, and he finds jewels of inspired wisdom in it, but he studies it as a shadow of better things, as typical of the blessings promised un-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">der the greater than Moses—Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then is the follower of Christ under no law? Yes, he is under a new law, a higher law. Just as he has a better High Priest, a better sacrifice, a better everything than the Jew had, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">so he has a better law, and it contains a better sabbath.</span><span class="font5"> Isa. 42:21 foretold that Christ was to “magnify the Law and make it honor- . able,” and we are now under </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">this magnified law.</span><span class="font5"> ‘tj-i-Law said: “Thou shalt not kill,” but Christ magnifflM that when he taught that whosoever hateth his brother without a cause is guilty of murder. (See Matt. 5:21, 22, 27, 28.) The Law said: “Thou shalt not steal,” but Christ taught us that we should not merely refrain from robbing our 'neighbor, but be ever ready to share with him what we had, even to the extent of laying down our lives for our brethren. (John 13:24; I John 3:16.) The Law said: “Honor thy father and thy mother,” but we are instructed to “honor all to whom honor is due.”—Rom. 13 '.7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, dear brother, the Adventists see that Christ magnified the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th commandments, but they fail to realize that he magnified the 4th, the Sabbath commandment, too. To the contrary they believe he made it smaller. One of your brethren put it to me this way: “Before Christ every' little act contrary to the Sabbath commandment, even the building of a fire, was to be severely punished, but since Christ’s sacrifice, so long as we try to do our best to keep the Sabbath, the Lord will pardon and overlook where we come short in our obedience to that command.” That would have magnified God's mercy, but it would not have magnified the commandment. Would it be magnifying the 6th commandment if we should say: “Before Christ murder was to be severely punished, but since then, if you try to keep the Law—“thou shalt not kill”—it will be all right if you do kill a man once in a while”? Yet-that is the only sense in which I have ever been able to find the seventh-day Adventists viewing the Sabbath differently from the Jews of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let me now present our understanding of how Christ magnified the Sabbath Law. The Israelite was to consider </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one-tenth</span><span class="font5"> of what he had as holy unto the Lord; but do we ever hear the Christian advised to give a tithe to the Lord? Not once. How much are we advised to give him? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All that we are and have.</span><span class="font5"> We are to give all that we can in as direct a way as we can, and the balance is to be given him in a more indirect way: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">e. g.,</span><span class="font5"> we give him the money we spend for fqod and clothing, because our body belongs to him and is being used to glorify' and serve him. The food gives us strength to do more for him, therefore the money we spend for food is being spent for our Lord. (Rom. 12 :i; 1 Cor. 6:2o; 10:3i; 2 Cor. 5 :ig.) In Luke 14 :33 our Master does not tell us to forsake or surrender a tenth, but “all that he hath.” But the Christian not only gives the Lord more than the Jew gave; he also gives it in a higher sense. The Jew gave to the Lord by giving to the priests and Levites, but the Christian gives to the .Lord by trying to do everything in the way the Lord would approve. “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do' with this dollar, or this hour, or with these hands?” is his heart’s constant sentiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jew. sang: “Some of self and some of thee.” The Christian sings: “None of self but all of thee.” ‘ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise the Jew gave God one-seventh of his time, but the Christian is to give him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seven-sevenths.</span><span class="font5"> The Lord said in Lev. 19:30, “Ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary.” The sanctuary was the holy structure through which God manifested himself to Israel, so to them the word meant a certain definite holy place; but the Christian finds his sanctuary wherever he is; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">every place is a holy place to him. Similarly every day is a holy day, a sabbath of rest to him.</span><span class="font5"> He has a better sanctuary to reverence and a better sab</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">bath to keep. But not only does his sabbath differ from the typical sabbath, the nature of his rest also differs. It does not merely mean a cessation from mai'.ual labor, but a rest from laboring for self in order to work and live for God. It means to rest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">as God ■rested after</span><span class="font5"> he had completed the work of creation, as the Word expresses it: “To enter into’bis rest.” God’s rest does not mean idleness, “He sends his rain and ; cause his sun to shine” on the seventh just as much as on any other day. Then how did he rest? He ceased working for himself in order to work for man through his Son. And how do we rest like him? By ceasing to work for self in order to work for him through Christ. Hear Lieb. 4:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own ■works, as God did from his.”</span><span class="font5"> And thfin Paul contin-trses in verse 11, “let us labor therefore,” not let us cease from labor, but labor to put down those selfish propensites which would lead us, contrary to God’s will, to live for self, instead of permitting us “to enter into that rest.” This rest of which the seventh day was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">type will not end with this life, but it will continue an eternal rest, begun here and consummated in eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let me digress here to say that God’s rest day was not a period of 24 hours, but, like the six days of creation, was a long period of time. In our own language this is a very common use of the word “day,” and it is equally frequent in Bible language. (2 Pet. 3:8; Ps. 95:7-10). While the day of salvation of 2 Cor. 6:2 is already over 1800 years long, so it was with the great days of creation; they were long periods of time, and likewise the seventh day, in which God rested, is a long period; it is not over yet. However, time will hardly permit me to give you the Scriptural proofs here on this point, but if you wish I may take it up later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But to return to the subject of this letter. In Isa. 58: 13 we have a description by the inspired Prophet of what constitutes Christian sabbath keeping. We must refrain from doing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">our own ways,</span><span class="font5"> and from finding </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">our own pleasures,</span><span class="font5"> and from speaking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">our own words. </span><span class="font5">That is sabbath keeping. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But the Christian must do that every day, therefore every day must be a sabbath to him.</span><span class="font5"> For fear you may not apply the latter part of the verse to the sabbath let me refer you to the Revised Version, which reads: “And shalt honor </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">it,</span><span class="font5"> not doing thine own ways,” etc. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every day</span><span class="font5"> we are to “speak as the oracles of God.” (1 Pet. 4:11.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every day</span><span class="font5"> God is to work in us “to do of his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13). </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every day</span><span class="font5"> “the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.” (Ps. 37:23.) So again I say, every day is a. sabbath to him who liveth “not unto himself.” Is not this a glorious magnifying of the Law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can now see how “Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” (Rom. 10:4.) We can understand why Paul could say in Gal. 3:19, “The Law was added * * till the Seed should come,” and then in verses 23 to 25 he boldly compares-the Law to a severe pedagogue to whom they were committed for a season, “but after that faith is come </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we are no longer under a pedagogue.”</span><span class="font5"> And we can comprehend why Paul mourns because “ye observe, days” (Gal. 4:10, 11), and intimates that the brother is weak who “esteems one day above another” (Rom. 14:5—read verses 1 to 7), failing to realize that they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> to be counted as days in which his glory is tobe sought. fl</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know how the seventh-day Adventists divide the Law into two parts, calling the Decalogue “the law of God,” and the remainder “the law of Moses,” and then claiming that Christ did away with the Law of Moses, but not with the law of God. This is an awful mistake; it was all the Law of God, because it came </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">from </span><span class="font5">him, and it as all the law of Moses in that it came </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">through</span><span class="font5"> him. (Lev. 26:46; Deut. 5:5.) Thus our Saviour,, in Mark 7:10, quotes one of the ten commandments (Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16), and then in the same verse</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a law which was not in the Decalogue (Ex. 21:i7; Lev. 20:9), and yet attributes them both to Moses. He was not the author of either, but he was the agent through whom God delivered both commands. Furthermore, ^he fact that the Law, which was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">until John</span><span class="font5"> (Luke 16:16; Matt. 11 :13), included the Decalogue as well as the ceremonial features of the Law, is proved by Rom. 7 :6, 7; for Paul, after saying, “we are delivered from the law,” leaves no doubt as to what law is meant by quoting from the tenth commandment. And as his words show we are no longer under </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the letter</span><span class="font5"> (it was the letter which was on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the stones'),</span><span class="font5"> but under the spirit, the • antitype, that which was shadowed forth in the words on stone, the greater law of love. (James 1:26; 2:8.) When we read, therefore, in the books from Acts to Revelation about the redeemed keeping “the commandments of God,” we do not think of the letters in stone given through Moses, but of the magnified law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.” (Rom. 8:2.) Notice another passage, viz., 2 Cor. 3:3-11. The expression, “written and engraven in stones,” and the reference to Moses’ face shining at the time is evidence that Paul is speaking of the Decalogue. In verse 7 he tells us how the Law was accompanied with such glory that it even caused Moses’ face to shine. Then in verse 8 he refers to something which would be accompanied with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font5"> glory, and following this up shows that when “the glory that excelleth” (v. 10) should come then that which was given with glory—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">i. e., </span><span class="font5">the Law written and engraven on stones—was to be “done away.” (v. 11). Note the remarkable similarity between the Revised Version rendering of verse 11 and Matt. 5:18. Then in verses 12 to 18 Paul shows that while Israel had Moses cover his face so they could not see the glorious results of the giving of that glorious Law, yet we should refrain from covering our hearts with the veil of prejudice, etc., as we wish to see the more glorious results of this more glorious law upon the hearts and lives of our brethren, especially as it was reflected in our great Elder Brother, the Lord Jesus.—2 Cor. 3:18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Dear brother, much more might be written, but I must refrain from more than one or two brief statements. Paul’s preaching upon the seventh day, etc., is no endorsement of seventh-day Adventism. That was a day when the cessation from labor brought the Jews together in their synagogues and gave Paul an opportunity he gladly used. Wherever and whenever he found ears to hear he was ready to preach. There were crowds in the synagogues on the seventh day. so Paul went there, and there were numbers at the market every day, so Paul preached there </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on other days. </span><span class="font5">(Acts 17:17.) So just as Paul esteemed those oppor-ajicities, so we esteem the opportunities afforded us on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">_Jn&amp;</span><span class="font5"> first day, not because there is a divine command • to consider that day a sabbath abo-ce other days, although we consider it a very appropriate day for meetings of the people of God, being our Lord's resurrection day. However, refraining'from actual labor on the first day is not an endorsement of the wrong ideas many have held about it, any more than a belief in the Bible would mean an endorsement of the many wrong views which have been entertained of its teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I fear the seventh-day keepers have been putting the new wane into the old bottles; let us rather use the new bottles provided through our Saviour. (Matt. 9:17.) “Prove all things,” including these things, and if found: in harmony with the Word of God may you have grace-to act upon this fuller light, of which Sinai’s light was but a type, and to rest in this better sense. It has been a great comfort to me to find that salvation did not hang upon such a slender cord as the keeping of a. weekly rest day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">_ There are other features of the Sabbath, for instance its foreshadowing of the Millennium, which I have not touched upon at all. Pastor Chas. T.Russell, of Allegheny,. Pa., has treated that phase of the subject most beautifully. Have you ever read his book, “The Divine Plan of the Ages”? It is a book of 386 pages, cloth bound, for 25 cents. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 612 Arch street, Allegheny, Pa., supplies them. It puts the Scriptures upon the Millennium in a new light by helping to lay aside that “veil” we have already referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Trusting you will be willing to receive this in the same spirit in which it -was written, and asking onr heavenly Father’s blessing upon its mission, I subscribe myself,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SABBATH QUESTIONS ANSWERED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question</span><span class="font5"> 1.—Were two laws given to Israel, a ceremonial and a moral law; and was it the former only that was done away by Christ, while the moral law remains?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.—</span><span class="font5">There is no Scriptural authority for such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">division. On the contrary, there was. but one Law, its ceremonial features providing typically for the cleansing away of sins resulting from the violation of its moral precepts. If it could be seen as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Covenant </span><span class="font5">mediated by Moses, it would be evident that all of its parts must stand or fall together. But after comparing Exodus 34:28; Dent. 4:13, 14, and Heb. 8:6-8, there should be no question on the part of any one that the Ten Commandments were a part^of the Law Covenant which is to be supplanted by the New Covenant sealed with the blood [death] of Christ, its Mediator—Jesus the Head and the Church his Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the apostles wrote to the new Gentile converts respecting the Law—determined not to put upon them the yoke of the Law which they as Jews had been unable to keep—and contradicting certain teachers who had said that they “must be circumcised </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and keep the Law,&quot;</span><span class="font5"> James remarked incidentally that the Law of Moses to which they referred was that “read in the synagogue every Sabbath day.”—Acts 15:9-11, 24, 28, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29, 19-21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question 2.—</span><span class="font5">We Seventh-day keepers claim that God's commands are, that we labor six days and rest on the seventh; and many of us have gone to prison because of our conviction that it is our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">duty to labor</span><span class="font5"> on the first day and on all days except the seventh. And we believe that the time is coming when the keeping of Sunday will be a yet more severe test, and bring further suffering upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.—</span><span class="font5">We have nothing to do with the making of the social laws which prohibit labor on the first day of the week; but we obey them as civil laws, as commanded in the Scriptures (Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Pet. 2:13); and we find it to be to our profit as well as to our pleasure. We sincerely sympathize with the poor people who are deluded by such an argument, and suffer therefor; and we admire their willingness to suffer for what they consider to be the truth. But they are mistaken. The laws of this land do not compel any man to violate his conscience by working on the seventh day or any other day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And it is not sound reasoning to claim that a man </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must labor</span><span class="font5"> during the other six days. If so, are those days of twenty-four hours, or of how many hours? In such a case, for a man to be sick, or to go on a journey or on a visit, would be to violate the Law, and fall under its curse.

<p><span class="font5">surely blinded whoever cannot see that the Fourth Commandment of Moses’ Law means, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;[Within]</span><span class="font5"> six days shaft thou labor and do all thy work!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for future persecution on these lines, it is probable ; not because of anj' opposition to Seventh-day-keeping, but because, according to the Scriptures, there will ere long be a federation or union of religious systems which, gaining increased prestige and honor, will make the demands of popular religionists more arrogant—supposedly in the interest of peace and the cause of Christ, i </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question</span><span class="font5"> 3.—We Seventh-Day Adventists claim that as the Mosaic Covenant had a tabernacle, with a holy place in which the high priest offered for the sins of the people during the entire year, and a most holy in which he finished that work on the last day of the year, so there is a Holy and Most Holy in heaven; and that Christ has officiated for the sins of his people in the Holy during the Gospel Age, and will for a short time before its close officiate in the Most Holy. This we understand to be the “cleansing of the Sanctuary.” We consequently used to teach that all probation ended about 1845, when Christ (we believe) went from the Holy into the Most Holy. We hold, therefore, that the judgment is all over, and that naught remains except for Christ to come forth and receive us Seventh-Day Adventists, and to destroy all the remainder of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We hold, too, that we Seventh-Day Adventists are fulfilling the “Third Angel’s Message” of Rev. 14:9-12. In the expression, “Fear God and keep his commandments,” we place the stress upon the Fourth Commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.—</span><span class="font5">You err respecting the antitypes of the Jewish Atonement Day and Tabernacle. The antitypical Holy and Most Holy are “heavenly,” in the sense of be-, ing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">higher</span><span class="font5"> (such is the meaning of the word heavenly). In Israel’s typical service these were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">places:</span><span class="font5"> in the antitype they are conditions. All of the antitypical or “royal priesthood” have access to the Holy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">condition</span><span class="font5"> as soon as they consecrate themselves or present their bodies living sacrifices to God’s service. (Heb. 9:6-) They at once have access to the antitypical “shewbread” (Lev. 24:9), “meat to eat that the world knoweth not of.” They at once have the light of divine revelation, represented by the “golden candlestick,” which the natural man perceiveth not. (1 Cor. 2:5, 7, 9-12.) They at once have access to the Incense Altar, and their prayers and services are acceptable to God through Christ as sweet incense. Thus the first apartment of the Tabernacle represents the present condition of the Church while still in the flesh; and thus we are now blest with Christ Jesus “in heavenly places [higher conditions].”—-Eph. 113.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the vail (death) still separates between us and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font5"> spiritual </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">condition—</span><span class="font5">the divine nature into which Christ has entered, and into which he has promised to conduct all his faithful joint-sacrificers and jointheirs at the close of the Antitypical Day of Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You err also in supposing that Israel’s typical Day of Atonement was at the end of the year, to atone for past sins. It was, on the contrary, for the nation, and at the beginning, of their year, to make atonement for the whole nation and to bring the whole nation into God’s favor for the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">following</span><span class="font5"> it. And the thank-offerings, peace-offerings, and trespass-offerings, offered by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">individuals</span><span class="font5"> during the year following, were acceptable</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">upon the basis of that Atonement Day offering. At the close of the year, for which the Atonement Day sacrifices applied, the people were again as defiled as the residue of Adam’s race, and required a new Day of Atonement as a basis for another year’s acceptance with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">■ as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">typically</span><span class="font5"> justified nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, You err also in supposing that the coming out of the Great High priest at the close of the Day </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Atonement will be for the blessing of seventhday keepers. He comes out to bless, first, the “royal priesthood,”—they that have made a covenant with him by sacrifice. (Psa. 50:5.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“They</span><span class="font5"> shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up my jewels.” (Mal. 3:17.) But, as tn the type, not priests only were blessed, but “all the people,” so in the antitype all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">families of the earth shall be blessed at the revelation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, when he shall come to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“glorified</span><span class="font5"> in his saints, and to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">admired</span><span class="font5"> in all them that believe in that [Millennial] day.” (2 Thess. 1:10.) The sacrifices and offerings subsequent to the typical Day of Atonement will find their antitypes in the Millennial Age, when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">those who desire fellowship with God will come to him through the Royal Priesthood, who will offer their sacrifices </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for them. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As to the Third Angel’s message: Suppose we were to admit your claim, that you are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fulfilling</span><span class="font5"> Rev. 14:9-12. That would prove nothing as to the truth or untruth of your message. The Book of Revelation is a symbolic prophecy, a history written in advance. What is occurring and what will occur are faithfully related, often without comment, just as the Old Testament prophecies relate evil things as well as good things, and often without comment. For instance, Daniel 7:8 tells about the Papal horn “speaking great things,” but does not say whether they are great truths or great untruths. So, too, in Revelation, Papacy is described and its language quoted without adverse criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question</span><span class="font5"> 4.—Christ- said that he came not to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">destroy </span><span class="font5">the Law and the prophets, but to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fulfil them.—</span><span class="font5">Matt. 5:i7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.—</span><span class="font5">Yes, that is just what we hold: Fie fulfilled the Law Covenant, met all of its requirements, and obtained its reward, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font5"> That fulfilled it, for that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font5"> for which it was intended and given. <sub>s</sub> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question</span><span class="font5"> 5.—Christ said, “The Sabbath was made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">man, and not man for the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:27.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">understand this to mean that the Sabbath was made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer.—</span><span class="font5">Your inference is not reasonable. If the Sabbath were meant for all mankind, the fact should and would have been clearly stated to all mankind. But the facts are that it was commanded only of one nation, and that Christ and the apostles did not so command. In this text our Lord is showing to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jews,</span><span class="font5"> to whom the command was given, that they were putting an extreme construction upon the command when they refused to do good on that day—to a fellow creature, as well as to an ox and an ass. The Sabbath was intended for the blessing of the men who were commanded to keep it: they were not created nor called as a nation simply to serve the day.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE JEWISH LAW AND EARLY CHRISTIANITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JnC </span><span class="font5">ANY Christians do not realize the conditions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">f IIA </span><span class="font5">which existed in the Church in the begin-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•X is*/ </span><span class="font5">ning of the Gospel Age. The Jews as a nation had been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">typically</span><span class="font5"> justified by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">typical</span><span class="font5"> sacrifices, from the Adamic curse, or condemnation, and put under the Law given at Sinai, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">af a Covenant</span><span class="font5"> under which, if obedient, they were to have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">life.</span><span class="font5"> But the Law proved valueless to them so far as giving them the hoped-for life was concerned, though it taught them some good lessons. All the other nations, known as Gentiles (heathen) were still under ■the original condemnation of Eden. Consequently when our Lord came, both Jews and Gentiles were under condemnation to death, the Jew by the Law from which he had expected so much, but with which'he was unable </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">comply, because of depravity, and the Gentile by the original sentence upon father Adam, from which he had in no sense escaped, not even typically as the Jew had. But the Redeemer whom God provided was sufficient for both; for in the one sacrifice of himself he accomplished the redemption of both, and reconciled both unto God in one body by the cross.—Eph. 2:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■The Jewish converts (and they composed the majority of the early Church) could scarcely realize the greatness of the change from the Law Covenant to the new arrangement in Christ, and were continually adding Christ’s teachings and his law of love to their Mosaic Law, thus adding to their already heavy burden, instead of accepting the sacrificial death of Christ as the atonement for their sins under the Law, and as the end of the condemnation of that Law Covenant. (Rom. 10:4; 3: 20,28.) It is not surprising when we remember their early prejudices in favor of the Law, that the spirit of truth was able to guide them but slowly into the full truth on the subject. Even the apostles were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">slow</span><span class="font5"> to learn, and we find St. Peter so slow to follow the lead of the spirit, that he had to be taught by a special vision that Gentiles needed no longer to become Jews and to conform to the Law of Moses before they could share divine favor, but that they had access to God through Christ regardless of the Law Covenant.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE JEWISH LAW COVENANT NOT OURS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Some complained to the other apostles and brethren about St. Paul’s recognition of Gentiles, and this brought the question before them all, and led to an investigation of God’s dealings in the matter. “When they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God, saying, then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.”—Acts 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Paul, most easily led of the spirit, got clear views </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">the subject earliest, and had to oppose others among the apostles less strong and less spiritually clearsighted. (Gal. 2:11.) Jerusalem was long considered the center of the Christian religion, the largest number and oldest believers and apostles living there; and as St. Paul’s views of the changed condition of things became clearer and clearer, and he did not hesitate to preach boldly what he saw to be dispensational truth, some prejudiced ones desired to know whether the brethren at Jerusalem would concur in the advanced views, and St. Paul and Barnabas and others went up to Jerusalem to lay the matter before them and to bring back a report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great debate and examination of the question on all sides followed. St. Peter and St. James, finally agreeing with St. Paul, influenced the entire council. St. Peter, reminded them of God’s wonderful dealing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font5">Cornelius, who was justified and made acceptable to God through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font5"> *in Christ, and not through </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">keeping </span><span class="font5">the Law, and urged. “Now, therefore, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">why tempt ye God,</span><span class="font5"> to put a yoke [Moses’ Law] upon the neck of the disciples </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">which neither our fathers nor we were able to'-bear?”</span><span class="font5"> St. James said, “My sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">God.” Then the Council so decided, and sent a written message to the confused Gentile believers, saying:— “We have heard that certain ones who went out from us [here] have troubled you with words subverting your souls [destroying your faith], saying, ‘Be circumcised and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">keep the Law’—</span><span class="font5">to whom we gave no such commandment. ... It seemed good to the holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things : that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, .and .from fornication.” (Acts 15:9-29.) And even these suggestions were given as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">advice,</span><span class="font5"> and not as so much of the Mosaic Law, with penalties attached.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE LAW COVENANT A MINISTRATION • OF DEATH</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul’s epistle to the Galatians </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(who </span><span class="font5">had been Gentiles) was written expressly to counteract the influence of the Judaizing teachers who mingled with the believers of Galatia and endeavored to subvert </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">true faith in Christ by pointing them away from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">cross of Christ to a hope of acceptance with God by keeping the Law of Moses in connection with faith </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Christ: thus making Christianity merely an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">addition</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to </span><span class="font5">the Law Covenant and not instead of it. This </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he calls </span><span class="font5">“another gospel,” yet really </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> another, for there can be but one; hence it was a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perversion</span><span class="font5"> of the real Gospel. (Gal. I 7-9.) And here St. Paul indicates that he knew that the apostles at Jerusalem had at first only </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">mixed Gospel, and that he went up to see them on the occasion mentioned in Acts 15:4, by revelation, to communicate to them that fuller, purer, unmixed Gospel which he already had been able to receive, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font5">he had been teaching; and, he says, he communicated it to them privately, lest their reputation should hinder them from receiving the truth—and even then some false brethren, spies, sought to compel Titus (a Greek) to be circumcised.—Gal 2:2-g.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is further along in this same epistle that St. Paul tells of St. Peter’s vacillation on the question of the Law (chap. 2:11-16) and his words of reproof to Peter —We who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are Jews</span><span class="font5"> by nature, knowing that a man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">not justified by the works of the Law, but on account of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font5"> in Christ, even </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font5"> have believed in Christ that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font5"> might be justified by faith in Christ, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and not by obedience to the Law.</span><span class="font5"> Why, then, should we attempt to fetter others, or longer bind ourselves, by that which has served its purpose, in bringing us to Christ and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">New Covenant? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">O foolish Galatians! who has deluded you ? As many as are trusting to obedience to the Law are under its condemnation or curse. “Christ hath redeemed us [Israelites] from the curse of the Law, that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, and that we [Israelites] might receive the promise of the spirit through faith.” And surely God’s Covenant with Abraham, made four hundred and thirty years before the Law was given, cannot be annulled by that Law.—Gal. 3:1, 10, 13, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next, the apostle answers a supposed inquiry as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">what was the object of the Law, and why it was given, if not necessary to the attainment of the Abrahamic promises. He says the Law was added because of sin, to manifest sin in its true light—that sin might be seen to be a great and deep-seated malady. The Law was a pedagogue, or servant, to bring to Christ all Israelites who desired to learn the true way of life.—Gal. 3:24; Matt. 11:28-30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;§</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As children are under nursery laws and subject </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">teachers until an appointed time, so were we (Israelites) under the Law, and treated as servants rather than as sons. We were kept under restraints, though we were the heirs through whom, according to the promise, ofhers were to be blessed. But in the fulness of time Qod sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law that ar (Israelites), being liberated, might receive the adoption of sons. And so also “because </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font5"> [who were not . under the Law, but were Gentiles or heathen] are [also now] sons, [therefore] God hath, sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts.” We were sons under tutelage, and you were aliens, foreigners and strangers, but now you and we, who are accepted of God in Christ, are fully received into sonship and heirship, and neither of us is subject to the Law.—Gal. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tell me, you that desire to be under the Law Covenant, Do you not understand what it is? It is a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bondage,</span><span class="font5"> as allegorically shown in Abraham’s two sons. Abraham, here, is a figure of God; and Sarah, the real wife, is a figure of the real Covenant of Blessing, out of which the Christ should come as heir of all, to bless the world. For a long time Sarah was barren; so, too, for a long time the original Covenant of God, made with Abraham—“in thy Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed”-—brought forth no fruit, until Christ Jesus. Hagar, the servant of Sarah, in the meantime was treated as Sarah’s representative, and her son as the representative of Sarah’s son. Hagar represented the Law Covenant, and fleshly Israel was represented by her child, Ishmael. For the time they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">represented</span><span class="font5"> the true Covenant and the true seed of blessing, though they were always really servants—child, as well as mother. When the true son of the real wife, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">heir,</span><span class="font5"> was born, it was manifest that the son of the bondwoman was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">the heir of promise. And to show typically that the Law Covenant was not to have any rule over the spiritual sons of God, Hagar was not allowed to become the governess of Isaac, but in his interest was dismissed entirely.—Gal.'4:21-31; Gen. 21:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle’s argument, based on this allegory, is, that we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the Seed to whom the promise was .made; we are not children of the bondwoman, the Law Covenant, but children of the original Abrahamic Covenant (the Sarah Covenant) born free from the slavery and conditions of the Law Covenant. And not only so born, but the Law is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">entirely put away</span><span class="font5"> from us, and has nothing whatever to do with us—“Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage”—the Law Covenant. “If ye be led of the spirit, ye are not under the Law [Covenant].”—Gal. 5:1, 18. /</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But Paul asks—“Shall we continue in sin [wilfully], because we are not under the Law [Covenant] ?” (Rom. 6:15.) Shall we take advantage of our liberty to break away into more sin—because we are sons and heirs, and no longer commanded as servants,—Thou shalt, and thou shalt not? No, no; as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sons,</span><span class="font5"> begotten of the spirit, partakers of the spirit of holiness, the spirit of the truth, we </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">delight</span><span class="font5"> to do our Father’s will; and the law of obedience to his will is deeply engraven upon our hearts. (Heb. 8:10; 10:15, 16.) We gladly sacrifice our all, even our lives, in opposing sin and error, and in forwarding righteousness and truth; hence we answer emphatically, “God forbid.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font5"> will not take advantage of our liberty from the Jewish Law Covenant, to commit sin. But if any man should think to do so, let him remember that only those led by the spirit of God are the sons of God.—Rom. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not under the Law Covenant, but under divine favor, and not only so, but being justified and reconciled to God in Christ, we have gone further and accepted the “high calling,” the “heavenly calling,” and consecrated our justified lives—“even unto death”—and been accepted as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">members</span><span class="font5"> of the Body of Christ and are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font5">heirs of the Abrahamic (Sarah) Covenant. (Gal. 3:29.) Hence, so-far from desiring to use our liberty to indulge in sin, we, having God’s spirit,, detest sin and love righteousness and delight ourselves in the “Law of Christ”—Love. Christ’s Word is our Law<sup>:</sup>—not a law of bondage, but of Liberty. Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein [free], being not a forgetful hearer, but one who exercises his liberty, this man shall be truly blessed thereby. Such fulfil the royal law, the law of love.—Jas. 1 ;25.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>THE LAW OF LOVE</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">If we have proved that the Ten Commandments were given to Israel, and to Israel only, and that as the basis of a Covenant made only with that nation, and if we have shown that the other nations of the world have been left by God without any Law except such traces as yet remain of the original Law, written in the nature of the first perfect man, who was created in God’s image, and that to the Church our Lord gave the Law of Love, then we have proved that the Ten Commandments should not be recognized by the Gospel Church, except as they are in harmony with the law of Love.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Lord has a standard for all who accept him, as Moses, the Mediator of the Law Covenant, had ten commands for a standard. The Master said, “A New Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.” (John 13:34.) It is the same law that was expressed in the Ten Commandments, but a more refined and more comprehensive statement of that Law, designed for a more advanced class. The people put under the Law Covenant and baptized into Moses were a household of Servants, while the people of the Law of Love are a household of God’s sons. Thus we read, “Moses verily was faithful as a servant over all his House [of Servants], but Christ [was faithful] as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">son over his own House [of sons], whose house are we, ♦ if . . . .’’—Heb. 3 :6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression of the Divine Law given at Sinai was exactly suited to the House of Servants to whom it was given: it was a series of instructions—Thou shalt, and Thou shalt not. The expression of the Law of Love is very different, and implies much more liberty. It simply tells those who are God’s sons, and who therefore are begotten of his spirit, You may do or say </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">anything </span><span class="font5">in harmony with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love.</span><span class="font5"> Pure love for God will lead not only to obedience to his will, but to the study of his will, in his Word. Pure love governing our conduct toward our fellow-men and the lower animals will seldom work to their injury. It will come more and more under the guidance of the Lord’s Word, and thus we shall be perfected in love. But from the first it is a safe Law: it is a “Law of Liberty,” in that it requires us merely to act out, according to our own judgments, that which we voluntarily consecrate ourselves to do, our own wishes as New Creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since this Royal Law of Love is made only witn those whose desires are changed, who no longer love sin but are seeking escape from it as well as from its penalty, who now love God and his righteousness, it would be manifestly improper to give these “sons of God” the statement of God’s Law or will in the same form that it was expressed to the House of “Servants.” The sons are granted a Law of Liberty, the servants a Law of Bondage. The servants were told what they might and might not do; because they were servants, not sons, not begotten of the Father’s spirit; hence they needed positive commands, restraints and penalties. This is forcibly expressed by the Apostle in his exposition of this very subject in Galatians 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How strange you would think it if we were to say, We feel it our duty to tell the readers of this journal jwho are saints, that they should not make or worship images, that they should not blaspheme God’s name, that they should not steal from their neighbors, that. they should not murder their neighbors, nor slander them, nor bear false witness against them. The intelligent and consecrated reader would feel offended, and that justly. He would say, The Editor has a very low opinion of his readers, or he would not so address them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just so it would be strange indeed if God or Christ had given the Ten Commandments to the Gospel. Church as the basis of the Law of Love. And the truly consecrated and spirit-of-love-begotten ones, would have been justified in questioning the wisdom and love of putting them under an expresion of. the Divine Law so far below their nature and wish and covenant as to be almost an insult. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the Law of Love, while it is a Law of Liberty and an “easy .yoke” to such as have the Lord’s spirit, is nevertheless a most searching Law—discerning, scrutinizing, judging the very thoughts and intents of our hearts, as well as our actions and words. In that one word Love is expressed the very essence of the Divine Law. Love to God implies full obedience, full recognition of divine character—wisdom, love, justice and pow</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">er—</span><span class="font5">full harmony with and service of God, and the exercise of those qualities of character in all our thoughts, words and deeds.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>THE &quot;LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">This Law of Love to God and our feilowmen, which we delight to obey </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to the extent of our ability,</span><span class="font5"> not of compulsion, but of a willing mind, as partakers of the spirit of Christ, is the only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Law</span><span class="font5"> with which we have to do. While it entirely ignores the Mosaic Law, its “thou shalt.” and “thou shalt not,” it really accomplishes far more than the Mosaic Law; for, with his heart ruled by love for God and man, who would desire to dishonor God or to injure his fellowman? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But as of the Mosaic Law it was true that its utterances were only to those </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">under it—</span><span class="font5">Israelites—for “whatsoever the Law saith it saith to them who are under the Law” (Rom. 3:19), so it is true of the Law of Love; it speaks only to those who are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">under it,</span><span class="font5"> and these are only the consecrated believers in Christ. It is a law of liberty, in that all who are under it are under it from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">choice.</span><span class="font5"> They came under it voluntarily, and may leave it when they please. In this it differs greatly •from-the Law </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">put upon</span><span class="font5"> fleshly Israel as a nation, in which they had no individual liberty or choice, being born under bondage to that Law.Covenant. Our Law is the Royal Law; because the “little flock,” developed under this Law of Liberty and love, is the royal family —the divine family, selected under their Lord and Head to be heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, partakers of the divine nature.—Rom. 8:17; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5"> Pet. 114.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those now being selected as members for the Bodj of Christ, are only such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">delight</span><span class="font5"> to do God’s will, sons of God and “brethren of Christ,” having this likeness to Christ. And at the close of the Millennial Age, when the rod of iron shall have broken the proud hearts, and shall have caused the stiff knees to bend in obedience, and when the obstinate are cut off as incorrigible, wilful sinners, then the Law of Love and liberty will again be virtually in force over all God’s creatures. All who shall be permitted to enter upon that grand age of perfection following the Millennial reign of Christ will first have been tested, and will have given abundant proof that they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">delight</span><span class="font5"> to do God’s will and that his righteous law is continually their hearts’ desire.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>ALIVE WITHOUT THE LAW ONCE</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">In his letter to the Romans (chapter 7), the Apostle reasons to Jewish converts to Christianity: “For,” he says, “I speak to them that know the Law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He then represents the Law Covenant as a husband, and Israelites bound by it as a wife to a husband. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">shows that as it would be a sin for the woman to unite with another man while her husband lives, so it would be wrong for Israel to leave Moses and his Covenant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Law, and to unite with Christ unless released by death;—either the death of the Law Covenant or their death to the Law Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a common mistake to suppose the Scriptures to teach that the Law Covenant died, or was destroyed by our Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It still lives;</span><span class="font5"> and all the children of Jacob are still bound by it, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">unless they have died to it.</span><span class="font5"> Only those who realize that they could not gain everlasting, life through their union with Moses (the Law Covenant) are ready to abandon all hope of saving their life by that union with Moses, to become </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font5"> to all such expectations, and to accept the death of Christ, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">ransom for Adam and all his race, as the basis of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font5"> hope of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font5"> life. Hence, only such Israelites </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">by faith reckoned themselves hopelessly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font5"> under </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Law Covenant, and as risen with Christ to a new life-secured by his sacrifice, and who in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will are dead</span><span class="font5"> to sin, —only such could be united to Christ as the New Husband. Thus, according to the Apostle’s reasoning, the-thought of blending the two Covenants, and being united to both Moses and Christ, was wholly out of the question.—Compare Rom. 6 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The text, “Christ is the end [or fulfilment] of the Law [Covenant] for righteousness </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to everyone [under if] that believeth”</span><span class="font5"> (Rom. 10:4), does not conflict with the above, because only believers are specified. (Compare Rom. 3 131; Gal. 2:19.) Eph. 2:15 should be read: “Having abolished in his flesh the enmity </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> the law of commandments contained in ordinances,” etc. Col. 2:I3„ 14 refers to “quickened” Jewish believers for whom the handwriting of ordinances is blotted out. Verse 20 refers to the Gentile converts who had to become </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dead </span><span class="font5">to the “rudiments of the world,” before becoming members of Christ, the heir of the original Abrahamic Covenant typified by Sarah, even as the Jews must become </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font5"> to the rudiments of their Law Covenant, typified by Hagar.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>THE LAW COVENANT NOT DEAD</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">That the Law Covenant with Israel is still binding upon that nation is further evident from the fact that upon their national rejection of Christ they were nationally blinded until the end of the Gospel Age (Rom. 11 :7, 25), and that God declares that he has “not cast away his people” of that Covenant, but that under that Covenant he will yet open their eyes to see Christ as the only door of hope, and that of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font5"> life purchased with his own. (Rom. 11:2, 27, 29; compare Deut. 30:1-9.) Meanwhile, we have the evidence that their Covenant continues in force in the fact that, as a nation, they have •tor centuries been receiving the very “curses” specified under their Covenant.—See Deut. 28:15-67. Verses 4953 describe the Roman siege, etc.; verses 64-67 describe the condition of Israel since. (Isa. 59:21.) As heretofore shown*, the Lord in Leviticus (26:18-34-45) declared the symbolical “seven times,” 2520 years, of Israel’s subjection to the Gentiles; and their deliverance— A. D. 1914. Thus their present experience was foretold as a part of their Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rom. 7:6 is not out of harmony with this explanation (that the Israelite who would unite with Christ must </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">die</span><span class="font5"> to his nation’s Covenant, and that the Law Covenant is not yet dead) ; for, properly rendered,! it reads, “But now we are delivered from the Law [Covenant], being dead to that wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit [with our minds, our wills],’* and not [be required to serve] the very letter of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">old, Law Covenant, which has' passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*See </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dawn-Studies,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. II., pages </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">88-93) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tSee marginal reading, Revised </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Version and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">DiaglotL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What was .defective in the old or Law Covenant? Was it sinful or bad? No. How came it then that under that Covenant we learned so much about sin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because, previous to receiving the Law, Israelites ■were like the remainder of the world—dead in trespasses and sins; and, being already under sentence of death, we were like the remainder, unrecognized of God, and without any special commands; and hence we could not disobey or increase our sin by disobedience, until the Law Covenant began to command us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, notwithstanding that death sentence under which we and all the world rested, we Israelites were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;alive” </span><span class="font5">before the Law Covenant came, because God had promised our father Abraham that somehow and at some time he would </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bless his Seed,</span><span class="font5"> and through it all the families of earth. Thus, in God’s promise to Abraham, a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">future life </span><span class="font5">was assured to us all, before the Mosaic Covenant was made; but just as soon as that Law Covenant went into force, and required that we must obey its every com-niand, in order to secure life, that soon we found that we could not absolutely control our poor, fallen bodies, however much we willed to do so with our minds. And, ■as sin developed, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we died—</span><span class="font5">our hopes of life expired, because we could not keep that Law Covenant. I speak for, or as representing, our whole nation. Thus we found that the Law Covenant, promising life to the obedient, really sentenced us to death, because we </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">could not obey its requirements. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we acknowledge that the Law and the Covenant were good in themselves, but not helpful to us, because we were fallen beings. But God intended that it should show us how imperfect we really are. (Verse 13.) For the Law is adapted to all who are in full harmony with God’s spirit—perfect beings—and this we Israelites were not; we were and are by nature carnal, depraved, even as others. And if our hearts be right, we can and will admit that we are unable to obey God’s perfect law and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that perfeetion is not to be found in our fallen flesh, even though in our mind we approve God’s Law and would gladly obey it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the wretched condition in which we find ourselves (verse 24), wanting to obey God’s Law, and to have his favor and the everlasting life promised to them that love and obey him, and yet unable to do so because of our dead bodies—fallen and sentenced through Adam’s transgression. Oh! How can we get release from this, our difficulty? We cannot obey God’s Law, and God cannot give us 411 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">imperfect</span><span class="font5"> Law to suit our fallen condition. Oh, wretched, hopeless condition!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But no, brethren, there is hope in Christ! Not a hope of our fulfilling the Law Covenant—no hope of doing those things commanded, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font5"> as a result; nor any hope of saving anything out of the wreck of Adam’s fall and sentence. That must all be abandoned. We Israelites must </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">die</span><span class="font5"> under the Law Covenant, as unsaved by it as we were before it was made, as unsaved as the Gentiles who never had a share in itt But as we realize ourselves </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font5"> under the terms of the Law Covenant, we see that Christ has </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">died</span><span class="font5"> for Adam’s sin, paid his penalty and thus redeemed him and all—lost through his disobedience—Jew and Gentile, bond and free, male and female. And this relieves us Jews, because Christ was a Jew, “born under the Law” Covenant, that he might redeem those who were under it. (Gal. 4:4, 5.) In consequence, therefore, God can be just and accept all who serve his Law in their minds and wills, and whose only-hindrance from perfect obedience is the weakness of the fallen flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">g if t—</span><span class="font5">Christ— through whom we become heirs of the chiefest of God's blessings on the divine plane and members of the Mediator of the New Covenant (typified in Keturah, Abraham’s third wife) by which many will be blest with Restitution during the Millennium.—Acts 3:19.</span></p>

There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the Church ■^—outside the plan of salvation, and if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture.

<p><span class="font6">DO YOU WOW, </span><span class="font5">or have you specially noticed, the several propositions in Daniel’s prophecy concerning '■ the time of the end ” ?

<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KNOW that Voltaire, the great infidel philosopher, who died A. D. 1778, when much more was known of the power of steam, despising this prophecy of God’s Word, declared that it had made a fool of Sir Isaac Newton when it led him to make the above statement ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KNOW that less than four centuries ago illiteracy ■was so general that the English Parliament passed a law providing for those of its members who were unable to read; while </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font5"> ability to read and write is general, even amongst the poorest classes ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KNOW whether or not you have put on the whole armor of God, that you may be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">able</span><span class="font5"> to stand in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">evil day</span><span class="font5"> already upon us ?—Eph. 6:13,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KNOW that this trouble will be socialistic and eventually anarchistic, and, according to the Scriptures, result in the downfall of all the kingdoms of the world and thus make ready for Christ’s Millennial Kingdom?—See Millennial Dawn, Vol. i., Chaps, xiii-xv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KN OW that Millennial Dawn, Vol. l, is reclaiming more Infidels, helping more Skeptics and establishing more Christians than any other book in the world? It is indeed a “Bible Key” and “ A Helping Hand lor Bible Students.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">DO YOU KNOW that many of the most prominent ministers of the various denominations are preaching on every other subject than the gospel, while some of them are denying the fall, the redemption and a coming restitution, so clearly taught in the Bible, and teaching, instead, Evolution ?—yea, and even denying the inspiration of the Bible ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font0"> WORD TO TRUE CHRISTIANS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BLESSED ARE THEY THAT HUNGER AND THIRST AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[truth in thought, word and deed]</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; FOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEY SHALL BE FILLED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Overcharged, as many Christian people are, with the cares of this life, and intoxicated, as some others are, with its fleeting pleasures, it is quite possible that a very large majority fail to discern the peculiar signs of these times, which the Scriptures show to be a transition period, closing the gospel age and ushering in the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We live in a day when many, even in the pulpit, as well as out of it, are boldly contradidling the Bible and denying its divine authorship, in whole or in part; and never in the history of the Church have so many conflicting voices confused the truths </span><span class="font6">of the </span><span class="font5">Gospel. </span><span class="font6">We are </span><span class="font5">told that the prophets and apostles, though honest, were mistaken or fanatical men who made serious errors in what they said and wrote: that even ©ur Lord Jesus was mistaken in much that he said,—as, for instance, in his references to Jonah and the great fish, to Noah and the deluge, etc. (Matt. 12:40; 24-37-39; Luke 17 : 26,27.) What is termed the higher criticism of the Bible rejects all such statements, including miracles and prophecies, as generally absurdities, unworthy of the credence of thinking men; and it accepts merely the moral precepts, whatever of the historical portions suits its convenience, etc., as from any other book. This great “ falling away ” was predicted for the end of this age, and it therefore becomes another sign of the times. Note carefully the following Scriptures, which indicate that a thousand will thus fall (into unbelief), to one who will stand faithful. Let all who would stand seek quickly and put on “ the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day.”—Psa. 91 : 7,11,12; Luke 18:8; 2 Tim. 3:1; Eph. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet, in the midst of all the confusing voices of this “evil day,” the Lord’s sheep will hear the voice of the Good Shepherd, and, following him, will not be left in the outer darkness of doubt and unbelief, but will be guided into all the truth now due to the household of faith. Such was his promise; and such should be the expectation of his people, especially now, when “ the whole armor of God,”—the full understanding and clear appreciation of the divine plan—is needed as never before.</span></p>

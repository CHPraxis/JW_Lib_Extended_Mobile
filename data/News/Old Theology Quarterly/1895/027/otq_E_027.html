<p><span class="font3">“Z </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto allpeople.&quot; “ There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.&quot;</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A DARK CLOUD AND ITS SILVER LINING.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">BY JOHN G.. WHITTIER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Minister’s morning sermon, he told of the primal fall, And how&quot;, henceforth the wrath of God rested on each and all;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And how, of His will and pleasure, all souls, save a chosen few, . Were doomed to eternal torture, and held in the way thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yet never, by Faith’s unreason, a saintlier soul was tried, And never the harsh old lesson a tenderer heart belied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And afte.- the painful service, on that pleasant, bright first day, He. walked with his little daughter thro’ the apple bloom of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sweet in the fresh green meadow sparrow and blackbird sung; Above him its tinted petals the blossoming orchard hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Around, on the wonderful glory, the minister looked and smiled: . “ How good is the Lord, who gives us these gifts from His hand, my child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ Behold in the bloom of apples, and the violets in the sward, . A hint of the old lost beauty of the garden of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ ’ Then upspake the little maiden, treading on snow and pink, “ O father! these- pretty blossoths are very wicked I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;“ Had .there been no Garden 0?' Eden, there never had been a fall;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And if never a tree had blossomed, God would have loved us all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">« Hush, child!” the father answered, “ By His decree man fell; His ways are in clouds and darkness, but He doeth all things well. against him by scoffers, and supported not only by the Creeds of Christendom, but seemingly also by some dark-looking passages in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But Ave can only give you a mere hint of the blessing and encouragement now obtainable by those who hunger and thirst after righteousness— truth, etc. The .light has come through studying the Bible and God’s plan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dispensationally—</span><span class="font3">recognizing the various ages as connected in one great, good, loving plan which God had purposed in himself before the creation of our race, which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">began</span><span class="font3"> to be accomplished when Christ our Lord died, for our sins, and which is to be fully accomplished by Christ and his Church glorified, during an age just dawning, whose light is even now waking up the world. The key to the understanding of God’s gracious plan has long lain hidden in six words in our text—“ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a ransom for all’’</span><span class="font3"> and the assurance that this favor for all shall reach them in God’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“due time’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus we introduce to you a book which, in the name of God and for the blessing of his Church, we are circulating everywhere, at the unremunera-tive price of 25 cents, and loaning it freely to those too poor to purchase—</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2">MILLENNIAL DAWN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">STRONG WORDS OF COMMENDATION,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BY THE</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Food and Comfort for all ^Thinkers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be,possible that the good mother and her wandering child are forever separated ?—forevei and forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Ibelieve it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and skeptics—makes Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■■ down in sorrow to the grave—-a lost child, a lost soul! * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love, and mercy, and wisdom. There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to remove from them tile dark and gloomy meaning. I see that editors of leading journals, and many orthodox ministers of different denominations, have endorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation of God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort, for we are all prisoners , of hope. This is an age of advanced thought, and more thinking is done than ever before— men dare to think now. Light—more light is the watchword.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“I am surprised at the truth it reveals. Truly ‘ the half was nevertold? I am greatly blessed in the study of God’s Word, which is made more plain. ’—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C. E.

<p><span class="font3">The paper bound edition of this work, of which thousands of copies were at first sold at Fifty Cents, has been reduced to Twenty-five Cents, by this Society, which also offers to loan it_/m&gt; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">io all too poor to buy,</span><span class="font3"> who will promise a careful reading of it, and to remail it. So, then, none need be without it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Delay not. Order at once.</span></p>

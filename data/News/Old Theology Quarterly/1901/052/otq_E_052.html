<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“ And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the heavens must retain until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”—Acts 3:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font6">HAT our Lord intended his disciples .to understand that for some purpose, in some manner, and at some time, he would come again, is, we presume, admitted and believed by all familiar with the Scriptures, for, when he said, “If Igo, I will come again” (John 14:3), he certainly referred to a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">second personal coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite a number think that when sinners are converted that forms a part of the coming of Christ, and that so he will continue coming until all the world is converted. Then, say they, he will have fully come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These evidently forget the testimony of the Scriptures on the subject, which declare the reverse of their expectation : that at the time of our Lord’s second coming the world will be far from converted to God; that “In the last days perilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God” (2 Tim. 3:1-4); that “Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” (Verse 13.) They forget the Master’s special warning to his little flock: “Take heed to yourselves lest that day come upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font6"> unawares, for as a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">snare</span><span class="font6"> shall it come on all them [not taking heed] that dwell on the face of the whole earth.” (Luke 21:34,35-) Again, we may rest assured that when it is said, “All kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him,” when they see him coming (Kev. i: 7), no reference is made to the conversion of sinners. Do all men wail because of the conversion of sinners? On the contrary, if this passage refers, as almost all admit, to Christ’s presence on earth, it teaches that all on earth will not love his appearing, as they certainly would do if all were converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some expect an adtual coming and presence of the Lord, but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">set the time of</span><span class="font6"> the event a long way off, claiming that through the efforts of the Church in its present condition the world must be converted, and thus the Millennial age be introduced. They claim that when the world has been converted, and Satan bound, and the knowledge of the Lord caused to fill the whole earth, and when the nations learn war no more, then the work of the Church in her present condition will be ended; and that when she has accomplished this great and difficult task the Lord will come to wind up earthly affairs, reward believers and condemn sinners..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some scriptures, taken disconnectedly, seem to favor this view; but when God’s Word and plan are viewed as a whole these will all be found to favor the opposite view; viz., that Christ comes before the conversion of the world, and reigns for the purpose of converting the world; that the Church is now being tried, and that the reward promised the overcomers is that after being glorified they shall share with the Lord Jesus in that reign, which i.s God’s appointed means of blessing the world and causing the knowledge of the Lord to come to every creature. Such are the Lord’s special promises:—“To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne. . . And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Rev. 3 :2i; 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle (Adis 15:14) tells us that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">main object</span><span class="font6"> of the gospel in the present age is “to take out a people” for Christ’s name—the overcoming Church, which, at his second advent, will be united to him and receive his name. The witnessing to the world during this age is a secondary objeCt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“MY PLANS ARE NOT AS YOUR PLANS.”-ISA. 55:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A further examination of God’s revealed plans will give a broader view of the object of both the first and second</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Restitution of All Things Spoken.</span><span class="font6"> 3 advents; and we should remember that both events stand related as parts of one plan. The specific work of the first advent was to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">redeem</span><span class="font6"> men; and that of the second is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">restore^</span><span class="font6"> and bless, and liberate the redeemed. Having given his life a ransom for all, our Savior ascended to present that sacrifice to the Father, thus making reconciliation for man’s iniquity. He tarries and permits “the prince of this world” to continue the rule of evil, until after the selection of “the Bride, the Lamb’s wife,” who, to be accounted </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worthy</span><span class="font6"> of such honor, must overcome the influence of the present evil world. Then the work of giving to the world of mankind the great blessings secured to them by his sacrifice will be due to commence, and he will come forth to bless all the families of the earth.—Heb. 9:24, 28; Abts 15:14; Rev. 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, the restoring and blessing could have commenced at once, when the ranson price was paid by the Redeemer, and then the coming of Messiah would have been but one event, the reign and blessing beginning at once, as the apostle at first expected. (Abts 1:6.) But God had provided “some better thing for us”—the Christian Church (Heb. 11:40); hence it is in our interest that the reign of Christ is separated from the sufferings of the Head by these eighteen centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This period between the first and second advents:, between the ransom of all and the blessing of all, is for the trial and selection of the Church, which is the body of Christ; otherwise there would have been only the one advent, and the work which will be done during the period of his second presence, in the Millennium, would have followed the resurrebiion of Jesus. Or, instead of saying that the work of the second advent would have followed at once the work of the first, let us say, rather, that had Jehovah not proposed the selebtion of the “little flock,” “the body of Christ,” the first advent would not have taken place when it did, but would have occurred at the time of the second advent, and there would have been but one. For God has evidently designed the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">permission</span><span class="font6"> of evil for six thousand years, as well as that the cleansing and restitution of all shall be accomplished during,the seventh thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus seen, the coming of Jesus, as the sacrifice and ransom for sinners, was just long enough in advance of the blessing and restoring time to allow for the selection of his ‘‘little flock” of “joint-heirs.” This will account to some for the apparent delay on God’s part in giving the blessings promised, and provided for, in the ransom. The blessings will come in due time, as at first planned, though, for a glorious purpose, the price was paid longer beforehand than men would have expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle informs us that Jesus has been absent from earth—in the heaven—during all the intervening time from his ascension to the beginning of the times of restitution, or the Millennial age—“whom the heaven must retain </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">until </span><span class="font6">the times of restitution of all things,” etc. (Adis 3:21.) Since the Scriptures thus teach that the object of our Lord’s second advent is the restitution of all things spoken, and that at the time of his appearing the nations are so far from being converted as to be angry (Rev. 11 :i8) and in opposition, it must be admitted either that the Church will fail to accomplish her mission, and that the plan of God will be thus far frustrated, or else, as we claim and have shown, that the conversion of the world in the present age was not expedted of the Church, but that her mission has been to preach the Gospel in all the world </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for a witness,</span><span class="font6"> and to prepare herself under- divine diredtion for her great future work. God has not yet by any means exhausted his power for the world’s conversion. Nay, more; he has not yet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">even attempted</span><span class="font6"> the world’s conversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who claim that Jehovah has been trying for six thousand years to convert the world, and failing all the time, must find it difficult to reconcile such views with the Bible assurance that all God’s purposes shall be accomplished, and that his Word shall not return unto him void, but shall prosper in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the thing whereto it was sent.</span><span class="font6"> (Isa,. 55:11.) The fadt that the world has not yet been converted, and that the knowledge of the Lord has not yet filled the earth, is a proof that it has not yet been </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sent</span><span class="font6"> on that mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Glancing backward, we notice the seledtion or eledtion of Abraham and certain of his offspring as the channels through which the promised Seed, the blesser of all the families of the earth, shall come. (Gal. 3:16, 29.) We note also the selection of Israel from among all nations, as the one in whom, typically, God illustrated how the great work for the world should be accomplished—their deliverance from Egypt, their Canaan, their covenants, their laws, their sacrifices for sins, for the blotting out of guilt and for the sprinkling of the people, and their priesthood for the accomplishment of all this, being a miniature and typical representation of the real priesthood and sacrifices for the purifying of the world of mankind. God, speaking for the people, said, “You only have I known of all the families of the earth.” (Amos 3:2.) This people alone was recognized until Christ came; yes, and afterwards, for his ministry was confined to them, and he would not permit his disciples to go to others—saying, as he sent them out, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.” Why so, Lord? Because, he explains, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (Matt. 10:5, 6; 15:24.) All his time was devoted to them until his death, and there was done his first work for the world, the first display of his free and all-abounding grace, which in “due time” shall indeed be a blessing to all. When the called-out company (called to be sons of God, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord—who have made their calling and election sure) is complete, then the plan of God for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">world's </span><span class="font6">salvation will be only beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not until it is selected, developed, and exalted to power, will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Seed</span><span class="font6"> bruise the serpent’s head. “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">shortly.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> (Rom. 16:20; Gen. 3:15.) The Gospel age makes ready the chaste virgin, the faithful Church, for the coming Bridegroom. And in the end of the age, when she is made “ready” (Rev. 19:7), the Bridegroom comes, and they that are ready go in with him to the marriage—the second Adam and the second Eve become one, and then the glorious work of restitution begins. In the next dispensation, the new heaven and the new earth, the Church will be no longer the espoused virgin, but the Bride; and then shall “The Spirit and the Bride say, Come 1 And let him that heareth say, Come! And let him that' is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gospel age, so far from closing the Church’s mission, is only a necessary preparation for the great future work. For this promised and coming blessing the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, waiting for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">manifestation</span><span class="font6"> of the sons of God. (Rom. 8 -.22, 19.) And it is a blessed fact that free grace in fullest measure, not merely for the living but for those who have died as well, is provided in our Father’s plan as the blessed opportunity of the coming age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WHERE PRE-MILLENNARIANS USUALLY COME SHORT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some who can see something of the blessings due at the second advent, and who appreciate in some measure the faht that the Lord comes to bestow the grand blessing purchased by his death, fail to see this last proposition; viz., that those in their graves have as much interest in that glorious reign of Messiah as those who at that time will be less completely under the bondage of corruption—death. But as surely as Jesus died for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font6"> they all must have the blessings and opportunities which he purchased with his own precious blood. Hence we shall expect blessings in the Millennial age upon all those in their graves as well as upon those not in them; and of this we will find abundant proof, as we look further into the Lord’s testimony on the subject. It is because of God’s plan for their release that those in the tomb are called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“prisoners of hope.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> What is, and is to be, their condition? Did God make no provision for these, whose condition and circumstances he must have foreseen ? Or did he, from the foundation of the world, make a wretched and merciless provision for their hopeless, eternal torment as many of his children claim ? Or has he yet in store in the heights and depths, and lengths and breadths of his plan, an opportunity for all to come to the knowledge of that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">only name,</span><span class="font6"> and, by becoming obedient to the conditions, to enjoy everlasting life? We read that “God is love,” and “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish.” (1 John 4:8; Joh&amp; 3:i6.) Would it not seem that if God loved the world so much he might have made provision, not only that believers might be saved, but also that all, might hear in order to believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, when we read, “That was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world” (John i :p), our observation says, Not so; everyman has not been enlightened; we cannot see that our Lord has lighted more than a few of earth’s billions. Even in this comparatively enlightened day, millions of heathen give no evidence of such enlightenment; neither did the Sodomites, nor multitudes of others in past ages. Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death ‘ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for every man.”</span><span class="font6"> (Heb. 2:9.) But if he tasted death for the one hundred and forty-three billions, and from any cause that sacrifice becomes efficacious to only one billion, was not the redemption comparatively a failure? And in that case, is not the Apostle’s statement too broad? When again we read, “Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people” (Luke 2:10), and looking about us, see that it is only to a “little flock” that it has been good tidings, and not to all people, we would be compelled to wonder whether the angels had not overstated the goodness and breadth of their message, and overrated the importance of the work to be accomplished by the Messiah whom they announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another statement is, “There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.” (1 Tim. 2 15, 6.) A ransom for all? Then why should not all the ransomed have some benefit from Christ’s death? Why should not </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> come to a knowledge of the truth, that they may believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THE PLAN OF THE AGES-THE GOD-GIVEN KEY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without the key, how dark, how inconsistent, these statements appear; but when we find the key to God’s plan, these texts all declare with one voice, “God is love. ” This key is found in the latter part of the text last quoted— “Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” God has a due time for everything. He could have testified it to these in their past life time; but since he did not it proves that their due time must be future. For those who will be of the Church, the bride of Christ, and share the Kingdom honors, the present is the “due time” to hear; and whosoever now has an ear to hear, let him hear and heed, and he will be blessed accordingly. Though Jesus paid our ransom before we were born, it was not our “due time” to hear of it for long years afterward, and only the appreciation of it brought responsibility; and this, only to the extent of our ability and appreciation. The same principle applies to all; in God’s due time it will be testified to all, and all will then have opportunity to believe and to be blessed by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prevailing opinion is that death ends all probation; but there is no Scripture which so teaches. Since God does not propose to save men on account of ignorance, but “will have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all men</span><span class="font6"> to come unto the knowledge of the truth” (i Tim. 2:4); and since the masses of mankind have died in ignorance; and since “there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave” (Eccl. 9 :10); therefore God has prepared for the awakening of the dead, in order to knowledge, faith and salvation. Hence his plan is, that “as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ shall be made alive, but each one in his own order”—the Gospel Church, the Bride, the body of Christ, first; afterward, during the Millennial age, all who shall become his during that thousand years of his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font6"> (mistranslated </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">coming),. </span><span class="font6">the Lord’s due time for all to know him, from the least to the greatest.—1 Cor. 15:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We see, then, that the general salvation, which will come to every individual, consists of light from the true light, and an opportunity to choose life; and, as the great majority of the race is in the tomb,, it will be necessary to bring them forth from the grave in order to testify to them the good tidings of a Savior; also that the special salvation which believers now enjoy in hope (Rom. 8:24), and the reality of which will, in the Millennial age, be revealed also to those who “believe in that day,” is a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font6"> release from the thraldom of sin, and the corruption of death, into the glorious liberty of children of God. But attainment to all these blessings will depend upon hearty compliance with the laws of Christ’s Kingdom—the rapidity of the attainment to perfection indicating the degree of love for the King and for his law of love. If any, enlightened by the Truth, and brought to a knowledge of the love of God, and restored (either actually or reckonedly) to human perfection, become “fearful,” and “draw-back” (Heb. 10:38,39), they, with the unbelievers (Rev. 21:8), will be destroyed from among the people. (Adis 3:23.) This is the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we see that all these hitherto difficult texts are explained by the statement—“to be testified in due time.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In due time,</span><span class="font6"> that true light shall lighten every man that has come into the world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In due time,</span><span class="font6"> it shall be “good tidings of great joy to all people.” And in no other way can these Scriptures be used without wresting. Paul carries out this line of argument with emphasis in Rom. 5 :18, 19. He reasons that, as all men were condemned to death because of Adam’s transgression, so, also, Christ’s righteousness, and obedience even unto death, have become a ground of justification; and that, as. all lost life in the first Adam, so all, aside from personal demerit, may receive life by accepting the second Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peter tells us that this restitution is spoken of by the mouth of all the holy prophets. (Adis 3:19-21.) They do all teach it. Ezekiel says of the valley of dry bones, “These bones are the whole house of Israel.” And God says to Israel, “Behold, O my people. I will open your graves, and cause you to me up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I . . . shall put my spirit in you, and I shall place you in your own land; then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord.”—Ezek. 37:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To this Paul’s words agree (Rom. 11:25, 26)—“Blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles [the eledt company, the bride of Christ] be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved,” or brought back from their cast-off condition; for “God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.” (Verse 2.) They were cast off from his favor while the bride of Christ was being selected, but will be reinstated when the work is accomplished. (Verses 38-33.) The prophecies are full of statements of how God will plant them again, and they shall be no more plucked up. “Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, ... I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.” (Jer. 24:5-7; 31 128; 32 :4o-42; 33:6-16.) These cannot merely refer to restorations from former captivities in Babylon, Syria, etc., for they have since been plucked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though many of the prophecies and promises of future blessing seem to apply to Israel only, it must be remembered that they were a typical people, and hence the promises made to them, while sometimes having a special application to themselves, generally have also a wider application to the whole world of mankind which that' nation typified. While Israel as a nation was typical of the whole world, its priesthood was typical of the elect “little flock,” the head and body of Christ, the “Royal Priesthood”; and the sacrifices, cleansings and atonement made for Israel typified the “better sacrifices,” fuller cleansings and real atonement “for the sins of the whole world,” of which they area part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A CRUCIAL TEST—THE SODOMITES. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And not only so, but God mentions by name other nations and promises their restoration. Ag a forcible illustration we mention the Sodomites. Surely, i'f we shall find the restitution of the Sodomites clearly taught, we may feel satisfied of the truth oi this glorious dodtrine of Restitution for all mankind, spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets. And why should not the Sodomites have an opportunity to reach perfection and everlasting life as well as Israel, or as any of us? True, they were not righteous, but neither was Israel, nor were we who now hear the gospel. “There is none righteous; no, not one,” aside from the imputed righteousness of Christ, who died for all. Our Lord’s own words tell us that although God rained down fire from heaven and destroyed them all because of their wickedness, yet the Sodomites were not so great sinners in his sight as were the Jews, Who had more knowledge. (Gen. 19:24;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke 17:29.) Unto the Jews of Capernaum he said, “If the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.”— Matt. 11 :23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus our Lord teaches that the Sodomites did not have a full opportunity; and he guarantees them such opportunity when he adds (verse 24), “But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.” The character of the Day of Judgment and its work is shown elsewhere.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">1</a></sup> Here we merely call attention to the fact that it will be a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tolerable </span><span class="font6">time for Capernaum, and yet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more tolerable</span><span class="font6"> for Sodom; because, though neither had yet had </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font6"> knowledge, nor all the blessings designed to come through the “Seed,” yet Capernaum had sinned against more light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And if Capernaum and all Israel are to be remembered and blessed under the “New Covenant,” sealed by the blood of Jesus, why should not the Sodomites also be blessed among </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“all</span><span class="font6"> the families of the earth”? They assuredly will be. And let it be remembered that since God “rained down fire from heaven and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed them all&quot; </span><span class="font6">many centuries before Jesus’ day, when their restoration is spoken of, it implies their awakening, their coming from the tomb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In “due time” they will be awakened from death and brought to a knowledge of the truth, and thus blessed together with all the families of the earth, by the promised “Seed.” They will then be on trial for everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this thought, and with no other, can we understand the dealings of the God of love with those Amalekites and other nations whom he not only permitted but commanded Israel to destroy, saying, “Go smite Amalek and utterly destroy all they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” (1 Sam. 15:3.) This apparently reckless de-strudiion of life seems irreconcilable with the character of love attributed to God, and with the teaching of Jesus, “Love your enemies,” etc., until we come to recognize the systematic order of God’s plan, the “due time” for the accomplishment of every feature of it, and the f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">adt that </span><span class="font6">every member of the human race has a place in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can now see that those Amalekites, Sodomites and others were set forth as examples of God’s just indignation, and of his determination to destroy finally and utterly evildoers : examples which will be of service not only to others, but also to themselves, when their day of judgment or trial comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some, who are willing enough to accept of God’s mercy through Christ in the forgiveness of their own trespasses and weaknesses under greater light and knowledge, cannot conceive of the same favor being applicable under the New Covenant to others; though they seem to admit the Apostle’s statement that Jesus Christ, by the favor of God, tasted death for every man. Some of these suggest that the Lord must, in this prophecy, be speaking ironically to the Jews, implying that he would just as willingly bring back the Sodomites as them, but had no intention of restoring either. But let us see how the succeeding verses agree with this idea. (Ezek. 16:49-63.) The Lord says, “Nevertheless I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will </span><span class="font6">remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font6"> establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then, thou shall remember</span><span class="font6"> thy ways and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters. . . . And I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font6"> establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; that thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.” When a promise is thus signed by the Great Jehovah, all who have set their seal that God is true may rejoice in its certainty with confidence; especially those who realize that these New Covenant blessings have been confirmed of God in Christ, who hath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sealed</span><span class="font6"> the covenant with his own precious blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To this Paul adds his testimony, saying, “And so all Israel [living and dead] shall be saved [recovered from blindness], as it is written, ‘There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins.’ . . . They are beloved for the fathers’sakes; because the gracious gifts and callings of God are not things to be repented of.”—Rom. 11:26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need not wonder that Jews, Sodomites, Samaritans, and all mankind, will be ashamed and confounded when in his own “due time” God shows forth the riches of his favor. Yea, many of those who are now God’s children will be confounded and amazed when they see how </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God so loved </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the world, and how much his thoughts and plans were above their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How different is this glorious plan of God for the selection of a few now, in order to the blessing of the many hereafter, from the distortions of these truths, as represented by the two opposing views—Calvinism and Arminianism! The former both denies the Bible dodtrine of Free Grace, and miserably distorts the glorious dodlrine of Election; the latter denies the dodlrine of Elediion, and fails to comprehend the blessed fulness of God’s Free Grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day of trouble will end in due time, when he who spake to the raging Sea of Galilee will likewise, with authority, command the raging sea </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> human passion, saying, “Peace I Be still!” When the Prince of Peace shall “stand up” in authority, a great calm will be the result. Then the raging and clashing elements shall recognize the authority of “Jehovah’s Anointed,” “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together;” and in the reign of the Christ thus begun “shall all the famdies of the earth be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then men will see that what they attribute to evolution or natural development and the smartness of the “Brain Age” was, instead, the flashings of Jehovah’s lightnings (Psa. 77:18) in “the day of his preparation” for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible account of man’s creation is that God created him perfedt and upright, an earthly image of himself; that man sought out various inventions and defiled himself (Gen. 1:27; Rom. 5:12; Eccl. 7:29); that, all being sinners, the race was unable to help itself, and none could by any means redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom for him (Psa. 49:7, 15); that God in compassion and love had made provision for this; that, accordingly, the Son of God became a man, and paid man’s ransom-price; that, as a reward for this sacrifice, and in order to the completion of the great work of atonement, he was highly exalted, even to the divine nature; and that in due time he will bring to pass a restitution of the race to the original perfection, and to every blessing then possessed. These things are clearly taught in the Scriptures, from beginning to end, and are in direCt opposition to the Evolution theory; or, rather, such “babblings of science, falsely so called,” are in violent and irreconcilable conflict with the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN COMETH NOT WITH OBSERVATION.”—LUKE 17:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pharisees at the first advent made the mistake of supposing that the Kingdom, which Christ proclaimed, would be a visible kingdom, composed of himself and his followers in the flesh; and seeing no army or other evidences of. temporal power for the establishment of an earthly kingdom, they thought to expose the hollowness of our Lord’s claims before his followers, by asking him the question,—When will your Kingdom of God appear— when will we see it? Mark well our Lord’s reply, which, if the Pharisees had understood it, might have been a great revelation to them. He answered, “The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation.” How strange they must have thought this answer! The Kingdom of God, then, would be a Kingdom which could not be observed or seen;—an invisible kingdom. But our Lord continued the explanation and increased their perplexity by adding, “Neither shall ye say, Lo here! or, Lo there!” Then our Lord gave the key to the matter by adding, “Because the Kingdom of Heaven is [to be] in the midst of you.” That is to say, when the Kingdom of Heaven shall come it will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">amongst</span><span class="font6"> mankind, everywhere present but wholly invisible; so that they cannot observe it with the natural eye, nor can they point it out or locate it, altho it will be everywhere present amongst men, an omnipresent and omnipotent rule or reign of righteousness. In our Common Version the true thought is obscured by the words, “within you,” which would better be “among you.” Anyone, however, can see, that it could not have been our Lord’s intention to say that the Kingdom of God was then or ever would be within the hearts of the class addressed, and which</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">“WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM, FOR WE SHALL SEE HIM -----AS HE IS.”-----</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the right conception of our Lord, in his glorified condition, is gained, and when the Apostle’s statement is remembered, that his Church shall be like him, and “see him </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">as he is f</span><span class="font6"> it is comparatively easy to understand that the entire glorified Church will be as invisible to the world as the Heavenly Father is, and as our Lord Jesus was after his resurrection; and when it is remembered that this Church constitutes the Kingdom of God, the “royal priesthood,” which is to rule and bless the world during the Millennial age, our Lord’s words to the Pharisees are quite intelligible, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation— neither shall ye say, Lo here I or, Lo there I for behold the Kingdom of God is in the midst of you”—a present but invisible authority, government, rule of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle Paul was the only one of the disciples who saw our Lord “</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">as he is.”</span><span class="font6"> He tells us that the Lord’s real spiritual presence, so far from being fleshly or human-like, shone with a brightness “above the brightness of the sun at noonday.”—ACls 26:13; 1 John 3:2; 1 Tim. 6:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">If those who have “fallen asleep” have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">already</span><span class="font5"> “gone to their reward,” why did the Master himself say that they should be “recompensed at the resurrection of the just,” when the Son of Man shall come in His glory, when </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font5"> man shall be rewarded according to his works?—Luke 14:14; Matt 16:27; Rev. ii:l8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">If the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">apostles</span><span class="font5"> were to go to heaven immediately at death why did Jesus say to them before his ascension, “Whither I go ye cannot come,” but, “If I go </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will come again</span><span class="font5"> and [then] receive you unto myself’?

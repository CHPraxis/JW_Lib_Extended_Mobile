<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Dark Cloud and its Silver Lining.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">BY JOHN G. WHITTIER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the </span><span class="font5">Minister’s morning sermon he told of the primal fall, And how, henceforth, the wrath of God rested on each and all;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And how, of His will and pleasure, all souls, save a.chosen few, Were doomed to eternal torture, and held in the way thereto. * Yet never, by Faith’s unreason, a saintlier soul was tried, And never the harsh old lesson a tenderer heart belied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And after the painful service, on that pleasant, bright first day, He walked with his little daughter thro’ the apple bloom of May. Sweet in the fresh green meadow sparrow and blackbird sung ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Above him its tinted petals the blossoming orchard hung, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Around, on the wonderful glory, the minister looked and smiled:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; How good is the Lord, who gives us these gifts from . His hand, ,my child.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Behold in the bloom of apples, and the violets in the sward, A hint of the old lost beauty of the garden of the Lord.” Then upspake the little maiden, treading on snow and pink, “ O father ! these pretty blossoms are very wicked, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; Had there been no garden of Eden, there never had been a fall;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And if never a tree had blossomed, God would have loved us all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; Hush, child ! ” the Father answered, “ By His decree men fell ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His ways are in clouds and darkness, but He doeth all things well.”’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; And whether by His ordaining to us cometh good or ill, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Joy or </span><span class="font5">pain, or light or shadow, we must fear and love Him still.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; Oh, I fear Him! ” said the daughter, &quot;&nbsp;and I try to love Him, too;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bat I wish He were kind and gentle—kind and loving as yoa.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The minister groaned in spirit, as the tremulous lips of pant. </span><span class="font5">And Wide, wet eyes uplifted, questioned his own in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bowing his head, he pondered the words of his littlb one, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Had he erred in his life-long teachings, and wrong to his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Master done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To what grim and dreadful idol had he lent the holiest name?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Did his own heart, loving and human, the God of his worship shame ? And lo ! from the bloom and greenness, from the tender skies above, And the face of his little daughter, he read a lesson of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No more as the cloudy terror of Sinai’s mount of law, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But as Christ in the Syrian lilies the vision of God he saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And as when, in the clefts of Horeb, of old was His presence known,' The dread, ineffable glory was infinite goodness alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thereafter his hearers noted in his prayers a tenderer strain, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And never the message of hatred burned on his lips again,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font5">the scoffing tongue was prayerful, and the blinded eyes found </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sight, </span><span class="font5">And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hearts, as </span><span class="font5">flint aforetime, grew soft in his warmth and light.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Silver Lining of the Dark Cloud.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The poet has graphically pictured the darkness which has so long oppressed God’s people: but the same God who is now lifting the curtain and bringing to light labor-saving conveniences, preparatory to the great reign of righteousness, peace and blessing, called the Millennium, is also bringing' to light certain' teachings in his Word bearing upon the same period, showing that he has yet in store for that time grefit spiritual blessings for men. And this is only what we should .expect, according to God’s promise (Dan. 12 : 4, 9 ; 1 Thes. &gt;5 : 4-6 ; Luke 8 : 10), and according to our prayer, “Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the light of this further unfolding of the Scriptures it appears that we and .many of God’s people have been right in urging that God’s character would yet be cleared of the charges of injustice and cruelty so long urged against Him by scoffers, and supported not only by the creeds of Christendom, but seemingly also by some darklooking passages in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But we can only give you a mere hint of the blessing and encouragement now obtainable by those who hunger </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and thirst after righteousness—truth, etc. Tha light baa come </span><span class="font6">through studying God's plan </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dispensation ally—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">recog</span><span class="font6">nizing the various ages as connected in one great, good, loving plan which God.had purposed in himself before the creation of our race, which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">began</span><span class="font6"> to be accomplished when Christ our Lord died fot our sins, and which is to be fully accomplished by Christ and His Church glorified, during </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">age just dawning, whose light is even now waking up the world. The key to the understanding of God’s gracious plan as long laid hidden in six words in our text—“ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A ransom for all,”</span><span class="font6"> and the assurance that this favour for all shall reach them in God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“due time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we introduce to you a book which, in the name of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">and for the blessing of His Church, we are circulating •veywhere, at the utiremunerative price of one shilling, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">loaning it freely to those too poor to purchase—</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark11"></a>&quot;The Plan of the Ages.”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. 1—STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">STRONG WORDS OF COMMENDATION,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BY THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Associate Editor of the Atlanta Constitution.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOOD AND COMFORT FOR ALL THINKERS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">family to be found that has not lost some loved One who died outside the Church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be possible that the good mother and the wandering child are forever separated— forever and forever ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ I believe it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and sceptics—makes. Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave—a lost child, a lost soul ! &nbsp;&nbsp;. . .'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a pyramid of God's love, and mercy, and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">^Thete is nothing in the Bible that the author denies </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to remove from them the dark and gloomy meaning. I see that editofs of leading journals, and mp.ny orthodox ministers of different denominations, have endorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation of God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort, for we are all prisoners of hope. This is an age of advanced thought, and more thinking is done than ever before —men dare to think now. Light—more light is the watchword.”—C. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">T. Smith</span><span class="font6"> (&quot; B. Arp.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ I am surprised at the truth it reveals. Truly ‘ the half was never told.’ I am greatly blessed in the study of God’s Word,,which is made more plain.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">C. E. Cook.</span></p>

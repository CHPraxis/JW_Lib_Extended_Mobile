<p><span class="font4">We are living in a pre-eminently practical day, when result! are sought rather than doctrines. Indeed, in but few Christian pulpits are‘doctrine* ever considered in these later years. Doctrinal preaching is considered obsolete, and has beets replaced largely by what is termed practical preaching. In 01 her words, the preaching of good works has taken the place of the doctrines preached by Jesos and the ajxiillcs. The reason of tins is not far to seek: talemcij'nicn, able ones of all denominations, in the pulpit and in the pew, arc heartily ashamed of the doctrines cwFes-icd in their creeds. The preachers, therefore, are glad enough ns let these alone, hoping that their congregations will forget them, and especially that they will not ask </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:line-through;">th-m </span><span class="font4">any troublesome questions rapecung thm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A s ■ result we have throughout the civilized world to-dav jutt what the Jews had at the first advent of our Lord—namely, a form of godliness without the power. Our Lord's discourses and prabies continually bora whims to the tact that the jews ot ms day, citpeeialiy the prominent ones, were outwardly pious, &quot;&quot;zealous tor God's Law, but inwardly ravenous wolves . and full ci all manner of corruption. Our Lord upbraided the leaders for their tong prayers and affectations of piety, which were entirely contradicted by their c indui 1 in dally life; their selfishness, which would lead them to take advantage of the widow, to grasp for property, and which would bind Heavy burdens of Law observance up-yn She weak arid the poor, fo their discouragement. Our Lord declared to them how they had made the divine Law of nene effect through their traditions—more than this, had made God and his Law abhorrent to the poor and the ignorant by exaggeration. For instance, the Law of the Sabbath was ex-aggcralrd and is still exaggerated in the 1 almud, wllidl teaches that to rub wheat between the hands and to</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">. Similarly, to hunt a flea would be a violation of the Sabbath Law, because it would be hunting on a small scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Taking Away the Key</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[</span><span class="font4">Thus did the Doctors of the Law in Jesus' day, by the tnlislilution of traditions instr ad of the divine Word, misrepresent the character of God and turn the attention of Ihe people from him. Thm did they take away the &quot;Kev of Knowledge,&quot; for I he &quot;reverence of the Lord 1'1 the begTnning of knowledge&quot; Note our Lord's wards, “This is life eternal, that they might know llice, the only true God, -ind Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent'* (John 17 tj.) In a word, God's creature* need to know him well and truly tn order to appreciate him snd m order to have confidence in his gracious promises. Such a knowledge is necessary to a true worship such as the Lord appreciate*, for. as the hlaster laid, rhe Father seeketh such to worthip him a* worship him in spirit and in truth. (John t.Zi, 23.) Whoever, therefore, miirepresenu the divine character and the divine plan is taking sway the “key of knowledge&quot; of God. This was the crime of the Doctors of the Law, wlikh their hypocritical profession* and prayers only brlped to aggravate: for the common people, relying largely upon the holy profession* and. teachings nf those leaders, were the mtuc thoroughly drlnded and the more thoroughly alienated from God by reason of their professions, of sanctity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Lord's words, &quot;Woe unto you, Ductors c£ the Law,&quot; had a fulfilment, icra. Certain woes fell with special weight upon this very das* but shortly after out Lord's predicrioi!. Very soon a period of disintegration set in. which affected everriliiug and every prospect of the wealthy and professedly religious class of the Jews, especially the Ductori of the Law. This led to anarchy anti nliimattiy the destruction of tteir national polity, A. D. ptx True, it meant dirt iribulmwo to all people; but. as nlvrays. those mail intelligent and in the high stations of life, must hart suffered propw-tkmately nwt in the stress which came upnri all the people in fulfilment of the prophecy,—&quot;Wrath is coms fi upon thi* people to the .utterrnori,&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Gospel Age Parallel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On previous occasions, and in Veits. IL and IIL of Scitrruu Studies, wc have shown from the Scriptures that the Jcwiih Age and people represented typically Spiritual fsrael and this Gospel Age; that the Jewish Age bejjart with the death of Jacob, the G-tpd Age with the death of Christ; that the former was established in the twelve sons of Jacob and Ute latter in the twelve apostles of the Lunh. We bare also shown ihat the former had typical sacrifices and sin-offerings, while the latter ha* a untypical or “bciicr sacrifices than those;” that the fcirmcr had a typical priesthood in Aaron and hit sons, while the latter lint! tin arititypical priesthood, called by the Apostle a &quot;Royal Priesthood,&quot; of which Christ is the Chief Prien and hi* faithful followers the Under-priesthood. We have further shown that, fheie Ages are of the same length, and that, as the Jewi»h Age ended with the harvest in which our Lord was present in the flesh as rhe Chief Reaper, so this Got pel Age will end with a harvest in which cur Lord a* a spirit being will be prevent ai the Cbkf Reaper, gathering the wheat into hi* gamer, before the great itrne of trouble, the figdratrve burning-day coming upon the world in general—&quot;a lime of trouble such as was not since there was a nation.&quot; 1 Dan. t? :t.) V&lt;e have seen that ihe trouble-day with which ihc Jewish Age ended is paralleled exactly In lime and in character by tlic period of trouble which will consummate thi* Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In harmony with these parallels it 1* not wonderful that to-day we find amongst nominal Christian people (Churchianity) conditions in many respects corresponding tn the conditions described by emr Lord amongst the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Wr should not be nnderttood as reselling that all the mpomHdiiiy of the loss of ihe Key'of Knowledge belong I to the Gins tian ministers of to'day, neither did -pur Lord charge the Doctors' of the fjw of his day with the full responsibility. He pointed back Bn the lame dau in earlier days, saying,. &quot;Woe unto y.'u! for y.'u build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.” fv. jy.J Car Lord iczzr.s to have arraigned the tlergy as a class, and to hare held ihe modern repreuentaliveJ responsible, because-' they f.Vt'U evidence of having the same spirit that their prcd-SCCUSOrj Ji; I, even though they condemned stliue of U'L’ir practices. Thus, their fathers kilted the prophets, while they killed the Lord himself and persecuted' hii fol Jowers. Nor should we ynderslsrtd Olir Lord's '-'rcriL to apply :o every insfividcal of ihe Jewish clergy, the Doctors of the Law, but rather that he spoke, of them 11 1 class, ignoring -Jie Jew exceptions.

<p><span class="font4">The Key of Knowledge of Gotl’f true character was lost long ago, buried under whnt the Lutherans style Hie &quot;dunghrll of Roman decretals.&quot; fl was Inst during the <sup>A</sup>dark aces.&quot; Luther ami some oi hit coadjutors did valiantly in striving to recover the Key, nnd at least nt hull! ol the handle. But, alas! little progress has since been made. The key, while recovered. is stfU hidden by a vail, a mist of supers:ition. and folre d&amp;C-trine. Shall we illustrate ibis.* How. -it aik? CoaM any one come l&amp; a knowledge of God—* trot knowledge, an appreciative knowlertffe, a hciely syrnpathy, a trite devotion—while still think inn of God as the all-powerlul Creator, who made mankind fw hia own pl'MSuri-. yet. before man’s -creatinn prepared for the vast majority a place of eternal lornient, manned fire-proof devils and &quot;suppiird wiih fuel trHingh far al eternity? Who thnt has ilmt rhouuht before rus mind, who that believes that unscriptund teaching, could rightly reverence his Creator as a God of justice and of. Tove? Tn pmpnm'cm as ihts cloud of error, this doctrine of Hevils.&quot; comes heeween an intelliyerrt mind and its Creator, in that same propertian it will be*impossinot have a Scriptural hope, cannot have the legiiimate result! of such a hope, namely, the anchorage of tba sonl, sure and steadfast. (Heo. 6; 19.) In harmony with this the Apostle points out the fact that the heathen cannot be saved under the call of this Gospel Age. Whatever salvation there may be for them will conic liter under the Millennial Kingdom arrangements, for liow could they at present believe on him of whom they have not heard, since now it has plcaied God to tare only these that believe and whose faith leads to the appropriate conduct outlined in the Scriptures. The more of thu faith and knowledge the Lord's people possess the stronger should be their confidence and the nobler should he their lives. This faith-know ledge is referred to in the Scriptures as the truth, as, fur instance, when our Lord said. &quot;Sanctify them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.” (John 17117.) The message of God received by faith is accepted to be the truth, to be true knowledge, and wherever it goes there must be a sanctifying, separating power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How forceful, then, is this injunction, “My people perish for lack of knowledge.<sup>1</sup>' (Hosea 4:4) Nut that we put knowledge an superior to love—quite the contrary; knowledge is the foundation, love is the superstructure, the character development. No one, therefore, can rear a proper superstructure without a proper foundation. The measure of the foundation must of necessity murk the limitations of the building upon it. Whoever has little knowledge of God and hi* character and his Word his proportionately little of the sanctifying [tower of the Truth. If the knowledge does not produce this fruitage the results are even as the Apostle points out in the words, “If I had all knowledge and had not love T should be as sounning brass anu a tinkling cymbal&quot;—it would profit me nothing. (1 Cor, 13:1,) On the contrary, whoever thinks to build up a proper character without knowledge erf! egregiously. The-Apostle seems to point to this fact when he refers (o some as building upon the One sure foundation, Christ J«us, with wood, hay, stubble, erroneous leachings; and others gs building upon the good foundation with ^old, silver and precious stones, representative of the divine truth. And the Apostle assures us that the testing time will come and that.only the latter class will stand the lust, while the former will suffer Ion,, though them-■ selves will bo &quot;saved *0 as by fire.&quot; (1 Cor. 3=13-15.) Thus docs he point out the two distinct cluses of the saved ones of this Gospel Age, known in the Scriptures as the &quot;Little Flock’<sup>1</sup> and the &quot;Great Company.” It is proper that every child of God should look to it &quot;that he receive .1 full reward” (3 John 8); that he win the great prize, that he be not one of those merely &quot;saved so as by fire,” and who must &quot;come up out of great tribulation,&quot;—Kev. ytig,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Lord’s Knowledge Attested *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An illustration of the value cf knowledge is set forth in (he Scripture in the words, &quot;By his knowledge ahull my righteous servant justify many, when he shall bear their iniquities.&quot; (Isa. 53=11.) And this surely Illustrates well the principle we have applied in the Scriptures to all the members of thejShurch, the Body </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font4">Christ, who arc required to be character copies of God’s dear Son. Note Ine following references to the value of knowledge to Lhe Church, the Elect of this present age. The Apostle speaks of some who &quot;Itave a seal for God, but not ar-cording to knowledge,’’ and dis-‘ tinctly intimate! Ihcir disadvantage in the race on this account. (Rom. 10:2.) The Apostle com mends those who are &quot;full of goodness, and tilled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one another.&quot;. (Rom. 15:14)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">And again, he speaks of the advantage secured to those &quot;enriched in Christ with 4JI knowledge&quot; (1 Cor, 1 5.) And again, he speaks uf knowledge coming through the holy Spirit (1 Cor. ta;8), and again, he reproves tome who &quot;have net the knowledge of God/'—: Lor, 15 =34</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again.he points out that God’s grace has shined into our heart! lc^ give the &quot;light of the knowledge of the glory of God,&quot; (3 Car. 4:6.) And again, he exhorts to faithfulness &quot;by pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering&quot; (3 Cor. 6:6); and again in faith and utterance and knowledge; and again hr refers to the necessity of cxsiing down all imaginations that would tend to exalt themselves against the knowledge of God. (2 Cor. 10:5.) In his epistle^to the Ephcsiafis he speaks of his own favor from God In reaped Io the knowlcdge-of Christ, the knowledge of the Mystery, mid of the love of Christ which passeth knowledge. (x=t7; 3=4,. 19.} To [lie Philippian* he writes (t:q) urging that they abound more and more in knowledge, and fpeaks. of the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus. (3:8,) To the Colotslmu Ue writes that they should lie filled with a knowledge of.God's will, and make increase in (lie knowledge </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> God. (tip, to.) He refers lathe treasures of wisdom and knowledge divine which arc hidden in Christ and intended for those who come unto dte Father through him, The Apostle Peter nho trachea that the Lord’s grace comes urto us through the-Itnowledgc of God, who hath called us; and he exhort* that we add to our virtue knowledge, that we may l-e-not barren in the knowledge pi our Lord and Saviour Jcsui Christ.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> Pet. ::a-8. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowledge During the Millennium</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the knowledge of God reaches but comparatively few of the human family during liiin Gospel Age, ami' few, therefore, gain the elemal life, it li of deep interest to all that the Lord’s Word enunciates that it is his. will that all men should be saved [recovered from the-tomb] and come to 1 knowledge of the Truth that iliey-iiiay be saved. (1 Tim. 3:4.) If the knowledge of the Lord is a blessing to us now, and brings with it re sponsibiliiy and great opportunity and blessings present and prospective, it is in lull accord with this that thc-J-nrd here promises ilitil ultimately all shall know him. and all, fherefare, have a full opportunity of attaining the blessings he is so willing to bestow upon those who seek him in sincerity. Let us hearken to some of the-promise! given to these through the prophets. Isaiah tells us that ihe whole carih shall lie filled with the knowledge of the Lord. (titq.) llabbakuk gives il very similar statement of the mailer, assuring ux that idle earth will be filled with a knowledge of Ibe-glory, the greatness,,. the grandeur of the Lord. (3:14) And again, the prophet Jerattiah declares ihat there shall be no longer need for every man to say to his neighbor and lo his brother, Know thou the Lord, for all- shall know him from the least even unto the-greatest. (31:34.) How glad we are that ultimately God’s glorious character shall be dearly seen by all mankind—when the blindness of superstition, ignorance, bigotry and Satanic deceit and doctrines of devils shall have given way to the glnriems light of the -Sun of Righteousness, with healing, restitution, in its. beams!</span></p>

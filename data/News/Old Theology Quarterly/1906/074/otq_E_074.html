<p><span class="font5">THE DIVINE WEAVING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“See the mystic Weaver sitting High in heaven—His loom below. Up and down the treadles go. Takes, for web, the world’s dark ages. Takes, for woof, the kings and sages. Takes the nobles and their pages, Takes all stations and all stages. Thrones are bobbins in His shuttle. Armies make them scud and scuttle— Web into the woof must flow: Up and down the nations go!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the Weaver’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font4"> they go I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Calmly see the mystic Weaver Throw His shuttle to and fro; ’Mid the noise and wild confusion, Well the Weaver seems to know What each motion and commotion, What each fusion and ccpfusion, In the grand result will show!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘Glorious wonder! What a weaving, To the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dull,</span><span class="font4"> beyond believing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such no fabled ages know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only faith can see the mystery, How, along the aisles of history, . Where the feet of sages go, Loveliest to the fairest eyes, Grand the mystic tapet lies! Soft and smooth, and ever spreading. As if made for angels’ treading—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tufted circles touching ever. Every figure has its plaidings, Brighter forms and softer shadings, Each illumined—what a riddle!—• From a cross that gems the middle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">** ’Tis a saying—some reject it— That its light is all reflected; That the tapet’s lines are given By a Sun that shines in heaven. 'Tis believed—by all believing— That great God, Himself, is weaving, Bringing out the world’s dark mystery. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">the light of faith and history;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And, as web and woof diminish, -Comes the grand and glorious finish, When begin the Golden Ages, Long foretold by seers and sages?*</span></p>
<div><img src="otq_E_074_files/otq_E_074-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:26pt;height:83pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">recent writer has truly said: “The summary want of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">age </span><span class="font4">is that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">last</span><span class="font4"> philosophy into which shall have been sifted al‘ other philosophy, which shall be at once catholic and eclecticl which shall be the joint growth and fruit of reason and faith, and which shall shed forth through every walk of research the blended light of discovery and revelation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many who admit that such a philosophy can emanate from God only, and that the Bible </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font4"> reveal it, nevertheless fail </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">find it there, because they do not seek it in an orderly or philosophical manner. Such we advise to read a book of 385 pages entitled “The Plan of the Ages,” which presents the soulsatisfying outlines of the divine plan of human redemption in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">form that is acceptable to humble and consecrated reason. Sold by us at cost—cloth bound, 25c, postpaid. This little tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">h a </span><span class="font4">crumb of its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of this book the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Constitution</span><span class="font5"> said editorially:— &nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ “ It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the great mysteries that have troubled us all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font5">lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside tha Church—outside the plan of salvation, and, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font5">Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">eternal torment and despair. We smother </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font5">feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be possible that the good mother and her wandering child are forever separated?—forever and forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">°I believe it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and skeptics—-makes Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave—a lost child, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">lost soul! ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This wonderful book makes no assertions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that are </span><span class="font5">not well sustained by the Scriptures. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is </span><span class="font5">built up stone by stone, and upon every stone </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love, and mercy, and wisdom. There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts upon which he throws a flood </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">light that dispels many dark and gloomy forebodings. I see that editors of leading journals, and many orthodox ministers of different denominations, have indorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation of God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort, for we are\all prisoners of hope. This is an age </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">advanced thought, and more thinking is done than ever before—men dare to think now. Light— more light, is the watchword.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">\ * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OUR GOD HAS A PLAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The careful and reverent student of the sacred Scriptures will find, in the light now due to the household of faith, that the Word of God presents </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">complete and systematic plan for the salvation and development of the human race, which for ages has been in operation, which, up to the present time, has been a success in its gradual development, and which in due time will be gloriously completed. The past six thousand years of human history have been necessary to work out that plan to its present degree of development, and one thousand years more will witness its full consummation in the res-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">titution of every willing member of the race to the original likeness, of God, and their establishment in righteousness, with the eternal ages of glory and blessing before them. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CHRIST THE CENTER OF THE PLAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such is the scope of God’s plan which he formed before the foundation of the world, to be wrought out in Christ, who is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last of Jehovah’s direct creation—his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font5"> begotten Son—Rev. 1:8, io; John 1:14, 18; Col. 1:13. “By him were all things made, and without him was not anything made that was made.” “ He is the image of the invisible .God, the first-born of every creature. By him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible; whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” (John 1:3; Col. 1:15, 17.) In him also * ‘ we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.”—Col. 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God, having thus honored his Son by making him his instrument or agent for the accomplishment of all his grand designs, declared to men: “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” He “hath exalted him to be a Prince and a Savior,” and “would have all men honor the Son (aS the Father’s agent and representative) even as they honor the Father.” (Matt. 17:5; Acts 5:31; John 5:23.) Nor does the Son.claim higher honor than to be the Father’s agent and messenger, “the messenger of the (Jehovah’s) covenant” (Mal. 3:1); for he says, “ I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me,” and “My Father is greater than I.” (John 6:38; 5:30; 4:34; 14:28.) To us, as to the Apostle, “there is one God, the Father, 0/ whom are all things; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font5"> whom are all things; and we by him.”—1 Cor. 8:6. &nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MAN IN. GOD’S IMAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the creation of angels came the creation of man, a being adapted to live on the earth and to be its lord and king. Man, as well as the angels, was created in the divine image—that is, with faculties of reason, conscience, etc., capable of discerning right and wrong. Man, as king of earth, and perfect, as created, was only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“a little lower</span><span class="font5"> than the angels” (Heb. 2:7, 9), and that little consisted in his being limited by his nature to the earth, while the angelic nature, being spiritual, has a wider range for observation and hence a broader plane for reasoning. To be an image of God implies freedom of choice or will with respect to one’s own conduct. With such freedom man was originally endowed by his Creator, and the alternatives of good and evil were placed before him as a necessity to his trial for lasting life, though not without warning on God’s part as to the blessed results of righteousness and the baneful results of evil. On ac</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">count of man’s inexperience, implicit obedience io God’s will was required of him for his safety and protection, as well as for a test of his loyalty to his rightful Lord and Sovereign. Nevertheless, God, by divine intuition, foresaw the course that Adam would take and the fall of the whole race with him into death, and also the lessons which that experience with sin and death might be overruled to teach them when, in due time, through the merit of Christ’s sacrifice, he would grant them remission of sins upon their repentance and turn to righteousness. He therefore determined to let man take his chosen course, and to inflict on him its just penalty, and then in due time to deliver him from it with a great salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">god’s</span><span class="font3"> FOREKNOWLEDGE GUIDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God foresaw that, even with good intentions, man’s limited knowledge and experience would continually offer temptations to doubt the wisdom of divine arrangements, if not to disobey them; he therefore' embraced this opportunity to convey to all of his creatures, as well as to man, a fuller conception of himself, in order that they might the more fully and heartily worship and obey him. As a revelation and illustration of his attributes— Justice, Wisdom, Power and Love—God placed his human son in his own image —perfect though inexperienced, and but slightly informed respecting his Creator’s attributes—on trial, in order that ~ he might gain a valuable experience, yet foreknowing that, although in every respect fairly tried, he would, in the use of his own free will, fall into sin. But God did not purpose to abandon his disobedient and death-deserving creature to eternal ruin, but provided a way of redemption whereby </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">might be just and yet the justifier of the truly penitent and believing (Rom. 3:26), so that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">painful experience gained under the reign of sin and death might eventually, under this overruling influence of divine providence, serve the more firmly to establish them in righteousness and willing loyalty to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trial in Eden was merely a test of obedience, or loyalty to\God. The fruit of the forbidden tree was good (forall the trees of the garden were good) and was desirable to make one wise; and had they proved their loyalty to God by obedience, probably the restriction would in due time have been removed. Knowledge is a blessing only to those who are subject to the divine will. This, God had arranged that man should acquire by experience, and angels by example. The penalty of man’s . disobedience was death—‘ ‘ In the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die.” The penalty was fulfilled to the letter: the dying began as soon as the penalty was pronounced, when they were cast out of Eden and restrained from eating its life-sustaining fruits; and it was completed within the thousand-year day, as predicted. (2 Pet. 3</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">:8.) </span><span class="font5">The penalty, death, being gradually and not sud-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">denly </span><span class="font5">inflicted left the condemned, pair free to propagate their species, yet subject to the weak</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ness </span><span class="font5">and all the penalty under which they themselves groaned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE FALL OF MAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, by one man’s disobedience, sin entered into </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">world, and death by (as a result of) sin; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font5">death passed upon all men, because all are sinners and imperfect by heredity.—Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sin, and death its penalty, by thus gaining con</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">trol </span><span class="font5">of Adam, controlled the world, and reigned </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font5">Adam to Moses—with but few divine promises, even, to illuminate the dark way. Then “the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">law came </span><span class="font5">by Moses,” offering lasting life to any one who would observe it in every particular. But </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">their fallen condition none of the condemned race was able to obey it, and by it to gain the reward of life. As God had designed, however, the law did serve a purpose: it served to show the helplessness of man for his own justification; and ' it served to point out, as from another than the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">corrupt </span><span class="font5">and condemned seed of Adam, the holy, harmless undefiled Lamb of God, whose sacrifice, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">Adam’s substitute or Redeemer, satisfied the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">claims of </span><span class="font5">justice, bought the world from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">slavery of </span><span class="font5">sin and death, and made possible the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gospel offer </span><span class="font5">of forgiveness and lasting life, not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">through our </span><span class="font5">righteousness in keeping God’s law </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(which is </span><span class="font5">impossible by reason of the weakness of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">flesh), but by our acceptance of Christ as our Master, and of his ransom-sacrifice as the satisfaction for our sins before God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &gt;&nbsp;DIVINE TIMES AND SEASONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">might be supposed that the work of blessing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">world should have begun at once when the sacrifice for sin was accepted by the Father, as signified by the giving of the spirit of adoption at Pentecost; but not so. Another feature of the divine plan had first to be accomplished, viz.: the selection and development of the Church to be joint heirs with Christ in his glory and kingdom and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">work of </span><span class="font5">blessing the world. This was from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">beginning a </span><span class="font5">part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the divine plan; and therefore </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">glorious reign and work of blessing the world could not begin at Christ’s resurrectioil, nor at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. Pentecost, </span><span class="font5">but had to be delayed until the selection </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">all its tried and faithful members could be accomplished. Or, to state it otherwise, the Father’s appointed time for blessing the world is during the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">seventh </span><span class="font5">thousand year, and had it not been for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">purpose to select the Church, the “bride” or “body&quot; of Christ, to share with him in the work </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">blessing the race, there need not have been two advents of our Lord. One would have been sufficient; for he could have come now, in the end of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">sixth thousand years, could have redeemed all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and at once </span><span class="font5">begun the great work of blessing and restoring mankind. He came to redeem the world . eighteen centuries previous to the appointed time of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Messing, so as to leave time, before that day, for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the selection of his bride from among the redeemed race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the occasion of man’s fall became God’s opportunity for exhibiting to all his creatures his wonderful character from every standpoint—his Justice, his Wisdom, his Power and his Love—so it also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font5">came an opportunity for the testing in all points </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">»f </span><span class="font5">his only begotten Son, preparatory to his yet higher exaltation (Phil. 2:8-10) to the divine nature, with all which that implies of glory, honor and immortality, and of position next to the Father, that all men should honor the Son even </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">they honor the Father. And the same occasion, as pre-arranged of God, also makes possible </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">calling, selection and trial of the Gospel Church, now soon to be completed and made joint-inheri-tors,'with our Lord and Savior, of glory, honor and immortality, and like him to be exalted far above men and angels, even to the divine nature—• 2 Pet. 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REVEALING DIVINE CHARACTER</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> of God’s character has yet been made manifest to the world, and much of its glory is sadly beclouded by human tradition, which falsely declares the wages of sin to be eternal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tor</span><span class="font5">ment instead of &quot;everlasting destruction.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> for his creatures, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wisdom of</span><span class="font5"> his plan of salvation, and his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font5"> to save, are as yet but partially revealed, and even distortedly seen </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by but </span><span class="font5">few indeed. God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justica</span><span class="font5"> has been revealed to aU for the past six thousand years in the reign </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">death, the penalty which he prescribed for sin. God's </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> began to be revealed eighteen hundred years </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">agoj,</span><span class="font5"> but not seeing all of the plan, few rightly appreciatied the love. Nevertheless &quot;In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent! his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font5">John 4:9.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wisdom pi</span><span class="font5"> the Lord’s plan will not be appreciated until thd Millennial Sun of Righteousness has arisen, revealing those features of his plan which then win </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">bring </span><span class="font5">blessings to all the billions which his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice </span><span class="font5">condemned, and which his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> redeemed. Bui the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font5"> of God will not be seen in its fulness </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font5">well on in that Millennial Day. Although partially revealed in the work of creation, the grandest and fullest exhibition remains to be shown in the resurrection from death of those redeemed ones, who, accepting of the gracious provisions of his love, bow in glad submission to all his just requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a </span><span class="font5">mistake made by many to suppose </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">Jehovah s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> and his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> are ever in conflict with each other. Both are perfect—his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> never desires or attempts what his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> does not endorse: his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> and his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> must both approve every act for which his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font5"> is exercised. With men, because of lack of wisdom and power, love and justice often conflict. Man’s love often has gracious designs which he has not the wisdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">power to accomplish except by violating justice. We must guage our views by the infinite and stay close to the revelation he makes of his plans, not seeking to make plans of our own for God. God’s plan, when clearly seen, fully vindicates his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice </span><span class="font5">as well as his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love.</span><span class="font5"> The plan of redemption devised by divine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wisdom</span><span class="font5"> is the essence of unfathomable </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> based upon uncompromising </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice,</span><span class="font5"> and will be fully accomplished by divine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power.</span><span class="font5"> The first act of God’s love was to provide a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font5"> for Adam, and thus for all his race, since it was by his transgression that all fell into sin and death. Until the ransom was given nothing was done in the way of saving the world: promises and types of coming salvation were made, but nothing more could be done. God had rendered a just sentence, and the penalty could not be set aside: it had to be met. Before Adam and his family could be released from the death sentence by a resurrection, the life of another man not under the sentence had to be paid as its corresponding price, that God might be just in justifying and accepting back to harmony and life all who believe in Jesus and turn unto God in his name. (Acts 4:12.) And having accepted Christ as the ransom of all such, the Apostle assures us that now “he is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faithful</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">just</span><span class="font5"> to forgive us ovr sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.’* —1 John 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">:g.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RECONCILIATION FOR BELIEVERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see, from God’s own declaration, that since Christ died for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, or rather, since </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">ascended up on high, and there appearing in the presence of God on our behalf presented the price </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">our redemption and became Lord of all, of both the living and the dead, there is no longer any legal hindrance in the way of the return of all mankind to fellowship with God, and to all the blessings and privileges lost under the penalty of the first transgression. The only difficulties remain</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font5">are on man’s part. In his fallen condition his mind is sick as well as his body. He inclines to believe falsely and is disinclined to believe in so great a salvation, such “good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people.’’ Besides, he is weak through the fall, and does those things which he often does not at heart approve and leaves undone much that at heart he really desires to do, and there is no help in himself. Some assistance </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fn </span><span class="font5">overcoming sinward tendencies must reach him or else the cancellation of past sin and the opportunity for reconciliation will be a valueless offer. \</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This necessity, which we recognize, is fully met/' </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">those features of the divine plan which are yet to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">fulfilled. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">who redeemed all is appointed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font5">both king and judge of all; for God “hath appointed a day in which he will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">judge the world</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font5">righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained,” Jesus Christ.

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>WHY EVIL WAS PERMITTED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">THE HARMONIOUS CO-OPERATION OF THE CREATOR'S WISDOM, JUSTICE, LOVE AND POWER WITNESSED THEREBY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evil is that which produces unhappiness; anything which either directly or remotely causes suffering of any kind.— </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Webster.</span><span class="font5"> This subject, therefore, not only inquires regarding human ailments, sorrows, pains, weaknesses and death, but goes back of all these to consider their primary cause—sin—and its remedy, Since sin is the cause of evil, its removal is the only method of permanently curing the malady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No difficulty, perhaps, more frequently preBents itself to the inquiring mind than the questions, Why did God permit the present reign of evil? Why did he permit Satan to present the temptation to our first parents, after having created them perfect and upright? Or why did he allow the forbidden tree to have a place among the good? Despite all attempts to turn it aside, the question will obtrude itself—Could not God have prevented all possibility of man’s fall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difficulty undoubtedly arises from a fail</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ure </span><span class="font5">to comprehend the plan of God. God could have prevented the entrance of sin, but the fact </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">he did not should be sufficient proof to us </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">its present permission is designed ultimately </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">work out some greater good. God’s plans, seen </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">their completeness, will prove the wisdom of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">course pursued. Some inquire, Could not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font5">with whom all things are possible, have interfered in season to prevent the full accomplish</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ment of </span><span class="font5">Satan’s design? Doubtless </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">could; but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">such' </span><span class="font5">interference would have prevented the accomplishment of his own purposes. His purpose </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">to make manifest the perfection, majesty and righteous authority of his law, and to prove both </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">men and to angels the evil consequences result</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font5">from its violation. Besides, in their very nature, some things are impossible even with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font5">as the Scriptures state. It is &quot;impossible for God to lie” (Heb.6:i8). &quot;He cannot deny himself’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 </span><span class="font5">Tim. 2:13). He cannot do wrong, and therefore </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">could not choose any but the wisest and best plan for introducing his creatures into life, even though our short-sighted vision might for a time fail to discern the hidden springs of infinite wis</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures declare that all things were created for the Lord’s pleasure (Rom. 4:11) — without doubt, for the pleasure of dispensing his blessings, and of exercising the atttributes of his glorious being. And though, in the working out of his benevolent designs, he permits evil and evil doers for a time to play an active part, yet it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">not for evil’s sake, nor because he is in league with sin; for he declares that he is &quot;&nbsp;not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness.” (Psa. 5:4.) Though opposed to evil in every sense, God </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">permits (i. e., </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">does </span><span class="font5">not hinder) it for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">time, because his wisdom sees a way in which it may be made a lasting and valuable lesson to his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ft is a self-evident truth that for every right principle there is a corresponding wrong princi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ple;, </span><span class="font5">as, for instance, truth and falsity, love and hatred, justice and injustice. We distinguish </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font5">opposite principles as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wrong,</span><span class="font5"> by their effects wheh put in action. That principle the result of which, when active, is beneficial and productive of ultimate order, harmony and happiness, we call a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font5"> principle; and the opposite, which is productive of discord, unhappiness and destruction, we call a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font5"> principle. The results of these principles in action we call </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">good </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">evil;</span><span class="font5"> and the intelligent being, capable of discerning the right principle from the wrong, and voluntarily governed by the one or the other, we call virtuous or sinful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This faculty of discerning between right and wrong principles is called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the moral sense,</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">conscience.</span><span class="font5"> It is by this moral sense which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God has </span><span class="font5">given to man that we are able </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">judge of God </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">to recognize that he is good. It is to this moral sense that God always appeals to prove his righteousness or justice; and by the same moral sense Adam could discern sin, or unrighteousness, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">evil,</span><span class="font5"> even before he knew all its consequences. The lower orders of God’s creatures are not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font5">dowed with this moral sense. A dog has some </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font5">telligence, but not to this degree, though he may learn that certain actions bring the approval and reward of his master, and certain others his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dis</span><span class="font5">approval. He might steal or take life, but would not be termed a sinner; or he might protect </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">prop</span><span class="font5">erty and life, but would not be called virtuous— because he is ignorant of the moral quality of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God could have made mankind devoid </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font5">ability to discern between right and wrong, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">able only to discern and to do right; but to have made him so would have been to make merely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">living machine, and certainly not a mental image of his Creator. Or he might have made man perfect and a free agent, as he did, and have guarded him from Satan’s temptation. In that case, man’s experience being limited to good, he would havej been continually liable to suggestions of evil from without, or to ambitions from within, which would have made the everlasting future uncertain, and an outbreak of disobedience and disorder might always have been a possibility, besides which, good would never have been so highly appreciated except by its contrast with evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God first made his creatures acquainted with good, surrounding them with it in Eden; and afterward, as a penalty for disobedience, he gave them a severe knowledge of evil. Expelled from Eden and deprived of fellowship with himself, God let them experience sickness, pain and death, that they might thus forever know evil and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font5">expediency and exceeding sinfulness of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By a comparison of results they came to an appreciation and proper estimate of both; &quot;And the Lord said, Behold, the man is become as one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">us, to know good and evil.” (Gen. 3:22.) In this their posterity share, except that they first obtain their knowledge of evil, and cannot fully realize what good is until they experience it in the Millennium, as a result of their redemption by him who will then be their Judge and King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The moral sense, or judgment of right and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">wrong-, and the liberty to use it, which Adam possessed, were important features of his likeness to God. The law of right and wrong was written in his natural constitution. It was a part of his nature, just as it is a part of the divine nature. But let us not forget that this image or likeness of God, this originally law inscribed nature of man, has lost much of its clear outline through the srasing, degrading influence of sin; hence it is not now what it was in the first man. Ability to love implies ability to hate; hence we may reason that the Creator could not make man in his own likeness, with power to love and to do right, without the corresponding ability to hate and to do wrong. .This liberty of choice, termed free moral agency, or free will, is a part of man’s original endowment; and this, together with the full measure of his mental and moral faculties, constituted him an image of his Creator. Today, after six thousand years of degradation, so much of the original likeness has been erased by sin that we are not free, being bound, to a greater or less extent, by sin and its entailments, so that sin is now more easy and therefore more agreeable to the fallen race than is righteousness. $*1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That God could have given Adam such a vivid impression of the many evil results of sin as would have deterred him from it, we need not question, but we believe that God foresaw, that an actual experience of the evil would be the surest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">.most lasting lesson to serve man eternally; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">for that reason God did not prevent put permitted man to take his choice, and to feel the consequences of evil. Had opportunity to sin never </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font5">permitted, man could not have resisted </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it, </span><span class="font5">consequently there would have been neither virtue </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font5">merit in his right doing. God seeketh such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">worship him as worship in spirit and in truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">desires intelligent and willing obedience, rather than ignorant, mechanical service. He already had in operation inanimate mechanical agencies accomplishing his will, but his design was to make a nobler thing, an intelligent creature in his own likeness, a lord for earth, whose loyalty and righteousness would be based upon an appreciation of right and wrong, of good and evil. &lt;he principles of right and wrong, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">principles, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">always existed, and must always exist; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">perfect, intelligent creatures in God’s likeness must be free to choose either, though the right principle </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font5"> will forever continue to be active. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">Scriptures inform us that when the activity of the evil principle has been permitted long enough to accomplish God's purpose, it will forever cease to be active, and that all who continue </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">submit to its control shall forever cease to ex</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ist. </span><span class="font5">(i Cor. 15:25, 26; Heb.2:i4.) Right-doing and right-doers, only, shall continue forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But the </span><span class="font5">question recurs </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">another form: Could </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">man have been made acquainted with evil in some other way than by experience ? There are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">four </span><span class="font5">ways of knowing things, namely, by intuition, by observation, by experience, and by information received through sources accepted as positively truthful. An intuitive knowledge would be a^flirect apprehension, without the process of reasoning, or the necessity for proof. Such knowledge belongs only to the^divine Jehovah, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">eternal fountain of all wisdom and truth, who, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">necessity and in the very nature of things, is superior to all his creatures. Therefore, man’s knowledge of good and evil could not be intuitive, Man’s knowledge might have come by observation, but in that event there must needs have been some exhibition of evil and its results for man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to ob</span><span class="font5">serve. This would imply the permission of evil somewhere, among some beings, and why not as well among men, and upon the earth, as among others.elsewhere? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should not man be the illustration, and get his knowledge by practical experience? It </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">so: man is gaining a practical experience, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">furnishing an illustration </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">others as well, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">being </span><span class="font5">&quot;made a spectacle to angels.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>s</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The severity of the penalty was not a display </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">hatred and malice on God’s part, but the necessary and inevitable, final result of evil, which God thus allowed man to see and feel. God can sustain life as long as he sees fit, even against the destructive power of actual evil; but it would be as impossible for God to sustain such a life everlastingly, as it is for God to lie. That is, it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">morally impossible.</span><span class="font5"> Such a life could only become more and more a source of unhappiness to itself and others; therefore, God is too good to sustain an existence so useless and injurious to itself and others, and, his sustaining power being withdrawn, destruction, the natural result </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of evil, </span><span class="font5">would ensue. Life is a favor, a gift of God, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">it will be continued everlastingly only to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">obedient. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No injustice has been done to Adam’s posterity in not affording them each an individual trial. Jehovah was in no sense bound to bring us into existence ; and, having brought us into being, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">law of equity or justice binds him to perpetuate our being everlastingly, nor even to grant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">us a </span><span class="font5">trial under promise of everlasting life if obedient. Mark this point well: The present life, which from the cradle to the tomb is but a process </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">dying, is, notwithstanding all its evils and disappointments, a boon, a favor, even if there were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">hereafter. .iThe large majority so esteem it, the exceptions (suicides) being comparatively few; and these our courts of justice have repeatedly decided to be mentally unbalanced, as otherwise they would not thus cut themselves off from present blessings. Besides, the conduct of the perfect man, Adam, shows us what the conduct </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">his children would have been under similar </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cir</span><span class="font5">cumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. <sup>F</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have imbibed the erroneous idea that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">placed our race on trial for life with the alternative of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">eternal torture,</span><span class="font5"> whereas nothing of the kind is even hinted at in the penalty. The favor or blessing of God to his obedient children is life— continuous life—free from pain, sickness and every other element of decay and death. Adam was given this blessing in the full measure, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">warned that he would be deprived of this &quot;gift” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font5">he failed to render obedience to God—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In the day </span><span class="font5">that thou eatest thereof, dying, thou shalt </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">die.” </span><span class="font5">He knew nothing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font5"> in torment as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pen</span><span class="font5">alty of sin. 'Life everlasting is nowhere </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">promised </span><span class="font5">to any but the obedient. Life is God’s gift, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Those who do not receive a full knowledge and, by faith, an enjoyment of this favor of God in the present time (and such are the great majority, including children and heathen) will assuredly have these privileges in the next age, or &quot;world to come,” the dispensation or age to follow the present. To this end, &quot;all that are in their graves . . . shall come forth.” As each one (whether in this age or the next) becomes fully aware of the ransom-price given by our Lord Jesus, and of his subsequent privileges, he is considered as on trial, as Adam was; and obedience brings lasting life, and disobedience ~ lasting death—the &quot;second death.” Perfect obedience, however, without perfect ability </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;0 </span><span class="font5">render it, is not required of any. Under the New Covenant the members of the Church during the Gospel age, have had the righteousness of Christ imputed to them by faith, to make up their unavoidable deficiencies through the weaknesses of the flesh ; and this same grace will operate toward &quot;whosoever will” of the world during the Millennial age. Not until physical perfection is reached (which will be the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">privilege of</span><span class="font5"> all before </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">close of the Millennial age) will absolute moral perfection be expected. This new trial, the result of the ransom and the New Covenant, will differ from the trial in Eden, in that in it the acts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">each one will affect only his own future. <sup>1</sup> *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But would not this be giving some of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">race </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font5"> chance to gain everlasting life? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W« </span><span class="font5">answer—The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font5"> chance for ev rlasting life was lost for himself and all of his race, &quot;yet in his loins,” by father Adam’s disobedience. Under that original trial &quot;condemnation passed upon all men;” and God’s plan -. as that through Christ’s redemption-sacrifice Adam, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> who lost life in his failure, hould, after having tasted of the exceeding .infulness of sin and felt the weight of sin’s penalty, be given the opportunity to turn unto God through faith in the Redeemer. If anyone choose to call this a &quot;second .hance,” let him do so: itmust certainly be Adam's ~econd chance, and in a sense at least it is the same for all of the ’redeemed race, but it will be the first </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">individual </span><span class="font5">opportunity of his descendants, who, when born, were already under condemnation to death. «Call it what we please, the facts are the same; viz., All were sentenced to death because of Adam’s disobedience, and all will enjoy (in this life or the next) a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">full opportunity</span><span class="font5"> to gain everlasting life under the favorable terms of the New Covenant. This, as the angels declared, is &quot;Good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people.” And, as the Apostle declared, this grace of God—that our Lord Jesus &quot;gave himself a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ransom for all,&quot;— </span><span class="font5">must be &quot;testified” to all &quot;in due time.” (Rom. S<sup>:I</sup>7'<sup>r</sup>9; 1 Tim. 2:4-6.) Men, not God, have limited to the Gospel age this chance or opportunity of attaining life. God, on the contrary, tells us that the Gospel age is merely for the selection of the Church, the royal priesthood, through whom, during a succeeding age, all others shall be brought to an accurate knowledge of the Truth and granted full opportunity to secure everlasting life under the New Covenant. J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what advantage is there in the method pur-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">death, the opposite of life, is the penalty he prescribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eternal torture is nowhere suggested in the Old Testament Scriptures, and only a few statements in the New Testament can be so misconstrued as to appear to teach it: and these are found either among the symbolisms of Revelation, or among the parables and dark sayings of our Lord, which were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not understood,</span><span class="font5"> by the people who heard them (Luke 8:io), and which seem to be but little better comprehended today.* &quot;The wages of sin is death.” (Rom. 6:23.) &quot;The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”—Ezek. 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦Many have supposed God unjust in allowing Adam’s condemnation to be shared Lydiis posterity, instead of granting each one a trial and chance for everlasting life similar to that which Adam enjoyed. But what will such say if it now be shown that the world’s opportunity and trial for life will be much more favorable than was Adam’s; and that, too, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font5"> God adopted this plan of permitting Adam’s race to share his penalty in a natural way ? We believe this to be the case, and will endeavor to make it plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God assures us that as condemnation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">passed upon</span><span class="font5"> all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font5"> Adam, so he has arranged for a new head, father or life-giver for the race, into whom all may be transferred by faith ; and that as all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in </span><span class="font5">Adam shared the curse of death, so all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font5"> Christ will share the blessing of life, being justified by faith in his blood. (Rom. 5:12, 18, 19.) Thus seen, the death of Jesus, the undefiled, the sinless one, was a complete settlement toward God of the sin of Adam. As one man had sinned, and all in him had shared his curse, his penalty, so Jesus, having paid the penalty of that one sinner, bought not only Adam but all of his posterity,— all men—who by heredity shared his weaknesses and sins and the penalty of these,—death. Our Lord, &quot;the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font5"> Christ Jesus,” himself unblemished, approved, and with a perfect seed or race in him, unborn, likewise untainted with sin, gave his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all of</span><span class="font5"> human life and title as the full </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ransomprice</span><span class="font5"> for Adam and the race or seed in him when sentenced. Having thus fully purchased the lives of Adam and his race, Christ offers to adopt as his seed, his children, all of Adam’s race who will accept the terms of his New Covenant and thus £y faith come into his family—the family of God—and receive everlasting life. Thus the Redeemer will &quot;&nbsp;see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his seed</span><span class="font5"> [as many of Adam’s seed as will accept </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">adoption,</span><span class="font5"> upon his conditions] and prolong his days [resurrection to a higher than human plane, being granted him by the Father as a reward for his obedience],” and all in the most unlikely way : by the sacrifice of life and posterity. And thus it is written : &quot;As all in Adam die, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">even so</span><span class="font5"> all in Christ shall be made alive.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Corrected translation,</span><span class="font5"> I Cor. 15:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The injury we received through Adam’s fall (we suffered no injustice) is, by God’s favor to be more than offset with favor through Christ; and all will sooner or later (in God’s &quot;duetime”) have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">full opportunity to be restored to the same standing that Adam enjoyed before he sinned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sued? Why </span><span class="font5">not give all men an individual chance——destruction—cutting off from life. God thus lint-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for life now, </span><span class="font5">at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">once, </span><span class="font5">without the long process of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Adam’s </span><span class="font5">trial and condemnation, the share by his offspring in his condemnation, the redemption of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">aH 4&gt;y </span><span class="font5">Christ’s sacrifice, and the new offer to all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">everlasting life upon the New Covenant condi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tions? If </span><span class="font5">evil must be permitted because of man’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">free </span><span class="font5">moral agency, why </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">its extermination </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ac</span><span class="font5">complished by such a peculiar and circuitous </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">method? </span><span class="font5">Why allow so much misery to intervene, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and to </span><span class="font5">come upon many who will ultimately re</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ceive the </span><span class="font5">gift of life as obedient children of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ah! that is the point on which interest in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">subject </span><span class="font5">centers. Had God ordered differently the propagation of our species, so that children would </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">partake of the results of parental sins—weak</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nesses, </span><span class="font5">mental, moral and physical—and had the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Creator </span><span class="font5">so arranged that all should have a favor</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">able </span><span class="font5">Edenic condition for their testing, and that transgressors only should be condemned and &quot;cut </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">off,” </span><span class="font5">how many might we presume would, under all those favorable conditions, be found worthy, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">how many unworthy of life? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the one instance of Adam be taken as a criterion (and he certainly was in every respect a sample of perfect manhood), the conclusion would </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">b® </span><span class="font5">that none would have been found perfectly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">obedient </span><span class="font5">and worthy; because none would possess </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. that </span><span class="font5">clear knowledge of and experience with God, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font5">would develop in them full confidence in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his, </span><span class="font5">laws, beyond their personal judgment. We </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">assured that it was Christ’s knowledge of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Father </span><span class="font5">that enabled him to trust and obey impli</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">citly. </span><span class="font5">(Isa. 53:11.) But let us suppose that onefourth would gain life; or even more, suppose that one-half were found worthy, and that the other </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">half </span><span class="font5">would suffer the wages of sin,—death. Then </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">what? </span><span class="font5">Let us suppose the other half, the obedient, had neither experienced nor witnessed sin: might they not forever feel a curiosity toward things forbidden, only restrained through fear of God and of the penalty? Their service could not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">so hearty as though they knew good and evil; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">hence had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">full appreciation of the benevolent designs of the Creator in making the laws which govern his own course as well as the course </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">his creatures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> Then, too, consider the half that would thus go </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font5">death as the result of their own wilful sin. They would be lastingly cut off from life, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font5">only hope would be that God would in love remember them as his creatures, the work of his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hands, </span><span class="font5">and provide another trial for them. But </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">why </span><span class="font5">do so? The only reason would be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">hope that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font5">they were re-awakened and tried again, some of them, by reason of their larger </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">experience, </span><span class="font5">might then choose obedience and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But even if such a plan were as good in its results as the one God has adopted, there would be serious objections to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How much more like the wisdom of God to con</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fine </span><span class="font5">sin to certain limits, as his plan does. How much better even our finite minds can discern it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">be, to have but one perfect and impartial law, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font5">declares the wages of wilful sin to be death</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">its the evil which he permits, by providing that the Millennial reign of Christ shall accomplish the full extinction of evil and also of wilful evildoers, and usher in an eternity of righteousness, based upon full knowledge and perfect free-will obedience by perfect beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who can appreciate this feature of God’s plan, which, by condemning all in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font5"> representative, opened the way for the ransom and restitution of all by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font5"> Redeemer, will find in it the solution of many perplexities. They will see that the condemnation of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> in one was the reverse </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">an injury: it was a great favor to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> when taken in connection with God’s plan for providing justification for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> through another one’s sacrifice. Evil will be forever extinguished when God’s purpose in permitting it shall have been accomplished, and when the benefits of the ransom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">made co-extensive with the penalty of sin/ It </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">impossible, however, to appreciate rightly this feature of the plan of God without a full recognition of the sinfulness of sin, the nature of its penalty—death, the importance and value of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font5"> which our Lord Jesus gave, and the positive and complete restoration of the individual </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">favorable conditions, conditions under which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">will have full and ample trial, before being adjudged worthy of the reward (lasting life), </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">of the penalty (lasting death).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the great plan of redemption, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">the consequent &quot;restitution of all things,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font5">Christ, we can see that blessings result through the permission of evil which, probably, could </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">otherwise have been so fully realized. »</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only are men benefitted to all eternity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">the experience gained, and angels by their observation of man’s experiences, but all are further advantaged by a fuller acquaintance with God's character as manifested in his plan. When his plan is fully accomplished, all will be able to read clearly his wisdom, justice, love and power. They will see the justice which could not violate the divine decree, nor save the justly condemned race without a full cancellation of their penalty by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">willing Redeemer. They will see the love which provided this noble sacrifice and which highly exalted the Redeemer to God’s own right hand, giving him power and authority thereby to restore to life those whom he had purchased witlr his precious blood. They will also see the power and wisdom which were able to work out a glorious destiny for his creatures, and so to overrule every opposing influence as to make them either the willing or the unwilling agents for the advancement and final accomplishment of his grand designs. Had evil not been permitted and thus overruled by divine providence, we cannot </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5">how these results could have been attained. The permission of evil for a time among men thus displays a far-seeing wisdom, which grasped all the attendant circumstances, devised the remedy, and marked the final outcome through his power and grace.</span></p>

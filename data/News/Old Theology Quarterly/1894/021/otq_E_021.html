<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD TO TRUE CHRISTIANS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">blessed ark they that hunger and thirst after</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> RIGHTEOUS* NESS </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[truth in thought, word and deed]</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; FOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THEY SHALL BE FILLED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Overcharged, as many Christian people are, with the cares of this life, and intoxicated, as some others are, with its fleeting pleasures, it is quite possible that a very large majority fail to discern the peculiar signs of these times, which the Scriptures show to be a transition period, closing the gospel age and ushering in the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We live in a day when many, even in the pulpit, as well as out of it, are boldly contradicting the Bible and denying its divine authorship, in whole or in part; and never in the history of the Church have so many conflicting voices confused the truths of the Gospel. We are told that the prophets and apostles, though honest, were mistaken or fanatical men who made serious errors in what they said and wrote: that even our Lord Jesus was mistaken in much that he said,—as, for instance, in his references to Jonah and the great fish, to Noah and the deluge, etc. (Matt. 12:40; 24: 37-39; Luke 17 : 26,27.) What is termed the higher criticism of the Bible rejects all such statements, including miracles and prophecies, as generally absurdities, unworthy of the credence of thinking men ; and it accepts merely the moral precepts, whatever of the historical portions suits its convenience, etc., as from any other book. This great “ falling away ” was predicted for the end of this age, and it therefore becomes another sign of the times. Note carefully the following Scriptures, which indicate that a thousand will thus fall (into unbelief), to one who will stand faithful. Let all who would stand seek quickly and put on “ the whole armor of God, that ye may be .able to withstand in the evil day.”—Psa. 91: 7,11,12; Luke 18:8; 2 Tim,3:l; Eph.6:i3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yet, in the midst of all the confusing voices of this “evil day,” the Lord’s sheep will hear the voice of the Good Shepherd, and, following him, will not be left in the outer darkness of doubt and unbelief, but will _ be guided into all the truth now due to the household of faith. Such was his promise; and such should be the expectation of his people, especially now, when “ the whole armor of God,”—the full understanding and clear appreciation of the divine plan—is needed as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Write to us at onee, if you feel a hunger and thirst for the bread of life and the living water; for Luke 12:37 is now being fulfilled. We send sample tracts and papers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font2"> to applicants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We earnestly commend to God’s people the careful and prayerful reading of a work which we publish at cost price in order to bring it within the reach of even the poorest. It is entitled Millennial Dawn. Over 400,000 copies are already in circulation in various languages, and a blessing is going out therefrom to God’s consecrated people. -</span></p>

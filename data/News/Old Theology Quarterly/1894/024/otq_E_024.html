<p><span class="font7">— AND —</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">NEEDFUL JjELPS THERETO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our Redeemer prayed for his disciples— “ Sanctify them through thy truth and then added, “ Thy Word is truth.” (John 17: 17.) He thus showed us a general principle, and one which experience demonstrates—that God’s truth is his agency for developing his children. Not general truths, however good and beautiful, such as botany, astronomy, etc., but truths which God reveals in his Word, are those which tend to produce in us, if we heartily receive them, the graces of God’s spirit—the spirit of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the questions arise—“ What is God’s truth?’ ’ “What is God’s Word?” For it will be remembered that at the time our Lord said, “Thy Word is truth,” the New Testament had not been written. It does not follow, however, that our Lord meant that the Law and the Prophets (the Old Testament) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">alone</span><span class="font11"> were to be considered the Word of God adapted and intended to sandtifyus; but, rather, that all that God had caused tp be written by the prophets, together with all the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">explanations</span><span class="font11"> of those Old Testament writings which God would supply through Christ’s teachings, and afterward through the writings of the’apostles, were to be esteemed as God’s Word—revelations of truth which would sandtify those who believe them and who adt accordingly. This he clearly showed when he declared, “ My dodtrine is not mine, but his that sent me“ The words that I speak unto you, they are&gt; spirit and they ar* life;” “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth, and he will </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">show you things to eome.&quot;—</span><span class="font11">John 7: 16; 6: 63; 16: 12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It will be seen, therefore, at once, that the opinion of many, that the prophecies of the Old Testament are all fulfilled and not now worthy of reverent study, is a great mistake —a serious mistake, because it blinds many to the great and beautiful promises therein revealed which are still future and vitally associated with the true Christian faith and hope, and therefore essential to complete sandiification. Of these, first in prominence are the promises of Christ’s Millennial Kingdom and of the great blessings which shall accrue to the world of mankind, and to the earth as man’s future home, of pleasing prospedt and bountifully teeming with luxuries and comforts for the willingly obedient. Second are the promises to Israel of a restoration to divine favor and to a share in the Millennial work of blessing (educating, ruling and lifting up) mankind—promises which state as well as imply that the old patriarchs. are to be restored to life as perfect men, to be examples of what </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font11"> manhood is and of what all the fallen race </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font11"> attain unto by obeying the Lord Jesus, then, with his Church, the Ruler of earth.' —Adis 3 : 19—22 ; 7 : 37 ; 1 Cor. 6 : 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Indeed, it is largely because of a failure to appreciate the Old Testament prophecies, that so many of God’s children have gotten so sadly mixed on all the teachings of the New Testament—shown by the conflicting creeds of Christendom. The apostles were continually referring to the statements of the prophets and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">interpreting them,</span><span class="font11"> and reasoning from that basis. (See, for instances, Adis 2: 24-32; 3: 19-22; Rom. 11 : 2, 8, 9; Gal. 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From the prophecies they deduced and stated conclusions regarding the Lord’s will in the present age and declared his future purposes. (See Rom. 11 : 25-32; Adis 15 : 14-16.) No wonder, then, that those who ignore the Old Testament should but dimly understand the arguments of the New Testament which are based upon those previous revelations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">YOU WILL REQUIRE ASSISTANCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are intelledlually bright, and have large perceptive and - refledtive powers and a good education, you can take the Biljle, and by years of patient, critical study, you may proye to your satisfaction its divine inspiration and greatness from its internal as well as its external evidence, and acquire much of its wisdom and truth. But have you all these advantages? And if so, have you at your&quot;command the years of time needful to their use? Most of the earnest truth-seekers have not; and even if they all had, would it not be an evident waste of time for each to study out this subjedl independently of each other one? We do not do so in other sciences, but make use of each other’s assistance—not, however, without proving what we accept, with our best reasoning faculties. And so we should do in Bible study. And evidently it is the Lord’s will that we should do so, since through the Apostle Paul- he shows the mutual dependence, one upon another, of the various members of the Church, though some may be specially useful to the body, as eye or as right hand members.—iCor. 12 :14-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SCRIPTURES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many able and valuable works upon this subject are obtainable through any bookseller, or in any public library; but the most of these are written in a style for the scholarly only, and, filling several volumes, require more time than many are able to give for such information; and hence few of the masses of the people know, as they ought, the firm foundation which God’s Word really affords for their faith. As a result,' many have but little faith in the Bible and are often ashamed of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But we wish to call your attention to a very brief and pointed treatise on this subject—one which you can digest in a few hours, and which will strengthen your faith in God’s Word for the remainder of your life. It is contained in the first three chapters of a book entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“ The Plan of the Ages.&quot;</span><span class="font11"> Whatever else you may or may not have read, you should read the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">pointed</span><span class="font11"> arguments there presented. And as parents and as Christians you should assist the young and the many who are skeptically inclined in this day of doubts, and help them to get settled and grounded upon the Bible as God’s Word. In the cas’e of your own children this is specially a duty that you owe them. And in the case of others, remember that, in God’s sight, we are each our brother’s keeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ONLY THE MEEK WILL BE TAUGHT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When satisfied that the Bible is really God’s Word and intended to be the guide of his children, a lamp to our feet, while we walk by faith and not by sight, until the Millennial Day dawns, you will want to study it. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">How shall you begin ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Begin as you would with any other study—systematically. The first requisite is a guileless heart—a simple hearj—one not too wise to be instructed—a heart that realizes that the information it seeks can come from God alone, that human wisdom is insufficient—a heart that is ready “as a little child” to be taught of God. “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” (Psa. 25 19.) Because ‘<sup>1</sup> God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.” (Jas. 4:6.) Such, then, must all be who would be “ taught of God.” Others will fail to understand God’s Word ; for he has arranged it so that others shall not understand it.—Dan. 12:10; Matt. 13:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Again, the Apostle says, “ Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman who needeth not to be ashamed—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—2 </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Tim.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2 :15.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To rightly divide the Word of truth, you should be shown how by some one who has learned how, otherwise you will find it a tedious and laborious task, costing precious years. And, alas 1 we regret to have it to say that few of God’s children have learned this secret of Bible study, and'few, therefore, can aid you to any considerable degree. Instead of recognizing the various ages and dispensations —the Patriarchal age, the Jewish age, the Christian age and “ the Ages to Come ”—and seeing the work God is gradually perfecting through these ages, they think of God’s dealings as almost aimless and without order. Hence, instead of rightly dividing and applying the various statements of Scripture severally to the various ages and dispensations to which they properly belong, they mix them all together and have a disorderly and seemingly contradictory mass which they cannot understand and can scarcely realize to be a revelation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But, on the contrary, when the various ages are clearly in mind, and when the plan of God with reference to them is once seen, the Bible becomes an open book before the humble student—a great treasure-house of truth and grace, every statement of which can be definitely located^ And when rightly applied to its proper age—past, present or future, as the case may be—the whole record from Genesis to Revelation falls into harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a help in the direction of the right dividing of God’s Word, we commend the book whose first three chapters we have already referred to, whose name, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“ The Plan of the Ages,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> indicates but slightly its value as an exponent of the way in which the Word of God should be rightly divided —dispensationally—in order to be “ meat in due season ” to the household of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The foundation here laid, in an understanding of God’s dispensational dealings, will lead the mind of the earnest student into green pastures of spiritual refreshment and strength, and open the way to and into “ the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">deep things</span><span class="font11"> of God,” both of knowledge and experience. Begin, then, with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">study</span><span class="font11"> (not a reading merely) of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“The Plan of the Ages,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> and then go on unto perfection. The foundation properly laid in a heart-felt dfesire to know and obey God’s Word, and an outline of the ages in mind, your building up in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">most holy faith,</span><span class="font11"> and with truths which will satisfy you wholly, will be an easy task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD, </span><span class="font11">should be well sharpened. That is to say, you will want a Bible with marginal references. If you can afford it, you should get what is termed a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Teachers'’ Bible,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> which gives not only the text of the com'mon version, and references, and marginal readings, but also an Index of Bible topics, a partial Concordance, a partial Dictionary of Bible names, places, etc., as well as maps and much other useful general informati’on. Then you will want one or both of the—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TWO GREAT BIBLE CONCORDANCES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The best Concordance for finding the location of a passage of Scripture quickly is the old, reliable </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cruderi's Concordance.</span><span class="font11"> Beware, however, of its theological definitions : they are very erroneous, unscriptural, and hence misleading if trusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the most valuable in another way (though a passage cannot be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">found</span><span class="font11"> so quickly in it as in Cruden’s) is the justly celebrated work of recent years, known as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young's Greek, Hebrew and English Analytical Concordance.</span><span class="font11"> The author, Professor Young, of Edinburgh, Scotland, a ripe scholar of now world-wide fame, has here given to God’s children (many of whom have little or no knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages in which the Bible was written), a quick and ready means of ascertaining what Greek or Hebrew word was used in any particular place, and the meaning of that word as defined by Prof. Young: and the meaning may be judged still more accurately by running the eye down the column and thus comparing the various uses of the same word in other passages. All should have one of these Concordances. All who can afford it should have both— Cruden’s for quick general use, and Young’s for critical examination of any word or passage ; but the latter is preferable, if you get only the one. Then you will </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">need,</span><span class="font11"> also,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE EMPHATIC DIAGLOTT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is another of God’s special blessings for our day ; and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font11"> the foregoing described helps is worth more than a four years’ course in the Greek and Hebrew languages. First, it gives the Greek text for the Greek scholar. Second, it gives immediately under the Greek text a literal translation of it, word for word. Third, it gives in another column a smooth English translation suitable for common reading, showing also the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">emphasis</span><span class="font11"> of the Greek, usually lost to English readers. While we cannot say that this work is perfeCt, we can say that we know of no other translation of the New Testament so valuable to the critical student—and this includes all to whom we write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The above, with the various volumes of the Millennial Dawn series, of which </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘'The Plan of the Ages”</span><span class="font11"> is the first, really constitute an outfit of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">needful</span><span class="font11"> helps. But if you have the means to spare, or if you can deny yourself in some other way, you will also find the following very useful:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(i.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham's Translation of the New Testament. </span><span class="font11">This is in many respedts an excellent translation, and, besides, has marks showing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">emphasis</span><span class="font11"> of the Greek, not shown in the common English translations. It is valuable, as any translation is, for critical study of a text. A comparison of the different methods of expression gives the thought of the original more clearly to the studious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser's Translation of the Old Testament.</span><span class="font11"> This, too, is valuable. It is a translation by an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">unconverted </span><span class="font11">llebrew, who certainly has no bias favorable toward Christianity. This is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">recognized</span><span class="font11"> translation among the Hebrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3.) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hot general</span><span class="font11"> information upon religious subjects (not for dodtrinal instruction, though it contains a brief </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">history of</span><span class="font11"> all doCtrines and religions), we commend to you a Bible Dictionary. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Smith’s Bible Dictionary</span><span class="font11"> is justly popular, and though we cannot endorse its theological definitions, the work is valuable and instructive aside from these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NOW, ANOTHER WORD-STUDY PRAYERFULLY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Study of the Bible should never be attempted in any but a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">prayerful</span><span class="font11"> attitude of mind. It should be remembered that the nearer our hearts and lives come into sympathy and union with our God, the more receptive of truth we will be, and the more ready to understand it. Therefore while studying pray without ceasing; let your hearts continually thank the Lord for every item of truth you may see, no matter who or what has been his helping hand to lead you to it and make it plain ; and ever be desirous of knowing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> that God has to reveal. Be cautious, too, lest you should allow prejudice to keep you from simplicity of mind; and also lest Satan, through any man or woman or teaching, should beguile you into error after you have gotten free from prejudice and out into God’s sunlight. Our constant prayer should be,—Be thou my teacher, Lord, and use thou whom or what thou wilt in giving me the lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Make sure, however, if even an angel from heaven preach to you any other gospel than that founded upon </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Christ crucified,</span><span class="font11"> that you reject it as spurious. (Gal. i:8.) AIL gospels which reject the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">blood</span><span class="font11"> (death) of Christ as the basis of reconciliation and blessing come not from God, whoever may present them, or in however pleasant words they may be put to you. They are from the great adversary and deceiver, the devil, whoever may be his willing or unwitting agents, or whatever his agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But avoid the mistaken idea of some, that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">prayer</span><span class="font11"> takes the place of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">study.</span><span class="font11"> Prayer may and should co-operate with study in relation to God’s Word, but it cannot take its place any more than in mathematics or astronomy. Hence, if you feel prompted by spiritual laziness or habit, or what' not, to pray to God to give you a knowledge of his Word and plan without patient, earnest study and the use of the various helps which he has provided, reflect that you are not justified in asking God to give you in a miraculous manner, of your own choosing, what he has already put within your reach in another manner, which is his choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Reflect, too, that before asking God to do a miracle for your instruction, you should learn obedience; and that he has said to you and to us all, “Study” (2 Tim. 2:15), “ Search the Scriptures.”—John 5 :3g.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">HOW HELPS MAY BECOME HINDRANCES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Beware how you permit any man’s thinking to take the place of your own. God does indeed make use of one and another of his children in pointing out to others the meaning of his Word. But, while humbly and thankfully making use of any helper’s assistance and esteeming such very highly in the Lord for their work’s sake, we want to remember not to become worshipers of men (messengers—Col. 2:18), not to swallow any man’s teachings without critical examination in the light of our lamp—the Word of God. We may remember with profit that man is not our teacher, but God ; and that any man used of him as an under-teacher will, to the extent that he is in God’s employ, teach, expound and harmonize his Word, and not merely theorize on isolated passages of Scripture aside from their context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When any new thought is suggested as to the meaning of a certain passage, turn to the passage and examine it critically, using the various translations of it at your command to see whether it seems to sustain the theory suggested. Nefkt, examine the preceding and succeeding verses to see if the idea suggested be in harmony with the entire argument of the inspired writer. If it is not in harmony rejedt it at once: do not trifle with evident misapplications. .If, however, it seems to be in harmony with the immediate context, measure it with all other Bible statements bearing on or relating to the subject. Whatever you receive after thus testing and proving will stay with you. You will know </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font11"> you believe and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font11"> you believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“PROVE. ALL THINGS—HOLD FAST THAT WHICH IS GOOD.’’ </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">—iThes.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5:21.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the student be a mechanic or a clerk or a house-keeper, with but limited time for study and using helps, he will soon come to the conclusion that the Apostle cannot have meant that each child of God should study up all the religious beliefs of the world, heathen and Christian; for life would be too short for a thorough study of each, if that were the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font11"> business. Nor can he have meant that we should study up all the ereeds of “Christendom,” with all the books which their various theologians have written in defense or explanation of their theories. Life would also be too short for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is a simple, quick way, however, by which those who have accepted Christ as their Redeemer and King can profe all doCtrines to be either true or false as fast as they are presented to them. We will lay it before you. It may save you years of doubt and uncertainty, and will surely save you much time from confusing study of theories which are only misleading, and it will quickly place your feet upon the sure foundation, and give you time to study in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you have received Christ and learned of him at all, you will not need to look at any system or theory which does not recognize him. You have already proved all other ways of salvation false. Now about theories which do acknowledge Christ. Though they be legion they all may be divided into two classes—those which teach a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">progressive development,</span><span class="font11"> or the gradual evolution of the human family from a lower to a higher state, and those which, on the contrary, claim that God created man perfect, in his own likeness, and that he fell from his perfection, mentally, morally and physically, by disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first of these acknowledges Christ as a teacher or guide only. Its advocates claim that he saves or develops men by his example, but that a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sacrifice</span><span class="font11"> for our sins was unnecessary, except as the condescension to be an example cost him </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The second of these views acknowledges Christ as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Redeemer,</span><span class="font11"> as well as Teacher. It accepts the Bible statement relative to man’s fall from divine favor—from perfection, from life, to disfavor and condemnation to death as a sinner. It acknowledges Christ’s sacrifice finished at Calvary as the payment of man’s penalty, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">price</span><span class="font11"> of his redemption, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">basis</span><span class="font11"> of all God’s favor to sinners in the forgiveness of sins past and weaknesses present, and the hope of a future return in God’s due time to a state of perfection and harmony with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The last named view is the Bible view, as you know; and it becomes an easy matter to judge, upon this line, any theory you may hear or read. Any theory which has no important place for the fall, and for the cross, its remedy, is not of God, for these are the fundamentals of God’s revealed plan.—i Cor. 15 13, 4, 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whatever you come across that will stand this test is on the right foundation, and is worthy of further examination and criticism with the Bible as the only standard. But any system which does not stand this test should be rejected promptly and forever. The more you seek to examine that which you see to be on a false, unscriptural basis, the more you will entangle and confuse yourself in the snare of the great adversary who seeks to beguile the bride of Christ as he did the bride of Adam. (Col. 2:4, 18; 2 Cor. 11:3.) Beware, therefore, of every theory as soon as you prove it to be off the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font11"> foundation, as soon as you find it contradicting God’s expressed penalty for sin, “ The soul that sinneth, it shall die,” and affirming Satan’s lie, “Yeshall not surely die parley no longer with it. “ Neither shall ye touch it,” which should have been Eve’s motto, should be yours, with reference to every doitrme proved false by the only standard—God’s Word.—See Gen. 3:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD IN CONCLUSION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is needful not only that you have the helps, and use them, as above suggested, but it will be needful that you begin to let shine upon others whatever light may reach you—not in pride, as though it were a discovery that you had made, but in humility, anxious only to lead others to the light for their profit and to honor your Father in heaven. (Matt. 5 :16.) The exercise of spreading the truth will read! favorably upon your own soul, and you will be brought more and more into fellowship with all the truth-hungry children of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, you will want the semi-monthly visits of Zion’s Watch Tower, with the information and. assistance it is continually giving to God’s saints. It is entirely unsecla-rian, thoroughly loyal to the Word of God, discards the wood, hay and stubble of human tradition, and builds with the precious promises of God upon the one sure Foundation, Christ and his sacrifice for sin. The price is moderate —designed merely to meet the actual expenses of publication. To any interested but unable to pay $1.00 per year, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Trail Society</span><span class="font11"> which publishes this trail will send the paper free upon request. We also </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">loan</span><span class="font11"> to the Lord’s poor, who will promise a careful reading and to return it, the book mentioned above as a special helping hand in Bible study—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Plan of the Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So, then, none are so poor as to be unable to get some helps to Bible study.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark20"></a>BAGSTER’S “COMPREHENSIVE TEACHERS’ BIBLE.”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">We cannot better tell you what this Bible is than by quoting from the editorial columns of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Advocate</span><span class="font1">, as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“What Edition of the Bible Shall I Buy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“As to letter-press and binding, Bagster’s Bibles have never been excelled by any house. But for the past few years the ‘Oxford Teachers’ Edition’ has taken the lead on account of the superior ‘ Helps to the Study of the 'Bible ’ which accompany that edition. During all these years the great London publishers have not been indifferent to the wants and demands of Bible students, and now they have brought out the most perfect Teachers’ Bible that has ever been published. The size of the print is the same as the corresponding 8vo ‘Oxford,’ but is clearer and more agreeable to the eye. The page is larger by a half inch in length and width, so that the book is better shaped and is not as clumsy in appearance. The text of the ‘Oxford ’ occupies i,ooo pages, while that of ‘ Bagster’s ’ fills but 773.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The superior excellence, however, of the ‘ Bagster ’ is seen in ‘ The Comprehensive Helps to Bible Study ’ which are found in the back part of the book. *These comprise sufficient matter of the most valuable character to fill </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font1"> good-sized I2mo volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ In the <sup>1</sup> Contents ’ of the ‘ Oxford Helps ’ there are 582 subjects noted; in the ‘ Bagster’ there are i860. This will give an idea of the fulness of information given. But the quality of this matter is of the very highest order. It has evidently been prepared by some masterworkman who knows what the ordinary Bible student wants to know and who possesses the happy faculty of expressing his thoughts in the most perspicuous manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ If a copy of this Bible could be placed iq the hands of all the Sunday-School teachers in the Church, and then if they could be induced to read thoughtfully these ‘ Helps,’ it would prove an untold blessing to millions, for every scholar would reap a measure of the benefit.”</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark31"></a>THE OXFORD TEACHERS’ BIBLE.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">This edition of the Scriptures is justly celebrated for its very comprehensive Index, Concordance and other helps to the study of the Bible, which constitute its appendix, within the same cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While in some respedis our preference is for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bagster Teachers' Bible</span><span class="font1"> is but just to say that they are both excellent, and that each has its friends who think it superior to the other. Armed with either as a sword of the spirit,” “the man of God may be thoroughly furnished” unto much good for the Lord, himself and his fellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Oxford”</span><span class="font1"> comes from the fadl that this work, with its helps, was originally published at Oxford, England. We do not handle the English edition, but the two American editions, which we describe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This edition is a facsimile of the English work, page for page—helps and all The paper is good, the binding corresponds with the same grades and descriptions of the Holman and the English editions, and while the type shows quite clear, it cannot be said to be equal in clearness to either of these editions.

<p><span class="font0">THE VARIORUM TEACHERS’ BIBLE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This valuable work has the usual references, a Concordance, Index and other helps somewhat similar to those of the “ Oxford ” and the “ Bagster,” which are preferred by some. But its distinctive feature is this: at the foot of each page of Scripture it gives the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">various renderings</span><span class="font1"> of obscure passages by learned men. (Sometimes these are valuable and sometimes confusing.) It gives also the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">various readings </span><span class="font1">of quite a number of old Greek and Hebrew Manuscripts where they differ from the received text of the Common Version. •</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This work is commented on by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Ensign</span><span class="font1"> as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ It is called the <sup>i</sup> Variorum’ Bible because, in addition to the common English version of the Scriptures, with copious references, it shows at the bottom of each page, 1. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">All corrections of the text which have been suggested by the great historic translations, critical scholars, and commentators, from the earliest times to the present day. 2. All improved readings or translations, from the best scholars of all ages.</span><span class="font1"> The results of these vast labors of the most competent and devoted Biblical students are expressed in English, briefly and clearly, by a simple system of references that anybody can use, so that we have under the eye at once the ripe fruit of all that has been done through the centuries to enable the English student of to-day to examine carefully, and understand intelligently, the Word of God. The scholars, critics, commentators, etc., are indicated by symbols or initials, which enable the student to compare their judgments, estimate their value, and search further in their works if he wishes to do so. . . . As an English Bible this work is simply matchless.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This edition of the Variorum Bible is the latest in every respect: it has not the Concordance, Index, etc., of the Teachers’ Edition, but it has a few additional notations in the foot-notes, bringing it up to date in every particular.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This very valuable work is more especially for those who have a thorough, grammatical English education.

<p><span class="font1">We describe the Bible in the words of another: “ Mr. Newberry annotated the Bible throughout, with immense care and patience, on a new system. By an arrangement of signs attached to the words of the text, he conveys to the English reader the precise nature of the article, moods, tenses and particles. Foot-notes supply succindt apparatus for textual criticism. Side-notes provide the originals of many of the most important words, as well as copious references. A work so complete, so ingenious and so helpful to the Bible student ought in this new form to enjoy extended popularity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The late Horatius Bonar said of it: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ It</span><span class="font1"> is beyond all price.

<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>MILLENNIAL DAWN.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">THIS IS THE GENERAL TITLE OF A SERIES OF BOOKS ’BY THE EDITOR OF ZION’S WATCH TOWER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. I., “ </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Plan of the Ages,</span><span class="font11"> ’ ’ gives an outline of the divine plan revealed in the Bible, relating to man’s redemption and restoration from sin and death : 350 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. II., </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“The Time is at Hand,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> treats of the manner and time of the Lord’s second coming, considering the Bible testimony on this subject: 366 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. III., “</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Thy Kingdom Come,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> considers prophecies which mark events connected with the “ Time of the End,” the glorification of the Church, and the establishment of the Millennial Kingdom ; it also contains a chapter on the Great Pyramid, showing its corroboration of the dates and other teachings of the Bible : 380 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The volumes of this series are of uniform size and price: In cloth binding, $1.00, postpaid (supplied to Watch Tower subscribers in any quantity for loaning, etc., at the wholesale rate, 50 cents each). In Leatherette covers, limp, 35 cents, and in paper covers 25 cents (35 cents when delivered by Colporteurs). In paper covers they are supplied to Watch Tower subscribers for loaning, etc., in packs of 5 or 10 or 20 of any one volume, at fifteen cents each, postage paid. And on request we will </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">loan</span><span class="font11"> to any too poor to purchase a paper-bound copy of any one volume, if he will promise a careful reading and to pay return postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[Vols. I. and II. are already published in the German language, and Vol. III. is now in preparation. Swedish and Danish translations of Vol. I. are in prospect.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">POEMS AND HYMNS OF t)AWN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This volume contains a very choice selection of 150 Poems and 333 Hymns, purged, we trust, from much of the too common, erroneous, hymn-book theology : 494 pages, good print, cloth binding </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">only.</span><span class="font11"> It is the Gospel of the Kingdom in verse, by the pens of many of God’s dear saints of all centuries. It is a companion to Millennial Dawn, and sells at same price. It is designed to lead the mind aright in meditation and worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A SIXTEEN PAGE MAGAZINE, ISSUED TWICE A MONTH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This journal is religious but not sectarian; and it is devoted to the investigation of all Bible subjects, in the interest of the truth only. With charity toward all, it is in bondage to no party, system or creed, but to Christ alone. It recognizes all consecrated believers in Christ’s atoning work, as members of the oi\e and only Church established by our Lord and the Apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If interested in the Millennial Dawn books, you cannot afford to do without the Watch Tower, and its price is small—one dollar a year in advance—free to any of the Lord’s children who through age or accident or other adversity are unable to pay, and who will send a Postal Card, yearly, stating their case and requesting the paper.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>THE HARVEST SICKLE.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">This is the name of a semi-monthly journal on the same line as the Watch Tower, but in the German language. Fifty cents a year in'advance—free to the Lord’s poor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THE EMPHATIC DIAGLOTT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This work, widely and favorably known, is a Greek New Testament with a literal, word for word, English translation, under the Greek text. It also gives an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">arranged</span><span class="font11"> English translation in a side column. Furthermore, it indicates the grammatical emphasis of the Greek text, so important yet so little appreciated, and not shown at all in the common version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The retail price of this work is $4.00, postage 16 cents. But a Brother, very anxious that all the Tower readers should possess this help, in order to bring it within the reach of all, arranged to supply the books at $1.50, if we would pay freight and postage, so that even the poor might have this blessing. We accepted the proposition, which still continues, but </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">is limited to WATCH TOWER SUBSCRIBERS—one copy each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">YOUNG’S ANALYTICAL CONCORDANCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">— GREEK, HEBREW AND ENGLISH.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This work is at once a, Greek and Hebrew Lexicon, giving the meaning of the original terms in English, and also a Concordance, giving all the words of Scripture, and the words which they translate. The value of the work is becoming more apparent daily, as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">theorists</span><span class="font11"> attempt to palm off a private interpretation under the guise of “a better definition of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">originall'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this superb volume every word is arranged under its own Hebrew and Greek original, exhibiting 311,000 references and 30,000 various readings. Its size is large quarto : 1094 pages. The retail price of the book is $5.00, with postage, 55 cents, added—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">$5.55.</span><span class="font11"> Our price is $4.25 by mail, postage prepaid by us ; or $3.70, if sent by express at purchaser’s charges. As it is quite a large volume (weight seven pounds), it will be cheapest, for most purchasers, to get it by mail. This is the “Author’s Edition,” and the latest, A. D. 1893, revision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">YOUNG’S CONCORDANCE IN GREAT BRITAIN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have made arrangements by which we can supply our readers in the United Kingdom with this work, post free, at 17 shillings in cloth binding, 20 shillings in half leather binding. The usual prices for the same are 24 and 28 shillings respectively, postage extra. A number of our friends in Great Britain have been desirous of securing this volume, but we have heretofore been unable to offer it at prices corresponding to that of the American edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our friends will please not ask for credit on this book, nor on any of those we offer for sale (—except the Millennial Dawn Series, to colporteurs on special terms). We are enabled to procure them at so low prices only by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">cash in advance</span><span class="font11"> payments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AN INDEX TO YOUNG’S CONCORDANCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This, too, is a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">very valuable</span><span class="font11"> work, but only to those who can appreciate it. Indeed, we fear that to some, who do not understand something about translating, it might be injurious. It shows all the various ways in which the Hebrew and Greek words have been translated in our Common Version Bible; and the unsophisticated might get the impression that a Greek or Hebrew word may be translated by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font11"> English word at the caprice of the translator ;—not knowing the difference in the arrangement of English sentences. But it is the entire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">phrase</span><span class="font11"> of the Greek or the Hebrew that must be compared with the English </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">phrase </span><span class="font11">which translates it and not always </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">word</span><span class="font11"> for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">word.</span><span class="font11"> Price, postpaid, 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CRUDEN’S BIBLE CONCORDANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In cloth binding—price 75 cents; postage 25 cents extra Much below the regular price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THE SYRIAC NEW TESTAMENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Murdoch’s Translation of the Syriac-Peshito manuscript is sometimes inquired for. We can supply it in substantial, half-leather binding, postpaid, for $2.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHERHAM’S TRANSLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the Nw Testament is valuable, as an emphasized translation, in critical study. We can supply it in cloth binding at the very low price of $1.00; postage 15 cents extra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">LEESER’S TRANSLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the Old Testament will also prove useful. It is a critical translation of the Old Testament by a Hebrew—the standard among Hebrews who read English. Price $1.35, including postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SMITH’S BIBLE DICTIONARY,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With useful information of an unsedtarian sort on all religious subjects, will be found of value; though we cannot endorse all of its theological definitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We can supply these at $1.00 per copy—postage 30 cents extra. This is below the usual price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SEVERAL OF THE FOREGOING BIBLE STUDY HELPS ARE MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED ON PAGES 9 AND IO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">TUNES FOR HYMNS OF DAWN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In preparing our collection of hymns we had the desire to make it complete by adding the music. But, since nearly all the modern tunes are copyrighted, we found that we must publish only the hymns with uncopyrighted tunes, or some with music and some without it, or do as we did do, —publish the best hymns from every quarter and indicate where the tunes can be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following hymn-books contain the. tunes; the first three named containing almost all of them. These books are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">standard</span><span class="font11"> and are sold very close by all dealers. Our prices, named below, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">include postage.</span><span class="font11"> We supply them merely for the convenience of those using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hymns of Dawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gospel Hymns (combined, Nos. i to 4),paper boards, $ .80 Songs of Pilgrimage (350 tunes),cloth, leatherback, 1.25 (The price of this elegant volume alone is limited by the publishers; but we are at liberty to supply it and our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hymns of Dawn</span><span class="font11"> together for $1.50, postpaid.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Winnowed Hymns, limp cloth, - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- $ .35</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THE EXHAUSTIVE CONCORDANCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As we go to press we are advised that this great work by James Strong, an M. E. minister of note, will probably be ready shortly. The prospectus indicates that this also will be a valuable Bible Study help. It must be ranked along side of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young's.</span><span class="font11"> It is on a different plan, and each will find those who will prefer it. Both would be desirable, but those who can have but the one will find difficulty in making a choice between these masterly works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young's</span><span class="font11"> Concordance is described foregoing. Its advantage over </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Strong's</span><span class="font11"> is in the fad that the texts are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">grouped </span><span class="font11">according to the originals and not according to the English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Strong's</span><span class="font11"> Concordance will be much like </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cruden 's</span><span class="font11"> in the arrangement as a concordance, but it will have the additional advantage that each reference, by a number, will indicate its Greek or Hebrew derivative and its signification in a lexicon which will follow the concordance in the same volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The publishers have announced prices as follows: Cloth binding, $5.00; Half Russia, $6.00; Half Turkey, $7.50; postage or expressage extra. They fear, however, that they can give little or no discount, and even announce that these prices may be advanced, as their expense is more than was anticipated.—However, we shall expedt </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font11"> discount, and will be &quot;able to save you at least the expressage or postage (about 60 cents), if nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FAMILY BIBLES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have arranged with the Methodist Publishing House for the choice line of Family Bibles in English and Ger^ man published by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These we will supply to any subscriber to Zion’s Watch Tower or to any purchaser of Millennial ‘Dawn at one half the regular list price, the price at which the publishers furnish them to agents, wholesale. Or we will supply them to any one else for 10 per cent more, to cover our time and trouble. Illustrated Catalogue free on application.</span></p>

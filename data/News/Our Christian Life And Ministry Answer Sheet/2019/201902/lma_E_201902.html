<p><span class="font5">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF FEBRUARY 4-25, 2019</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font4">] and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font4">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. How could “the ransom paid by Christ Jesus” cover “the sins that occurred in the past”? (Ro 3:24, 25) [Feb. 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w08</span><span class="font3"> 6/15 29 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font3">6] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The moment Jehovah stated the first Messianic prophecy, recorded at Genesis 3:15, the ransom price was as good as paid from his viewpoint, for nothing can prevent God from fulfilling what he purposes. So on the basis of the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, Jehovah could forgive the sins of descendants of Adam who exercised faith in that promise. The ransom also makes possible a resurrection of those of pre-Christian times.—Ac 24:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What is meant by baptism “into Christ Jesus” and baptism “into his death”? (Ro 6:3-5) [Feb. 11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w08 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6/15 29</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font3">7] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">When Jehovah anoints followers of Christ with the holy spirit, they are baptized into Christ Jesus. They become members of the congregation that is the body of Christ, he being the Head.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1Co 12:12, 13, 27; Col 1:18</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anointed Christians are also “baptized into</span><span class="font0"> [</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christ’s</span><span class="font0">] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">death” by living a life of sacrifice and renouncing any hope of everlasting life on earth. This baptism into Christ’s death is completed when they die and are resurrected to life in heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font3"> How does Jehovah respond to “unuttered groanings”? (Ro 8:26, 27) [Feb. 18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w09</span><span class="font3"> 11/15 7 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ff </span><span class="font3">20] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">At times, we may not know what to ask for in our private prayers. Jehovah caused many prayers to be recorded in the Scriptures. He accepts these inspired petitions as requests we would like to make, and then he can fulfill them according to his will. Jehovah answers our supplications when the spirit “pleads for us.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Why should we yield to the molding of the Great Potter, Jehovah? (Ro 9:21-23) [Feb. 25, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font3"> 6/15 25 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font3">5] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">When a person does not yield to Jehovah’s molding, the fault always lies with that person. Jehovah exercises his potterlike authority over humans by adjusting his dealings with them depending on their response to his molding. Those who respond properly are fashioned in a beneficial way.</span></p></li></ul>

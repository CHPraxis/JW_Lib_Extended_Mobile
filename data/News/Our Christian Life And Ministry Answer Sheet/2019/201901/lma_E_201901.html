<p><span class="font3">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF JANUARY 7-28, 2019</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. How could Paul’s sins be washed away? (Ac 22:16) [Jan. 7, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font1"> study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paul’s sins would be washed away, not by the baptismal water itself, but by his calling on the name of Jesus—put-ting faith in him and demonstrating that faith by Christian works.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Why did Paul call himself a Pharisee? (Ac 23:6) [Jan. 14, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font1"> study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paul was speaking to the Sanhedrin, made up of Pharisees, who believed in the resurrection, and Sadducees, who did not. By referring to himself as a Pharisee, Paul acknowledged his common heritage with the Pharisees and their shared belief in the resurrection. They understood that he was not misrepresenting himself, since they knew that he had become a zealous Christian. Paul apparently hoped that raising this controversial issue would cause some members of the Sanhedrin to sympathize with his argument, and the strategy worked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. What is a “goad”? (Ac 26:14) [Jan. 21, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font1"> study note; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font1"> glossary, “Goad”] </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A goad is a long rod with a sharp metal point, used by farmers to prod an animal. The goad is compared to a wise person’s words that move the listener to heed wise counsel. “Kicking against the goads” is a proverb based on the image of a stubborn bull that resists the prodding of the goad by kicking against it, resulting in injury to itself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. What is significant about the detail regarding the ship’s figurehead? (Ac 28:11) [Jan. 28, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font1">study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">According to Greek and Roman mythology, the “Sons of Zeus” were regarded, among other things, as the protectors of mariners, able to save sailors imperiled at sea. This detail is another testimony that the account was written by an eyewitness.</span></p></li></ul>

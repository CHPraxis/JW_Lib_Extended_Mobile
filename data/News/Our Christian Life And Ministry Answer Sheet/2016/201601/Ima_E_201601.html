<p><span class="font7">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF JANUARY 4-25, 2016</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font6"> [</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font6">] and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> [</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font6">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting the chairman should pay careful attention in order to verifythatthe question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point or highlight reasons for the answer or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. Of course, any answers given by the audience that are appropriate and in harmony with our present understanding are acceptable, even if the point is not found on the answer sheet. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. What is the most practical step we can take to prepare for future difficulties? (2Ch 32:7, 8) [Jan. 4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font4"> 11/15 20 fl 17] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">We should strengthen our faith in God and help our brothers to do the same. We must all be ready to obey any instructions that we may receive, whether these appear sound from a strategic or human standpoint or not. Now is the time for any who may be putting their trust in secular education, material things, or human institutions to adjust their thinking.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. What encouragement can we draw from Josiah’s example? (2Ch 34:1-3) [Jan. 11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font4"> 12/1 21 fl6] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Any negative circumstances of childhood need not prevent us from coming to know God and serving him. Josiah’s repentant grandfather, Manasseh, may have exerted a positive influence on him, or perhaps faithful Levites instructed him in true worship. Such early positive influences eventually produced fine results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Why were the Israelites who did not volunteer to return to Jerusalem not necessarily weak in faith? (Ezr 1:3-6) [Jan. 18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w06</span><span class="font4"> 1/15 17 fl5; 19 fl1] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Some Israelites may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship, but this was not true in every case. The 1,000-mile</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1,600 km</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning. Like some of the Israelites who remained in Babylon, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses cannot take up the full-time ministry or serve where the need is greater. Yet, they support and encourage those who can and make voluntary donations to further the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. How serious a threat was intermarriage with “the peoples of the lands”? (Ezr 9:1, 2) [Jan. 25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w06 </span><span class="font4">1/15 20 fl1] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The restored nation was to be the guardian of Jehovah’s worship until the coming of the Messiah. Intermarriage with other inhabitants was a real threat to true worship. Because some had formed marriage alliances with the idol-worshipping people, the entire nation might eventually be assimilated into the pagan nations. To whom, then, would the Messiah come? No wonder Ezra was stunned at seeing what had taken place!</span></p></li></ul>

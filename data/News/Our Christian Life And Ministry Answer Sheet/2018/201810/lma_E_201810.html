<p><span class="font5">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF OCTOBER 1-29, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. In what sense did the formerly blind beggar do obeisance to Jesus? (Joh 9:38) [Oct. 1, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font3">study note] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The healed man viewed Jesus, not as God or a deity, but as the foretold “Son of man,” the Messiah with divine authority.</span><span class="font2"> (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Joh 9:35</span><span class="font2">) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">When he bowed down to Jesus, he apparently did so in a way similar to that of people mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. They bowed down when meeting prophets, kings, or other representatives of God.—1Sa 25:23, 24; 2Sa 14: 4-7; 1Ki 1:16; 2Ki 4:36, 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. Why were some Jews afraid to acknowledge Jesus as the Christ? (Joh 12:42) [Oct. 8, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3"> study notes] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Some Jews, perhaps even members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high court, feared being expelled, or banned, from the synagogue. An expelled person would be shunned and scorned as a social outcast. Such cutting off of fellowship from other Jews would have severe economic consequences for the family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. How would those who exercise faith in Jesus “do works greater” than he did? (Joh 14:12) [Oct. 15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3"> study note] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus was not saying that the miraculous works his disciples would perform would be greater than his own miraculous works. Rather, he humbly acknowledged that his followers would cover more territory, reach more people, and preach for a longer period of time than he did.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What is “the founding of the world”? (Joh 17:24) [Oct. 22, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3"> study note] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Greek word for “founding” is rendered “to conceive” at Hebrews 11:11, where it is used with “offspring.” Here used in the expression “founding of the world,” it apparently refers to the birth of children to Adam and Eve. At Luke 11:50, 51, Jesus associates “the founding of the world” with Abel, apparently the first redeemable human and the first to have his name “written in the scroll of life from the founding of the world.”—Re 17:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. What does it mean that Jesus “gave up his spirit”? (Joh 19:30) [Oct. 29, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3"> study note] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This expression may also be rendered “he expired; he stopped breathing.” “Gave up” may mean that Jesus voluntarily stopped struggling to stay alive, since all things had been accomplished. He willingly “poured out his life even to death.”—Isa 53:12; Joh 10:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF MAY 7-28, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> (study edition) [</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font5">], </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> [</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font5">], and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus—The Way, the Truth, the Life</span><span class="font5"> [</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">jy</span><span class="font5">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. How is Jesus’ consideration for this deaf man an example for us? (Mr 7:32-35) [May 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w00</span><span class="font4"> 2/15 17-18 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font4">9-11] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus was sensitive to people’s feelings. As a result, he was moved to act in ways that spared their feelings. We can show consideration for the feelings of others by according them dignity, treating them as we would like to be treated. That would include being careful about what we say as well as how we say it. We should avoid harsh words, unrelenting criticism, and biting sarcasm—all of which can cause hurt feelings that are not easily healed. When we thus demonstrate consideration for others, we show that we have the mind of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Why did Jesus correct a certain man for calling him “Good Teacher”? (Mr 10:17, 18) [May 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font4">study notes] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The man was evidently using the words “Good Teacher” as a flattering and formalistic title. While Jesus had no objection to being properly identified as “Teacher” and “Lord” </span><span class="font1">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Joh 13:13</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">, he directed all honor to his Father. Jehovah is the ultimate standard of what is good, the one who has the sovereign right to determine what is good and what is bad.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Why did Jesus call the temple “a house of prayer for all the nations”? (Mr 11:17) [May 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font4">study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Although the temple was being used for commerce, making it a cave of robbers, it was meant to be a place where both Israelites and God-fearing foreigners could worship and pray to Jehovah.—1Ki 8:41-43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. What may have been the reason why Jesus chose to answer the high priest’s question? (Mr 14:60</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">62)</span><span class="font4"> [May 28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">287</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font4">4] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">If he did not do so, that could have been construed as denying that he is God’s Son and the Christ.</span></p></li></ul>

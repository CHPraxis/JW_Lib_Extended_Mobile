<p><span class="font3">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF NOVEMBER 5-26, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2">], </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Bearing Thorough Witness” About God’s Kingdom</span><span class="font2"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bt</span><span class="font2">], </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font2"> Volumes 1 [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font2">-1] and 2 [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font2">-2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Why did Thomas call Jesus “my Lord and my God”? (Joh 20:28) [Nov. 5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">There is no reason to believe that Thomas thought that Jesus was the almighty God. It may be that Thomas used this expression because he viewed Jesus as being “a god.” Or he may have addressed Jesus in a manner similar to the way that servants of God addressed angelic messengers of Jehovah, as recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, acknowledging Jesus as God’s representative and spokesman.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Why is Jesus called “the Chief Agent of life”? (Ac 3:15) [Nov. 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-2 61</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font4">l] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus’ sacrifice made possible the union of Christ’s chosen followers with him in his heavenly reign as well as the arrangement to have earthly subjects of his Kingdom rule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. In what way is Jesus “the chief cornerstone”? (Ac 4:11) [Nov. 19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font4">-1 514 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font4">4] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Just as the topmost stone of a building is conspicuous, so Jesus Christ is the crowning stone of the Christian congregation of anointed ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. In what way are Christians today privileged to share in work like that done by Philip? (Ac 8:26-30) [Nov. 26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bt</span><span class="font4"> 58 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ff </span><span class="font4">16] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Often, Christians are able to present the Kingdom message to those they meet in informal settings, such as when traveling. In many cases, it is apparent that their meeting up with an honesthearted individual is by angelic direction.</span></p></li></ul>

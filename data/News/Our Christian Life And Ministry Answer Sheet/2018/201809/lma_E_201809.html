<p><span class="font6">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF SEPTEMBER 3-24, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font5">] and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> [</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font5">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. What reasons are there for saying that John did not mean that “the Word” was the same as Almighty God? (Joh 1:1) [Sept. 3, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study notes] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John wrote that “the Word” was “with God,” indicating two different persons. The grammatical construction of John’s words in Greek conveys the idea that “the Word” was “a god; divine; a divine being; of divine kind; godlike.” This harmonizes with other Bible verses, such as Isaiah 9:6, 7; Colossians 2:9; and 2 Peter 1:4. A number of Bible translations in various languages render the text in a way similar to the “New World Translation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. How might the Samaritan woman have understood Jesus’ expression “living water,” but what was Jesus referring to? (Joh 4:10) [Sept. 10, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">It appears that she initially understood Jesus’ words literally, that he was referring to flowing water from a spring. However, Jesus was using the term figuratively to refer to life-giving water that would quench her spiritual thirst.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. How does the Father draw people to himself? (Joh 6:44) [Sept. 17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Through the Bible’s message and through his holy spirit, God gently draws to himself those who have a heart that is rightly disposed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Did Jesus lie to his unbelieving fleshly brothers? (Joh 7:8-10) [Sept. 24, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2/1 6</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font2">4] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">No. Jesus “committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.”</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1Pe 2:22</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">His brothers were not entitled to know the exact details of his whereabouts. He gave them an incomplete answer in order to limit the possible harm they could do to him or to his followers.</span></p></li></ul>

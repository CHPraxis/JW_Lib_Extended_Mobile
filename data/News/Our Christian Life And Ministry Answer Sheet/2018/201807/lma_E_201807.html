<p><span class="font4">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF JULY 2-30, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. In what way did Jesus set a good example for Christians facing major decisions? (Lu 6:12, 13) [July 2, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">8/1 6</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font0">l] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Before making major decisions in life, spiritually-minded Christians take ample time to pray to God and seek the direction of the holy spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Why did Jesus not prevent a man from expelling demons, even though the man was not following him? (Lu 9:49, 50) [July 9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w08 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font0"> 31 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font0">2] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus did not prevent the man because the Christian congregation had not yet been formed. Hence, it was not required that the man physically accompany Jesus in order to exercise faith in Jesus’ name and expel demons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. What does the illustration about the persistent man teach us about praying? (Lu 11: 5-9) [July 16, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0"> study notes] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus says that the man received what he needed “because of his bold persistence.” Since Jesus presents him as an example for us, our prayers should likewise be persistent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">4. Why did Jesus make this statement? (Lu 13:33) [July 23, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0"> study note] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">While no Bible prophecy explicitly states that the Messiah would die in Jerusalem, this idea may be inferred from Daniel 9:24 -26. Additionally, it would be expected that if the Jews were to kill a prophet, and especially the Messiah, it would be in that city. Jesus may also have had in mind that Jerusalem was where the regular sacrifices were offered to God and where the Passover lamb was slaughtered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">5. What was Jesus’ point regarding “unrighteous riches”? (Lu 16:10-13) [July 30, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w17.07</span><span class="font0"> 8-9 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font0">7-8] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus’ point was that we can control the use of those riches once we obtain them. An obvious way to prove ourselves faithful with our material things is by contributing financially to the worldwide preaching work that Jesus foretold would take place.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF APRIL 2-30, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> (study edition) [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. What may have moved Jesus to pray: “Let this cup pass away from me”? (Mt 26:39) [Apr. 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font2">study note] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the Bible, “cup” is often used figuratively of God’s will, or the “assigned portion,” for a person. Jesus no doubt felt great concern over the reproach that his death as one charged with blasphemy and sedition could bring on God, moving him to pray that this “cup” pass away from him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. How did Jehovah’s angel dignify the women who came to Jesus’ grave? (Mt 28:7) [Apr. 9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty </span><span class="font2">study note] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">These women are not only the first disciples to be told of Jesus’ resurrection but also the ones instructed to inform the other disciples.</span><span class="font3"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mt 28:2, 5, 7</span><span class="font3">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">According to unscriptur-al Jewish tradition, a woman’s testimony was not permissible in a court of law. By contrast, Jehovah’s angel dignifies the women by giving them this joyful assignment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. Why did Jesus call himself “Lord . . . of the Sabbath”? (Mr 2:27, 28) [Apr. 16, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus applies this expression to himself, indicating that the Sabbath was at his disposal for doing the work commanded by his heavenly Father.</span><span class="font3"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Compare John 5:19; 10:37, 38.</span><span class="font3">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">On the Sabbath, Jesus performed some of his most outstanding miracles, which included healing the sick.</span><span class="font3"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lu 13:10-13; Joh 5:5-9; 9:1 -14</span><span class="font3">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This evidently foreshadowed the kind of relief he will bring during his Kingdom rule, which will be like a sabbath rest.—Heb 10:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. What does it mean to blaspheme against the holy spirit, and what are the consequences? (Mr 3: 29) [Apr. 23, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study notes] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blasphemy refers to defamatory, injurious, or abusive speech against God or against sacred things. Since holy spirit emanates from God himself, willfully opposing or denying its operation amounted to blasphemy against God. The Jewish religious leaders saw God’s spirit at work in Jesus as he performed miracles; yet, they attributed this power to Satan the Devil. Such willful sin has eternal consequences; there is no sacrifice to cover such sin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. What does it mean to “shake off the dirt that is on your feet”? (Mr 6:11) [Apr. 30, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This gesture signified that the disciples disclaimed responsibility for the consequences that would come from God. Paul and Barnabas applied this instruction in Pisidian Antioch.</span><span class="font3"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ac 13:51</span><span class="font3">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Paul did something similar in Corinth by shaking out his garments, adding: “Let your blood be on your own heads. I am clean.”—Ac 18:6.</span></p></li></ul>

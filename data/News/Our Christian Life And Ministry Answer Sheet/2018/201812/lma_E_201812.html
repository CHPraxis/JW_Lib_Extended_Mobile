<p><span class="font7">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF DECEMBER 3-31, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font6"> (Study Edition) [</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font6">], </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> [</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font6">], and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Bearing Thorough Witness” About God’s Kingdom</span><span class="font6"> [</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bt</span><span class="font6">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Why is it significant that the apostle Peter lodged with a tanner? (Ac 10:6) [Dec. 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A tanner worked with the hides of animals, using a lime solution to remove any fur or traces of flesh and fat. Then he treated the hide with a potent liquor so that it could be used to make articles of leather. According to the Mosaic Law, a person who worked with the carcasses of animals was ceremonially impure.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le 5:2; 11:39</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore, many Jews looked down on tanners and would hesitate to lodge with one. In fact, the Talmud later rated the tanner’s profession as lower than that of a dung collector. However, Peter did not let prejudice keep him from staying with Simon. Peter’s open-mindedness makes an interesting prelude to the assignment that came next—visiting a Gentile in his home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. What do we learn from what happened to Herod? (Ac 12:21-23) [Dec. 10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w08</span><span class="font2"> 5/15 32 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font2">7] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herod readily accepted glory that should be given only to God. We should not desire glory for whatever accomplishments we may have in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. What can we learn from Acts 16:6-9 about expanding our ministry? [Dec. 17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font2"> 1/15 10 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font2">8] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Only after Paul set out for Asia did God’s spirit intervene. Then, only after Paul neared Bithynia did Jesus step in. And finally, only after Paul reached Troas did Jesus direct him to Macedonia. Jesus may deal with us in a similar way. For example, you may have been thinking about serving as a pioneer or moving to an area where the need is greater. But it may be only after you take steps to reach your goal that Jesus, by means of God’s spirit, will guide you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. How should we imitate Paul as we pursue spiritual goals? (Ac 18:21) [Dec. 24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2"> study note] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The apostle Paul emphasized the need to take God’s will into account when doing or planning to do anything.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1Co 4:19; 16:7; Heb 6:3</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anyone who sincerely says “if Jehovah is willing” must try to act in harmony with Jehovah’s will. The expression does not always need to be made audibly but is often made only in the heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. How did the apostle Paul set an example in being industrious and adaptable? (Ac 19:9) [Dec. 31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bt</span><span class="font2"> 161 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font2">11] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul spoke in that school auditorium daily for two years. He may have spoken from about 11:00 a.m. until about 4:00 p.m. Those were likely the quietest but hottest hours of the day when many stopped their work to eat and rest. Paul adjusted his schedule so that his ministry met the needs of the people in that community.</span></p></li></ul>

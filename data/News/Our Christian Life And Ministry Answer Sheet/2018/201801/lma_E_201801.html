<p><span class="font3">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF JANUARY 1-29, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (study edition) [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font2">], </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2">], and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus—The Way, the Truth, the Life</span><span class="font2"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jy</span><span class="font2">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Why might five women have been included in Matthew’s otherwise all-male genealogy of Jesus? (Mt 1:3) [Jan. 1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">These women are likely included because there is something outstanding in the way each one came to be an ancestress of Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Satan tried to tempt Jesus to do what? (Mt 4:9) [Jan. 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Greek verb that can be rendered “to worship” is here in the aorist tense, which indicates a momentary action. Rendering it “do an act of worship” shows that the Devil did not ask Jesus to do constant or continuous worship to him; it was a single “act of worship.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. How can we apply this verse when preparing introductions for the ministry? (Mt 7:12) [Jan. 15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w14 </span><span class="font4">5/15 14-15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font4">14-16] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We should put ourselves in the place of the householder and consider how we would like to be approached. Instead of starting off with a question that may cause the householder to wonder who we are and why we are asking such a question, we would be more effective if we began by letting the householder know the purpose of our visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font4"> What point was Jesus making with these two illustrations? (Mt 9:16,17) [Jan. 22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">70</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font4">6] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No one should have expected Jesus’ followers to conform to the old practices of Judaism. Jesus did not come to patch up and prolong an old, worn-out way of worship, a whole system of worship that was ready to be discarded. The worship that Jesus was encouraging was not one that conformed to the Judaism of the day with its traditions of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Why did John the Baptist ask this question? (Mt 11:2, 3) [Jan. 29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy</span><span class="font4"> 96 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font4">2-3] </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">John may have simply wanted verification directly from Jesus that he was the Messiah. John was acquainted with the Bible prophecies that show that the Anointed One of God was to be a king and a deliverer. Yet, many months after Jesus was baptized, John was in prison. So John was asking if there was to be another one coming, a successor to Jesus, as it were, who would complete the fulfillment of all that the Messiah was foretold to accomplish.</span></p></li></ul>

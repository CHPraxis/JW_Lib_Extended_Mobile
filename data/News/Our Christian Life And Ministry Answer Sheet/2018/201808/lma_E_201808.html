<p><span class="font5">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">1. What kind of faith is Jesus referring to at Luke 18:8? [Aug. 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The use of the Greek definite article before the word “faith” indicates that Jesus was referring, not to faith in general, but to a particular kind of faith, like that of the widow in Jesus’ illustration.</span><span class="font1"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lu 18:1 -8</span><span class="font1">) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This would include having faith in the power of prayer as well as faith that God will cause justice to be done to his chosen ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. How does Jesus’ statement strengthen our confidence in the resurrection? (Lu 20:38) [Aug. 13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s purpose to resurrect his approved servants is so sure of fulfillment that from his standpoint they are still living.—Ro 4:16, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. What covenant did Jesus make, with whom did he make it, and what does it accomplish? (Lu 22:28-30) [Aug. 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w14</span><span class="font4"> 10/15 16-17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font4">15-16] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus made a personal covenant with his 144,000 anointed followers to rule as kings and serve as priests with him in heaven.</span><span class="font1"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Re 3:21</span><span class="font1">) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This covenant, often called the Kingdom covenant, forms a legal basis for them to rule with Jesus in heaven.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">4. What is Jesus apparently referring to at Luke 23:31? [Aug. 27, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4"> study note] </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus is apparently referring to the Jewish nation. It was like a dying tree that still had some moisture left, for Jesus was present and so were a number of Jews who believed in him. However, Jesus would soon be executed, and faithful Jews would be anointed with holy spirit and become part of spiritual Israel.</span><span class="font1"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ro 2:28, 29; Ga 6:16</span><span class="font1">) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">At that time, the literal nation of Israel would be spiritually dead, resembling a withered tree.</span></p></li></ul>

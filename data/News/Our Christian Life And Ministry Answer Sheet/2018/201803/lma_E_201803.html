<p><span class="font4">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF MARCH 5-26, 2018</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> (study edition) [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. When the crowds shouted: “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” what did they mean? (Mt 21:9) [Mar. 5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font5"> study note] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Save, we pray” is a plea to God for salvation or victory. It could be rendered “please, grant salvation to.” By using the expression “Son of David,” the crowd showed recognition of Jesus’ line of descent and his role as the promised Messiah. One way God answered this prayer was by resurrecting Jesus from the dead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. What are “Caesar’s things,” and what are “God’s things”? (Mt 22:21) [Mar. 12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font5"> study note] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Caesar’s things” include payment for services rendered by the secular government as well as the honor and relative subjection that is to be shown to such authorities. “God’s things” include a person’s life, wholehearted worship, whole-souled love, and complete, loyal obedience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. What may Jesus’ wording suggest? (Mt 24:8) [Mar. 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font5"> study note] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It may suggest that like birth pains, the foretold troubles and suffering will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration in the time period before the great tribulation mentioned at Matthew 24:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. How can we express our friendship toward Christ’s brothers? (Mt 25:40) [Mar. 26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w09</span><span class="font5"> 10/15 16 ^| 16-18] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">First, by wholeheartedly sharing in the preaching work. Second, by financially supporting the preaching work. And third, by cooperating with the direction provided by congregation elders.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. What is the meaning of Luke 2:14? [June 18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font3"> study notes] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The expression “men of goodwill” refers to people who have God’s approval and goodwill, and it could also be rendered “people whom he approves; people with whom he is well-pleased.” So this angelic statement referred to God’s goodwill, not toward men in general, but toward those who would please him by their genuine faith in him and by becoming followers of his Son.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What shows that Jesus was thoroughly familiar with God’s Word?

<p><span class="font5">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF AUGUST 7-28, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font4">], </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font4">], and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> Volume 2 [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font4">-2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. How did the course taken by Tyre’s rulers resemble that of Satan? (Eze 28:12-19) [Aug. 7, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font3">-2 604 fl4-5] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The direct application of this dirge may be to the line of Tyrian rulers rather than to any one specific king. However, certain references to “the king of Tyre,” his pride, his making himself a god, his being called a “cherub,” and the reference to “Eden, the garden of God,” certainly apply to Satan the Devil, who became puffed up with pride, is linked to the serpent in Eden, and is called “the god of this system of things.”—2Co 4:4; Ge 3:1-5, 14, 15; 1Ti 3:6; Re 12:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. How has this verse been fulfilled? (Eze 34:23) [Aug. 14, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 4/1 26 fl3] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">During the time of the end, Jesus Christ, the Greater David, is the “one shepherd” whom Jehovah appointed over all His servants on earth, both the spirit-anointed Christians and the “other sheep.”</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joh 10:16</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Just like his Father, Jesus shepherds the sheep with tenderness.—Isa 40:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. What is a primary reason why we must maintain fine conduct? (Eze 36:20, 21) [Aug. 21, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w02</span><span class="font3"> 6/15 20 fl12] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our conduct reflects on Jehovah. The Israelites profaned God’s name among the nations because they did not live up to what they were known as, that is, “the people of Jehovah.” If we ignore Christian morality, we dishonor its Source. Conversely, if we hold firmly to God’s standards, we reflect well on him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. When humans blame God for injustice, how are they profaning his name? (Eze 39:7) [Aug. 28, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font3"> 9/1 21 fl2] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s name embraces his reputation. What is known of Jehovah when it comes to injustice? He hates it! He also has compassion for its victims.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ex 22:22-24</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">When humans claim that God is responsible for the very things he abhors, they are sullying his reputation. They thus “treat</span><span class="font0"> [</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font0">] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">name with disrespect.”—Ps 74:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF JULY 3—31, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. What lessons do we learn from the mention of these individuals? (Eze 14:13, 14) [July 3, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w16.05 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">26</span><span class="font3"> fl 13; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span><span class="font3"> 13 fl9] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah notices and values the integrity of all of his faithful worshippers, including those who are relatively young. Gaining salvation is our personal responsibility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What is the “permanent covenant,” and who are included in it? (Eze 16:60) [July 10, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w88</span><span class="font3"> 9/15 17 fl7] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God would establish the new covenant with spiritual Israel, and its results will endure forever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Why did the Israelites develop a wrong viewpoint about Jehovah, and how can we avoid making the same mistake? (Eze 18:29) [July 17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font3"> 8/15 11 par. 9] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">They did not have all the facts. It was as if the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day had set themselves up as judges of God, putting their own standards of justice above Jehovah’s and judging him based on their own limited understanding of events. A key to avoiding the trap of judging Jehovah by our own standards is to recognize that our viewpoint is limited and at times seriously flawed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What error is highlighted in chapter 23, and what lesson can we learn? (Eze 23:49) [July 24, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 7/1 14 fl6] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Making political alliances led Israel and Judah to adopt the false worship of their allies. Let us guard against forming worldly ties that can destroy our faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. What does the rust of the cooking pot represent? (Eze 24:6, 12) [July 31, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 7/1 14 fl2] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jerusalem under siege is likened to a widemouthed cooking pot. Its rust represents the moral filth of the city—the uncleanness, brazen conduct, and bloodshed for which she is responsible. So great is her uncleanness that even standing the pot empty upon its coals and making it very hot fails to remove the rust.</span></p></li></ul>

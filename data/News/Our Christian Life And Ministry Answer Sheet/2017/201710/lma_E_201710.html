<p><span class="font6">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF OCTOBER 2-30, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> [</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font5">] and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> [</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font5">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. What covenant was kept in force for the many until the end of the 70th week of years, or 36 C.E.? (Da 9:27) [Oct. 2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">9/1 20</span><span class="font3"> fl4] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Law covenant was removed in 33 C.E. when Jesus was killed. But by keeping the Abrahamic covenant in force toward fleshly Israel and proselytes until 36 C.E., Jehovah extended the period of special favor to the Jews on the basis of their being descendants of Abraham. The Abrahamic covenant continues in force with regard to “the Israel of God.”—Ga 3:7-9, 14 -18, 29; 6:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. Who are “those having insight,” and when do they “shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven”? (Da 12:3) [Oct. 9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font3"> 7/15 13 fl16, endnote] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“Those having insight” are anointed Ch ristians. While still on earth, they “shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven” by sharing in the preaching work. However, Matthew 13:43 points to the future time when they will shine brightly in the heavenly Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. When was the house of Judah shown mercy and saved? (Ho 1:7) [Oct. 16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 9/15 14 fl7] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">This was fulfilled in 732 B.C.E., in the days of King Hezekiah. At that time, Jehovah ended the Assyrian threat to Jerusalem by having an angel slay 185,000 of the enemy’s forces in one night.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2Ki 19:34, 35</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah thus delivered Judah, not “by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen,” but by an angel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. How were these words fulfilled in Jesus? (Ho 11:1) [Oct. 23, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w11</span><span class="font3"> 8/15 10 fl10] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Like the Israelites, the Messiah would be called out of Egypt. Before Herod’s death-dealing decree, an angel directed that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus go to Egypt. There they remained “until the death of Herod.”—Mt 2:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. What is “the valley of the decision”? (Joe 3:14) [Oct. 30, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 13 fl3] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">It is a symbolic place for measuring out God’s judgment. In the days of Judean King Jehoshaphat, whose name means “Jehovah Is Judge,” God delivered Judah from surrounding nations by confusing their military forces. Therefore, the place is also called “the Valley of Jehoshaphat.”</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Joe 3:2, 12</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In our day, it represents a symbolic location in which nations will be crushed like grapes in a winepress.—Re 19:15.</span></p></li></ul>

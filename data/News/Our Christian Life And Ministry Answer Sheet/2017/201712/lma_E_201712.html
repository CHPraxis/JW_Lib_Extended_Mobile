<p><span class="font4">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF DECEMBER 4-31, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. In what ways was the glory of Zerubbabel’s temple greater than that of Solomon’s temple? (Hag 2:9) [Dec. 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span><span class="font3"> 9 fl3] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">This was in at least three ways: the number of years Zerubba-bel’s temple was in existence, who taught there, and who flocked there to worship Jehovah. Although Solomon’s glorious temple stood for 420 years, from 1027 B.C.E. to 607 B.C.E., Zerubbabel’s temple, “this house,” was in use for over 580 years, from its completion in 515 B.C.E. to its destruction in 70 C.E. Moreover, the Messiah—Jesus Christ—taught in “this house,” and more people came to it than to “the former” in order to worship God.—Ac 2:1-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What do the two copper mountains represent? (Zec 6:1) [Dec. 11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w17.10</span><span class="font3"> 27-28 fl7-8] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In the Bible, mountains can represent kingdoms, or governments. The mountains in Zechariah’s account are similar to two mountains described in Daniel’s prophecy.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Da 2:35, 45</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">One mountain represents Jehovah’s universal and eternal rulership. The other mountain represents the Messianic Kingdom in the hands of Jesus. Since copper is a metal that is highly valued, the copper of the two symbolic mountains reminds us of the excellent quality of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and of the Messianic Kingdom, which will provide stability and blessings to all mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. How will Jehovah “save the tents of Judah first”? (Zec 12:7) [Dec. 18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 12/15 25 fl13] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In ancient Israel, if an enemy nation came to attack the city of Jerusalem, shepherds and agricultural workers living in tents would be the first in need of protection. The expression “the tents of Judah” indicates that the anointed remnant are out in the open field, so to speak, not in fortified cities. There they fearlessly defend the interests of the Messianic Kingdom. Jehovah will save them first because these are in the direct line of Satan’s attack.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. How was Malachi 3:1 fulfilled in the first century and in modern times? [Dec. 25, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font3"> 7/15 10-11 fl5-6] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In the first century, John the Baptizer was the ‘messenger who cleared up the way.’</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mt 11:10, 11</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">When he came in 29 C.E., a time of judgment for the nation of Israel had drawn close. Jesus was the second messenger. He cleansed the temple in Jerusalem twice—first at the start of his ministry and second toward the end.</span><span class="font0"> (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mt 21:12, 13; Joh 2: 14 -17</span><span class="font0">) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">So Jesus’ cleansing work involved a period of time. During the decades leading up to 1914, C. T. Russell and his close associates did a work like that of John the Baptizer. That vital work involved restoring Bible truths. Then, in 1914, Jesus began to inspect the spiritual temple. That inspection and cleansing work involved a period of time—from 1914 to the early part of 1919.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF NOVEMBER 6-27, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font4">] and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font4">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. What did “a basket of summer fruit” signify? (Am 8:1, 2) [Nov. 6, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span><span class="font1"> 14 </span><span class="font0">fl</span><span class="font1">6] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Summer fruit is picked toward the end of the harvest season, that is, toward the end of the agricultural year. When Jehovah caused Amos to see “a basket of summer fruit,” it meant that the end was near for Israel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. How did Edom “perish forever”? (Ob 10) [Nov. 13, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font1"> 11/1 13 </span><span class="font0">fl</span><span class="font1">5] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Babylonian King Nabo-nidus conquered Edom about the middle of the sixth century B.C.E. By the fourth century B.C.E., Edom’s territory was inhabited by the Nabataeans, and the Edomites had to take up residence in the southern part of Judah, the area of the Negeb that later came to be known as Idumea. After the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the Edomites ceased to exist as a distinctly separate people. Thus, as foretold, the nation of Edom, with a government and people in a specific region of the earth, became extinct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Why should we “show a waiting attitude” for Jehovah? (Mic 7:7) [Nov. 20, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w03</span><span class="font1"> 8/15 24 </span><span class="font0">fl</span><span class="font1">20] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Every week thousands of people are just beginning to walk with God. Having a waiting attitude, or patience, helps us to avoid feeling disappointed that Jehovah’s day has not yet come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Although we may face hardship before and during Armageddon, what confidence can we have? (Hab 3:17-19) [Nov. 27, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font1"> 11/15 10 </span><span class="font0">fl</span><span class="font1">10] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We can be confident that Jehovah will supply us with strength as we joyfully continue serving him.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting Answer Sheet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR USE BY MEETING CHAIRMAN FOR WEEKS OF SEPTEMBER4-25, 2017</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font4">], </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font4">], and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> Volume 2 [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font4">-2].</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTRUCTIONS: These review questions correspond to material found in Treasures From God’s Word. Well in advance, the meeting chairman should ensure that the elder or ministerial servant assigned a part during Treasures From God’s Word will consider the question and answer for the week. During the meeting, the chairman should make sure that the question is answered correctly by the audience. If necessary, he may clarify the main point, highlight reasons for the answer, or briefly comment on how the material can be applied. During the three-minute conclusion of the meeting, the chairman should briefly review the question and answer from the current week, and he may mention the question for the following week as part of the preview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The date in brackets represents the week that the material will be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. How did Israel defile God’s name? (Eze 43:8, 9) [Sept. 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-2 467</span><span class="font2"> fl</span><span class="font0">4] </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Israel failed to live up to God’s righteous standards. The Israelites’ unfaithfulness, which resulted in divine punishment, gave other nations the opportunity to malign God’s name. Failing to recognize that the chastisement came from Jehovah, these nations wrongly attributed the calamities that befell Israel to the inability of Jehovah to protect his people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Why is Ezekiel called “son of man”? (Eze 47:6) [Sept. 11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font0">-2 1001] </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah uses this designation apparently to emphasize that the prophet is simply an earthling, thus heightening the contrast between the human spokesman and the Source of his message, the Most High God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Why will God’s Kingdom have to crush the earthly rulerships depicted in the image? (Da 2:44) [Sept. 18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font0"> 6/15 17, box; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w01</span><span class="font0"> 10/15 6 </span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font0">4] </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Because these insist on perpetuating the Goddefying spirit of self-determination promoted by Satan back in the garden of Eden. In addition to working against mankind’s best interests, those who strive to perpetuate that spirit put themselves on a collision course with the Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">4. What did the immense tree in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream represent? (Da 4:10, 11, 20-22) [Sept. 25, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font0"> 9/1 18 </span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font0">5] </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The tree initially represented Nebuchadnezzar as the ruler of a world power. Since the rulership extended “to the ends of the whole earth,” however, the tree must signify something far grander. Daniel 4:17 connects the dream to the rulership of “the Most High” over mankind. The tree, then, also symbolized Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, especially with respect to the earth. Therefore, the dream has two fulfillments—in Nebuchadnezzar’s rulership and in Jehovah’s sovereignty.</span></p></li></ul>

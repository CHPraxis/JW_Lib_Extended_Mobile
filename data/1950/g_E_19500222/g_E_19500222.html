<p><span class="font3">INSIDE THE ITALIAN BOOT</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!” correspondent In Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">S</span><span class="font17">TILL badly bruised and bleeding* the world staggers to its feet to face another <sup>fC</sup>holy year” in 1950. In Italy it is called </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Anno Santo</span><span class="font17"> and great prospects are in view. Among other things, it will bring a gOodly influx of dollars, pounds and pesos as an anticipated two million pilgrims and tourists converge upon the “Eternal City” Rome in response to papal invitation. The pope, expressing hope that 1950 would result in “the return of humanity to God”, declared it the year of “the great return&quot;. Whether or not it will be so in a spiritual sense leaves room for conjecture. But all indications favor a substantial return in the numbers of visitors to Italy and Rome as world travel agencies gear themselves for the heavy traffic expected. However, when the travelers arrive, what will they find? Inside the water-bounded boot what is taking place ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">First you must cast an approving eye over the natural beauty of the land / its scenic spots would be hard to match. Up in the north, the stolid, snow-tipped peaks of the Italian Alps reach up into the blue, making wide-eyed passengers crane their necks upward from passing trains to take in the full height of their beauty. Just to the south and following the Po river eastward spreads out the fertile Fadana plain, in whose center throbs the nation's industrial heart, IJi-lan, first in economic importance and second only to Rome in population. The curving coastline to the west delights the tourist with its unparalleled climate and seaside resorts that have made famous the Italian Riviera. But the coastline on the east offers picturesque Venice, whose streets are paved with water and whose romantic setting makes it ideal for an Italian honeymoon. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Una gondola^ Si<sub>ft </sub>signore!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Like a rock-ribbed backbone, the Ap-ennine mountains run the length of the boot, making many an Italian farm slant steeply; yet the farmers till the slopes. Ah! then there is Rome, rich in its tradition and historic ruins, its culture and priceless works of art, resting as of old upon its seven hills while the greencolored Tiber snakes its way in and out. And here is found also the center of attraction for the &quot;holy year”: the temporal kingdom of the Vatican City state from which the vast spiritual domain of the pope reaches out to embrace 345,000,000 people throughout the world. Traveling 130 miles farther to the south one finds gay Napoli, gay despite its misery, while across its beautiful bay sulks the menacing Mt, Vesuvius. The prolific fruit-producing island of Sicily at Italy’s toe tip and the rectangular island of Sardinia complete our geographical sketch. But what about its size and population? Italy has approximately 46,000,000 inhabitants; so if you take</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">about one-third of the population of the, 48 United States and aqneeae it into an area slightly smaller than California, you Will have an idea of what Italy is up against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Political Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">century ago</span><span class="font10"> Italy was divided into many small, jealous kingdoms and dukeihnus, including a large territory over which the papacy ruled. Years of hitter struggle finally united </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">them</span><span class="font10"> all together under the fighting zeal of Gari-baldi. Victor Emmanuel 11 assumed the title of King of Italy, and with the subjugation of the papal state in 1S70 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rome </span><span class="font10">became the capital of the new kingdom. Then began much-needed reforms; railroads, streets and schools were built, and colonies acquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On October 28, 1922, in the wake of postwar disorder, the black-shirted forces of Mussolini’s fascists effected their “Marell on Rotne”, and a new regime began. It ended sadly fur the Italian people, after plunging them inlo the abyss of war </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font10"> which they have yet to recover. After the nsra new democracy was formed, and the nalion began putting the broken ends together. Anew, liberal Constitution wae produced in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1945,</span><span class="font10"> Article 7 of which, however, renews the marriage bond between Church and State by declaring the Mussolini-signed Lateran-Tresty of 1 929 still valid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Today, no sooner does one enter Italy than he realizes something is brewing politically. The government is sharply divided between loft wing Communists and right wing Christian Democrats. In the controversy the newspapers violently take sides, leaning either to the right or to the left, with a few trying hard to remain independent but not always succeeding. Thus, in regard to the government’s failure to apprehend the notorious Sicilian bandit. Giuliano, who has eluded an army of police for several years, tile conservative </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">II Tempo</span><span class="font10"> observed' “What is the new democracy doing! Hasn't it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">any laws! Haan’t it the necessary powers 1 Hasn't it the will and energy to ensure respect for law and defend public safety ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The highly independent II Memento got in a crack at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">girverimenfe extensive</span><span class="font10"> ''morality drive” which outlaws kissing in public and wearing abbreviated bathing suits: &quot;Banditism represents at least an serious an offense against morals as does naked shoulders,&quot; Such straining at a bathing suit and swallowing a bandit seems typical of the influence of the clergy who are famous for their ‘'morality drives&quot; the world over but who neglect to provide that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">whinh</span><span class="font10"> is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the best </span><span class="font10">defense against immorality: true knowledge of Ged’s Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because of the political discord, .the debates in tho Chamber of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Deputies Kild </span><span class="font10">in the Senate provide plenty* of action these days. On occasion, the heat of argument has passed the name-calling stage aud erupted in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the swinging of fists </span><span class="font10">and ehair-l.lirowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agriculture and industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In southern Italy, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a minority</span><span class="font10"> of wealthy barons, annuls and countesses own vast uncultivated domains, actually feudal inheritances. The poor farmers, poverty-stricken, with hungry motif Its at home crying for food, have been driven by desperation to become &quot;Equattprs,&quot; on this idle land, cultivating portions of it to provide some necessities of life for their families. The alternative is to starve. Learning of this encroachment on their property, the opulent landowners summon the authorities, and what results is well typified by the following incident reported in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">IlPaene:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font9"> group of unemployed farmers, living in tire moat, squalid misery, were intent on oe copying a small area rtf land belonging to the Marquis Anselmo Berlingeri, land cm which had grown every kind of weed, not having been cultivated or tilled for at least twenty years, About 4 p.m. the farmers were attracted by the roar of acamionefte of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Cetere&quot;</span><span class="font9"> (meeh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">urized police), with a hundred militiamen aboard, commanded by the marshal of the Garttitiuen from Gird. . * ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The farmers, in their innocence far from supposing what would happen, welcomed with joyous cheering the appearance of the “Celere&quot; police. But these, armed with pistols, submachine guns and hand grenades, hurriedly descended and made threateningly for the workers ol the still. Reaching the farmers* who stood immovable and astonished, they rounded them up together with the women, pushing the men and boys with Lite butts of their submachine guns. The poor farmers, with only their boos for weapons of defense, tried in vain with words to placate this unsuspected ' police fury, and then decided it was best io retreat, while the jvomcn and youngsters took to their heels, terrified. Then the police, for motives unusually difficult tn explain, hurled a number of hand grenades at their backs and fired their sub-machine guns. A 15-year-old boy, Francencn Zito, fell on his face in a pool of blood, his shoulders riddled with bullets; a few steps away, SB-year-old Francesco Nigro collapsed Lu the giuund will) large, mortal wounds in his back. . . , thirteen of the wounded </span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wqtc</span><span class="font14"> taken to the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Other shootings followed. In protest against such police action a nation wide strike was called by all bus and tram operators, paralyzing the country’s transportation system, president of the Council, De Qaspen, visited the trouble areas in Calabria to pacify the farmers with promises of putting into effect certain agricultural reforms long overdue. But already many lives have been lost in the bitter struggle between the hungry peasants and rich landholders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But surely the condition is better for the workingman in the city, is it nut? In Naples, Some, Genoa, Palermo and other large cities one sees bright store windows filled with all inarmer of fashionable clothes, rich-looking bolts of cloth, household goods, and every other necessity. The colorful markets that fill the piazzas daily are well-stocked with fruits, vegetables, fish and meats. Truly there ia no scarcity. But who can buy these products on the salary of the average laborer who earns from $1.00 to $2.00 a day? A railroad worker, for instance, may earn 30,000 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">lire</span><span class="font16"> monthly, which is less than $50.00. Yet beef costs 70c a pound, or half a day’s wages. Butter is 83c a pound. Coal, $30.00 per ton. A man's suit will cost $45.00, while a pair of shoes runs from $fi.5O ami up. In one family^ the husband is working 14-16 hours a day, his wife worka about 6 hours, and together they earn L.1000, or $1.50, to support themselves and three children. How can one properly feed, fclothe and medically care for a large family on that amountf And whet about those poor unfortunates who cannot obtain a joh of any kind! The unemployed number dose to two million. Beggars abound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is in this discouraging economic ahyss that thousands of Italians exist today. An Tfalian journalist reflected this seemingly hopeless condition recently while inspecting the unbelievably bestial con di Lions under which the sulphur mine workers of Sicily labor and live. Moved by the sight of back-breaking IhIxh\ filth, poverty, large families of ragged, shoeless, skinny children, he muttered: &quot;Why are these people living!” And;'in truth, were it not for the will in man to live, ami to live in hope that some day things will be better, it would all seem so futile, vain.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Religion's Contribution</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">But has Italy's religion, which should offer hope and enlightenment to the pfo-ple, made it a better place in wliich to Eve! For all its 1,600years of existence, influence and opportunity to help the Italian people, what has she to show! </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font16"> man who lived on earth 19 centuries ago, imbued with more than human wisdom, declared: “For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit; nor an evil tree that bringethtf'orth good fruit. For every tree is known by its fruit?'—Luke 6: 43,44, Dotwiy Verst ow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is this combination of economic poverty and clerical political connivance that is fructifying the seedbed of Communism in Italy. To stem the rising tide, the Catholic Church threw all her weight into the 1948 elections to prevent a Communist victory. Monks, nuns end priests, many of whom had been secluded from the world in cloisters and convents, showed up at the polls to vote. An unprecedented sight, but it worked! The Christian Democrats scored a majority* However, more and more Catholics—many alienated from the clergy by their tactics during Fascism and the war —began to show increasing sympathy toward Communism, and the pope was constrained to apply his most powerful weapon, excommunication. Each one must decide: arc you a Catholic, or a CommunistT You cannot be both. In a nation traditionally bound io the Church as is Italy, the decree had its effect with many who were “on the fence”, but with others it was “the straw that broke the camel’s back” and they became more hardened </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font16"> their anticJericalism,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If prayers and religious blessings count, Italy’s health ought to be tops. Probably no other one nation in the world has as many churches per square mile, whose citizenry pray oftener or longer before images of saints and madonnas, than right here in Italy. Vet it seems not to be the most blessed. Priests and people prayed fervently during the last war, but suffered miserably at the hands of both friends and enemies. Their cities were hollowed out by bombs, and when the useless war was ended it was found that neither saints nor madonnas had protected husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, women and children. For all this the clergy had an answer. From their pulpits they unashamedly declared that this was a just punishment from God justly executed upon a sinful people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But the reasoning mind rebels at this! Are these people more sinful than those</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">in the many countries left unscathed or less damaged by the war! Have not these prayed and confessed and partaken of communion as much as and more than other peoples! And here in Italy is the very heart of the “Christian religion”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Religion in Daily Life</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">But turn now to the religious aspect of Italy. It permeates every phase of daily life. It affeets the customs, habits, and even their dress. It influences them strongly in both social and political affairs. Religion is compulsory in f.Fie schools, where young minds are early indoctrinated. Statues of saints are placed in special niches cut. in the exterior of most buildings and in the entranceway of apartment houses. The part played by images of saints, and particularly of the Madonna, is very significant in tne Italian’s worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">High iifi on a mountain near Genoa rests a little sanctuary. It was built on the spot where, three or four centuries ago’, h । &gt;e as a nt is reported to have seen the “Blessed Virgin”. According to the tradition, the vision requested him to build a church there, but when he excitedly told his wife about, it she ridiculed him with scorn. So he said no more. Some time later, confined to bed by an injury, he beheld in a night vision the Madonna repeating her request. Miraculously cured soon after, the story continues, he proclaimed to everyone what had happened; his account was believed and the religious leaders saw to the building of both a church and a chapel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Within the chapel reposes h life-size statue of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Madonna della Guardia,</span><span class="font16"> the baby Jesus in her arms, and the old peasant kneeling before her, hands clasped in worshipful attitude. At the foot of her altar is a basket and, as we look, the simple folk who come to pray and light a candle addlheir contribution to the pile of Italian </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">lire already</span><span class="font16"> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Farther up the road a little carnival is going on, with hucksters of every de-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">scription. There is a restaurant and hotel for those who come to stay and pray for several days, local stores offer religious knickknacks for sale/ stories of the Madonna’s miracles, etc. Upon entering the church in the square, we hear the priest discoursing about the Madonna, and note his words as he declares: “Next to the Blessed Trinity, Mary appears as the greatest thing in the Christian religion. Why? Because she was chosen by God the Father to be the mother of His son and finally she conceived by the Holy Ghost. This means she was married to the Holy Ghost?’ It was Mary that had always helped the Church in its hour of distress, and so he called upon her to defend the Church against Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We leave the building, calling to mind the simple Jewish woman, Mary, of the tribe of Judah, who knew little of and cared less for politics, and who loved God too much to ever want so much adulation given her. In her day she knew Hie Scriptures declared: “I the Lord, this is my name*. I will not give rny glory to another, nor my praise to graven things.” —Isaias 42: 8, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Douag Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Idolatrous Procession</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Last spring, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Madonna della guardia</span><span class="font17"> left her retreat on Mt. Figogna and was carried into Genoa. For weeks in advance, wall posters and church announcements notified everyone that the Madonna was to make a parish-to-parish pilgrimage. As the day approaches, the excitement heightens; feverish preparations are made; a sign appears in lights on the church facade, '‘Come, 0 Alary!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Then one evening the movement in the streets below gives evidence that the long-awaited hour is near. Sometime tonight the Madonna will come. Women and children are seen carrying candles, shielded in a cone of white paper to protect the flame from tbe wind. Draperies, special banners, blankets and even bedspreads are hung from every window. Though it is an hour before midnight, the illumina-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">tion makes everything day-bright, throwing into clear relief the packed procession now entering the street to the right. The air is filled with the muffled murmuring of thousands, the scuffling of shoes on the pavement, the shouts of children, and the boom of a loudspeaker thundering above it all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now the noise changes as the throng joins unevenly in a song of supplication to the “Biased Virgin”, th^ thin, InmfeTit-ing wail of feminine voices drowning out the fewer masculine notes. The crowd comes nearer. In the lead are a number of men walking in loose order; a soundcar precedes the float of the Madonna carried aloft on the shoulders of twelve men; on each side are the ever-present </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">carabinieri,</span><span class="font17"> rifles slung over shoulders; and finally the mass of the procession, jamming the street behind and overflowing onto the sidewalks, lips moving in hymn or in prayer, eyes fixed on the image, the ground, or gazing up at the windows above. The cone-shielded candles and several torches add a weird lighting effect to an already fantastic scene. Spasmodically as it had begun, the singing stops; the &quot;Virgin&quot; is immediately below us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In front of the Madonna walks a hlack-robed priest, beside the powerful soundcar. His heavy, amplified voice splits the night with a phrase in Latin. The multitudes mumble the response in unintelligible discord. Tbew the, priest's vVite again, followed by the chant of the heaving, moving mass'. Thus down the street they pass: the stiff, inert image of the Madonna inclining and veering, bobbing and swaying, utterly impassive and unresponsive, borne along on the uncertain crest of the tide of worshipers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Scenes such as these are very common throughout the length and breadth of Italy. To the mind leap the words of the Bible: “The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men. They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and sec not. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not. They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not.” —Psalm 113:4-7, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Bible Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">In the midst &lt;jf all this veneration of images, burning of candles, “solemn” masses, pomp and procession, what is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font16">be said of the Bible? Is it widely distributed and readt AIhs! no. In but a meager number of homes is it found, American missionaries, who in recent months have been eon ducting a campaign of Bible education here, have lieen amazed to find ho few having copies of the Scriptures. N&lt;&gt;(. that Italians disdain God's </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Word;</span><span class="font16"> to the contrary; But they have not been encouraged to read it. When shown the Bible and allowed to scon its pages they express themselves elatedly over the wonderful truths they And. Ques lions by the dozens pour forth ou subjects long repressed by minds daring at last to think unharnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The endless experiences of these American missionaries, gradrmleff of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, give proof that the desire of Italians for enlightenment is battling its way up through the morass of superstition, h» breathe in finally the clear, fresh air of truth. They have distributed thousands of Bibles and Bible helps. They are conducting hundreds of family Bible studies weekly. Publie Bible tli^coursea arranged by them have packed out theaters, with an overflow in the street outside. From industrial Milan to Palermo, these missionaries, together with their Italian coworkers, are bringing new meaning to the lives of many hundreds of goodwill, farmers, lawyers, factory workers, housewives, clerks, cobblers, carpenters —jieople from every walk of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">All this has not been without its reaction, however. Under clerical inspiration, in Palermo, some of the Bible literature was gathered up-from the homes where it had been placed, and then burned in front &lt;d churches, while the rchgious newspapers dubbed the missionaries ‘‘wolves in angels’ clothing”. At Milan, both Catholic and Communist pressure shared in an attempt to deny Jehovah's witnesses a place io moeh It failed. In Genoa, a Catholic priest snatched a Bible from the hands of a missionary, refused to return it, and then brazenly defied him to report the matter to the police, knowing full well that the latter would give no heed. Religious intermeddling in government circles is working to deny the missionaries permission to remain in Italy to ch t ry on their benevolent activity. Everywhere, the clergy, fearful of the effect of Bible information in the bands of the people, have loudly and sternly warned their flockx riot to give ear. But the “eheep&quot; in. those flocks give ear nil the more. And despite it all, the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom’’ goes on apace, to end only when Almighty God so wills it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This, then, is a brief glimpse of Italy as it enters the “holy year”. Its problems arc many. But they are not problems created solely by the war. The roots go farther back. They are tbe same difficulties to be found in one form or another in every nation of this dying old world. Not in Communism nor in Catholicism is the solution to be found. The answer is found only in God's established kingdom by Christ Jesus, under which this penins nla of friendly, mu sic-loving, sensitive people will begin to enjoy true prosperity and peace. In that Kingdom the people of good-will of all nations arc placing their hope today, turning from this world’s politics and religion even while the pope taps the door of St. Peter's with his gilded hammer and the “holy year” begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">T</span><span class="font16">HE old cry of “What this world needs is more religion” has a competitor. This competing, cure-all prescribed for tho political mess is “What this country needs is a woman president!”Or at least, “Let’s have more women in political offices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Advocates ask if anyone could more appreciate the problems of home, school, and civic improvement. Indeed, women do the marketing; aren't they more familiar with, and hence better equipped to handle, inflation and the rising cost of livingf Wouldn’t the mother-instinct curb the repetitious sacrifice of sons in war? Wouldn’t they apply house-cleaning l.adica toward ward heelers, civic rol.len-ness, graft, and dirty politics in general T Who would have deeper insight into problems of health facilities, housing, educational systems and the intricacies of equal-status, since her own “liability” of being a woman was one she had to con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thousands cry that women are surely the answer. “If women controlled the unions and politics of this world,” one speaker avers, “we wouldn’t have millions unemployed, nor would we have hundreds of thousands starving while we have plenty to eat. The influence of women has kept men from being worse animals than they are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Lady Astor thinks women’s peacemaking activities are among the future’s surest hopes. “Just wait another 50 years, we’ve got a lot of mistakes to undo,” she promises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">“The world is governed by cunning, selfish men, who go into politics with axes to grind, whereas women instinctively and universally are prone to place human needs firsL . , . After thousands of years of blundering man-rule, woman might take matters in hand and succeed where man has shamefully failed.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Woman*a Rise Politically</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">But the trend for a feminine “champion of the people” has far exceeded public opinion and conversational topic. Harvard Law School, for the first time in its 132 years, has opened its portals to women applicants. Public administration is Hinong the courses now open to women applicants. Gone are the days when the Victorian Miss thought ward heelers were district shoe makers, a lobby merely-a reception room, planks just so much lumber, and the Department of the Interior existed solely to devise a “new look” for her little nest. Actually, women’s political appointments are appearing almost daily. Ever since Susan Anthony's fight for her underprivileged sisters won its final triumph in 1920, women have forsaken home by the range and become mayors, senators, representatives of the House, ninljnssadors, members of the cabinet, director of th£ LJ. S. mint, secretary of labor, ministers to Norway, Denmark, Luxemburg, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While foreign nations have long accepted woman's administrative reign, its ascent in the United States has been a slow and hard-fought process. The early crusader a for equal political rights received taunts anil jeers, and sometimes physical violence for their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On duly 19, 1848, the first Women’s Bight's convention was held. Many women were active in this movement— Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Stanton, Angelina Grimke and Lucretia Mott being some of the outstanding figures. Most prominent of al], however, was the aforementioned Busan D. Anthony, who did some very effective organizing and leading of the group. In 1854 and 1855 she held conventions in each county in New York to pro-motw woman suffrage. In 1868 she and two others began to publish a paper called tho “Revolution! si”, devoted to a further pica of the cause. At the sialo and congressional elections in J872 at Rochester, N. Y., she cast ballots to clar-<sup>h </sup>ify the application of the four teen th and fifteenth amendments, which guarantee protection of the rights and privileges of U.S. citizens. For this she was proclaimed guilty of voting illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After Mrs. Anthony’s death the various women's leagues continued cam-. paigning, rallying, parading, In 1919 Congress finally yielded and women were at last recognized in the administrative processes. From that time forward the advance of female supervision has grown considerably. Women are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">here!—</span><span class="font16">to stay ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Is the world now safer for democracy T Have women established any revolution^ ary democratic beachheads ? Have problems of home, school, and civic improvement been remedied thus far? Have the unemployed millions been reduced by woman's 30-year advent? Or have they, too, taken a course like their ^blunder-ing&quot;, “aniinal-like” fellow, man, and gone the way of all flesh?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Offeuttin^ the thousands who cry for more political petticoats, other thousands range in opposition. One published opinion: ‘Tn spite of the purifying effects of the coming of women </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">into politic </span><span class="font16">cal ai'livities it is open to a group of critics to say that as much graft, as much corruption, as much malfeasance in office exists as at any time during the present century/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Catholic dignitary Edward Lodge Curran states that the nineteenth amendment granting women the right to vote instead of being &quot;the beginning of a new era of cleaner polities has been a hopeless failure. . . . They winked at the abuses in their own political organizations just as much as men; they yielded to the same specious arguments and paid tribute to the same ward heelers and grafters&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some time ago a member of the National Labor Relations Board declared that a large njjjuber of women’s appoint^ monte were purely through political influence. Same old story I</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is strongly believed that women have no natural aptitude for leadership. Thftir instincts are to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">follow. Tko domineering</span><span class="font16"> wife lias never made for happiness in any matrimonial venture. The Bible, too, corroborates this: “The head of the woman is the man.” Mother Eve wanted to blaze a new trail in leadership, hence the world's woes. A not so splendid ad for the “women instinctively place human needs first” plank in the platform of feminine rule I</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Women really haven't faith in women. A writer for the N.Y. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font16"> observes, “If women were to use their votes as women they could control every election as a solid block; they could vote women into every important office in the land, even create a Madame President for the United States. In point of fact, women appear very reluctant to vote power to ■other women; presumably they cannot make the laws personally they prefer to delegate the authority to men. Maybe they do not trust other women to exercise authority with discretion; maybe they are right”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another danger of woman's dominance 13 the smothering power of raatcmalism. Many a man’s stamina has been stifled from little up, beginning with <sup>Tf</sup>Maniii knows beet&quot;, then, “Now listen to teacher,&quot; then, “After all, I </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">am</span><span class="font16"> your motherin-law t” To have some motherly political monarch reign over him would be die final crushing blow to any remaining male self-r^pect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Of course there's always the woman's-place-ie-in-the home angle. Another country heard from—Egypt (which has been confronted with a uhw suffragette movement). A spokesman for the leading political party there opines: “The Egyptian nation does not desire a new feminist party. The Egyptian woman dons not need anything of the sort because woman has a place in society that must not be neglected for Htiollmr. She must occupy herself with the home and preparation of the new generation.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W/w </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Shall Ruler,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">. From the viewpoint of Jehovah God's infallible Word, the Bible, are women the future’s surest liopvb? Will they be the cure-all for this political mess F Emphatically, No! Why not? The Bible states that soon this earth will no more be subject to experimental rule by woman, nor to imperfect, blundering man, but that the nations and their crooked, warped political set-ups are without exception to be dashed in pieces like some old clay pots! (Psalm 2) A righteous government shall be over all the earth, without ward heelers, civic rottenness, graft and dirty polities; without crooked elections, stuffed ballot boxes and political pull, and even with out sickness, sorrow, and death. (And let’s see any political party match that, even in its rosy, empty campaign promises!) But it wul rain down permanent life, justice, security and happiness for ever and ever,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“For unto us a child is bom, unto us a son is givpn; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace&lt; Of the increasH of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, hi order it, and to establish it with, judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this/’—Isaiah 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The honest conclneion must be: The petticoats in politics slip and show the same imperfections hk the pants in polities. Christ's kingdom rule is the only hope for perfect government.—Mdtthew 12:21, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Sian. V</span><span class="font16">er.</span></p>

So great were her agonies that she Jed the blind Samson to the pillars holding up the Philistine temple, aod when Samson pulled the temple down upon himself and the populace, Delilah made no attempt to escape.

<p><span class="font14">“At least that’s the way it happens in Mr. DeMille’s new movie, 'Samson and Delilah?

These and other accurate scenes were foretastes that whetted the appetite for what never came, were as teasers to show what might have been.

<p><span class="font16">Yes, almost any of the islands of the tropical Pacific are a delight. But the Hawaiian Islands, first called the Sandwich Islands by Captain Cook of the British Navy (1778), are not merely some of earth's most colorful spots. Jn addition? their equable climate, productive fertility, advanced knowledge of coif government, economic strength and strategic location endow them generously for their place as &quot;gateway to the South Pacific”, Mark Twain found them &quot;the loveliest fleet of islands Hint lie anchored in any ocean&quot;; while that great exponent of civil liberty, Abraham Lincoln, found in them an early kinship with the American ideal.

Since then Hawaii has been h. territory for some fifty years and still is not a state. Many people in government and out, and the great majority of Hawaiian3, are urgently if not indignantly asking, Why!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Qualifications for Statehood</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">More than two years ago, the then secretary of the interior, J. A. Krug, on his return from a 24,000-mile tour of the Pacific, vigorously recommended Hawaii's admission as a state. Concluding his outline of Hawaiian history through its stages of absolute monarchy to its annexation (1898) and organization as a territory (1900), his position was made emphatic: “I do not care what standard you apply—whether it is population, devotion to American ideals, the effect upon the nation in foreign affairs, wealth, ability for self-government or social consciousness, Hawaii passes the test/’ It seems that in view of al) the evidence Hawaii has the highest qualifications and the strongest case in favor of being admitted to statehood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One reason that most Americans are not familiar with is the fact that when Hawaii was annexed to the United States in 1898 she was an independent republic with world recognition. Annexation actually took place only after several futile attempts du the part of Hawaii ana. Every attempt of the ’land of the hula girls” to bring herself into the American family seemed to find Uncle Sam hiding behind his beard. One treaty of annexation was killed by the Senate in 1854, another was tabled by President Grover Cleveland four years prior to the Spanish-American War. Only after Dewey won the Battle of Manila in 1898 was the annexation put through by McKinley. In 1900 the Organic Act, establishing Hawaii's government as a territory', was passed and the islands still continue under thin establishment. For four full years after the summer of 1894, when Cleveland recognized the infant republic, Hawaii continued as an accepted member of the family of nations. Even from thia single fact all doubts as to whether Hn-wa liana cun govern themselves should be entirely erased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The only other facts of historical interest concerning the Hawaiian islands are that they we r e peopled by Polynesian seamen unknown centuries ago, and came to world attention first in 1778 when Cap tain JairjcH Cook of the British Navy touched these idyllic isles and with singular lack of imagination dabbed them the Sandwich Islands, after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich. Between 1816 and 1850, successively the Russians, British and French unsuccessfully attempted to take over the islands. Native rulers held sway until Queen Liliuokalani was deposed in 1893, but “by the close of the nineteenth century, a small coterie of Americans had succeeded in acquiring two-thirds of all the taxable real estate in the islands'<sup>7</sup>. This group is fairly well perpetuated today in what is known as the Big Five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Succinctly, the Hawaii Statehood Commission has arrayed a formidable battery of additional arguments in support of their statehood plea. As to stse, Hawaii's land surface of fl,435 square miles constitutes an urea slightly larger than the states of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined- It approximates the size of New Jersey. As to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">population,</span><span class="font16"> its 540,000 total, of which 85 to 90 percent arc American citizens, exceeds that of six states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Financial Status</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Is it a dowry Uncle Sam seeks before leading the little lady to the altar of statehood T As to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">wealth,</span><span class="font16"> the islands have been stuffing their unappreciative Uncle's coffers for a half century. In fact, Hawaii is an outstandingly paying investment shining like a jewel among Uncle Sam's increasingly vast number of losing ventures. Hawaii should be treasured more. It is not only solvent but is helping to pay for Uncle’s extravagances. After considering the facts up to this point even most stern Yankees would give up and marry the girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But there is more. The territory pays taxes to the federal government greater than those paid by 14 states. Its gross taxable income is more than a billion dollars; real estate valuation $500,000,000. Excluding military appropriations, the United States spends only about $13,-000,000 on the average and receives in taxes for remission to Washington the comparatively staggering sum of $140,-000,000. The lady is evidently nut only paying her way but furnishing a good many free rides. In 1945, a ‘’peak<sup>17</sup> year, Hawaii added $173,000,000 to the federal coffers. It is not surprising to learn further that in 1947 the percentage of the Hawaiian population filing individual income tax returns was higher than that of 26 states of the union. From 1939 to 1946 while the continental U. S. was multiplying her bonded indebtedness, Hawaii reduced hers from $28,511,458 to $9,237,835, a sixty-eight percent cut. According to this the American taxpayer could afford to send Washington’s budgetary experts over for a year's training, to be taught how the llawaiians did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It might be of interest to pause in the eon rid era Lion of the arguments for Hawaii's admission and explore the source of the islands' income. Agriculture, depending upon Hawaii’s tremendous rainfall, which Teaches as much as 600 inches annually on the island of Kauai, supports the islands. More specifically, the two crops that are Hawaii’s breadwinners are sugar, first, and pineapple, second. Sugar, upon which the economy of Hawaii has depended so largely for the last ten years, reached the value of a hundred million dollars for a crop of 975,000 tons average for tho ten years prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. The sugar industry lias been largely Hull by the world-famous coterie called the Big Five, whose interlocking directorates once controlled the island. (Now the power of the Big Five is waning, giving way to well organized labor unions under the C.LO.) One-fourth of the sugar used by the United States comes from Hawaii. As for pineapple, not far behind sugar in value, Hawaii furnishes 90 percent of the world’s canned supply. The third industry is the tourist trade, which, though it collapsed during the war, has now exceeded prewar levels to the tune of $33 million in 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Japanese-Americans carry’ on a thriving and picturesque tuna industry on their slippery, rail!ess gampans. Manufacturing is limited chiefly to pineapple and fish produclH. More important than sea products, however, is beef-raising, ho greatly stimulated by war shortages. By 1945 Hawaii boasted a total of 141,800 head of cattle. On the island of Hawaii the Parker cattle ranch claims to hold second place to Texas King ranch in size. IL has a “spread” of 500,000 acres. Of commercial importance also, though in much smaller degree, is the raising of coffee and the macadamia nut. Though comprising less than ten percent of the islands, the tillable area produces “more calories per acre than any other land in the world”. Thus water, soil and sunshine supply Hawaii's abundant riches.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">In a Land where the educational system has been developed to a liigher standard than in some parts of the United States, where illiteracy among the native born is npHi;ly nonexistent, some opponents of statehood urge the dangers of Japanese or Communist political control. The 1949 congressional booklet </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">State-Jiood for Alaska</span><span class="font16"> gave these population figures for Hawaii's different races: Caucasian American 177,580 {33.4 percent); Japanese-American 144,640 (32.6 percent, in addition to 31,640 alien Japanese) ; Hnwaiians and part-Hawaii a ns 80,760; Chinese-Americans 28,180; Filipinos, Puerto Ricans, Knrraim make up the total of 540,000. The opponents urged two objections to the Japanese, disloyalty during Ihe war and habitual blocvoting The charge of betraying, the American forces and strategic locations, such as hangars and air fields, at the time of the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor was completely disproved by Federal Bureau of Investigation. The generally accepted story, for example, that Hawaiian-Japanese cut arrows in the sugar fields to direct enemy planes to bombing targets was libelous fabrication. “Robert Tj. Shivers, former Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Honolulu from August 1939 to April 1943 . . . emphatically ata ted that every such rumor of [Japanese] treachery was utterly false/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As to bloc-voting the record states: &quot;The racial composition of the Hawaiian legislature in 1940 presented rather conclusive evidence that bloc-voting has not been practiced by any racial group save, possibly, the Chinese. Of the forty-five legislators [bicameral, 30 members of the housp<sub>T</sub> 15 senators] only three were Japanese; on a population ratio the Japanese should have numbered thirteen. On the same basis the whites were entitled to fifteen seats, hut actually held twenty-one. The Hawniiaus, rating twelve seats, boasted seventeen. But the Chinese with a theoretical ratio of four legislators were represented by exactly that number, ” Apparently the Japanese are inclined to vote according to political, social and economic motives rather than according to racial loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The summary of opinion is to the effect that Hawaii is the true “melting pot” where the different races and peoples get along with much more amity and harmony than in many states of the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab to the communist question, this has been argued pro and con. It has been spotlighted hy the Bridges’ organizathm of all Hawaiian labor under the C.I.O. Chief Hawaiian branch was the 1LWU (International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, responsible for the recent crippling strike). In 1947, through C.LO.-P.A.C. democrats the legislature whs almost dominated by the Beds. The effect on the statehood question is that Congress docs not want any communist representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">About the only other objection to Hawaii’s becoming a state, besides the U. S. Senate’s party concern as to whether the almost equally divided constituents of Hawaii would elect democrat or republican senators, and representatives (two), is that the eight principal islands of the archipelago arc about 2,400 air miles from the mainland at the closest point. They, like Alaska, are not “contiguous and compact” with the other states,. Refuting this point it is argued that France made Algiers a “department”, though not contiguous, without ill results; that California had no closer state than Texas when admitted. In addition Hawaii is as close in time today to Washington, D.C., as all but the adjacent states were when the capital was first located there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On November 14 Hawaii's determined campaign to become a state gained impetus as Territorial Governor Stainback signed a proclamation calling for an election to name delegates to a constitutional convention. The announcement set up the following schedule: (1) a primary election on February 11, (2) a final election on March 21 for chonsing sixty-three convention delegates, and (3) the calling to order of a constitutional convention on April 4, 1950. After the constitution is drafted, it will be studied by the legislature, which in turn will submit it to the public for a vote. If ratified by the public it becomes the basic law of ihe slate of Hawaii, if and when Congress grants statehood to Hawaii. Hawaii will be the first territory in sixty years to draft a slate constitution without prior authorization from Congress. But fifteen.of the present forty-eight states followed a similar course. So the advance drafting of a state constitution, according to fifteen precedents, will not jeopardize Hawaii's statehood chances and will certainly save time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In general both people and press favor Hawaii's becoming a state. It is now virtually blocked by the United States Sen-, ate alone. What the present Senate will do is the big question.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">WRITING</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO INVENTED IT ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">N</span><span class="font17">OT so long ago people believed that Moses was the first to invent writing, doing so in order to carry out God's commandment: “The Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book/’ (Exodus 17:14) However, many Bible critics pooh-poohed the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, claiming that writing was invented long after Moses died. Archaeologists, however, have in recent years, dug up indisputable proof that both these former theories are wrong. Writing, it has been learned, was at a high state of development many centuries before Moses' day. Who, then, was the first to write: Abraham? Noah? Enoch? Seth? or Adam?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Twenty-three of our alphabetic letters came from the Romans of 2,000 years ago. They had taken IS of them from the Greeks about the fourth century before Christ, The Greeks in turn had picked up 15 of them from Phoenician traders in the early part of the eighth century B.C. Where the Phoenicians got them is an unanswered question. Maybe they fabricated some of the letters themselves or maybe they drew upon Cretan, Assyrian, Babylonian or Egyptian sources, “These are questions,” says 0. F. Ege, “that probably will never be answered satisfactorily. Many arguments and theories are advanced,&quot; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(The Story</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the Alphabet) A</span><span class="font17"> couple of years ago it was announced that “the. oldest form of characters from which the English alphabet originated&quot;, dating back to the 15th century B.C., had been found in the Sinai peninsula. From this, let none jump to the erroneous conclusion that writing had its beginning in the Sinai peninsula or in the 15th century B.C. A century earlier, Moses had begun the writing of the Pentateuch, A century before that, in the 17th eenfciry B.C,, the righteously disposed Job was familiar with the art of writing.—Job 19:23,24, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt;</span><span class="font17"> Job 31: 35, 36, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Sir Frederic Kenyon, the noted archaeologist, pointing to the Prisse Papyrus in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris (Nos. 183-194), written in hieroglyphics during the 12th dynasty some time between 2200 and z!000 B.C., declares: “We thus have from Egypt an actual manuscript which was written before the end of the third millenium B.C., and the works contained in it, if we are to believe their own statements, were composed respectively in the fourth millennium, and early in the third.&quot; Egypt, the first world power, was busy carving its hieroglyphics centuries before Moses began writing the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oldest Writings Yet Found</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In 1887 (A.D.) more than 350 clay tablets were found in Egypt about 160 miles south of the Nile delta, tablets written in cuneiform, meaning “wedge-shaped&quot;, instead of in hieroglyphics. Cuneiform writing originated in the Mesopotamian valley, in that part of the world now known as Iraq; and since it is a more ancient form than hieroglyphics, the search for the original source of writing shifted from the valley of the Nile to the alluvial plains between the twin rivers of the Euphrates and Tigris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Diggings in this cradle of civilization unearthed about a quarter of a million clay tablets and inscriptions. Some of the tablets are syllabic cuneiform and some are an even older form of writing, a kind of writing identified as belonging to the Sumerians, a people who lived in that part of the world before the ancient Babylonians. Some of the tablets dis</span><span class="font16">covered at Ur of the Chaldees and at the city of Kish Were “the most primitive writings of all, which can hardly be later than 3500 B.C?’, saya Kenyon, The Sumerians lived in the days of Xoah, who died at the age of 950 years, two years before Abraham was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Concerning tho writing of the Sumerians, some authorities believe they simplified an even older form of writing known us pictographic, in which each sign was a picture resembling some object or word. One noted authority ia this field of investigation, G. R. Driver, observes that at tho same period of time that abstract sign-writing was in use, Sumerians were also u^iug the semi-piotographic form of writing. TTenite, Driver comes to the conclusion: “Possibly then, two distinct traditions of writing were current c. 3500-3000 B.C.; the abstradt signa employed at Ur and Lagash and the semi-pietographic characters of Elam and the district of Kish, As the two systems were practically contemporary, the one could not have been developed out of the other. . , . The only plausible conclusion in the present state of knowledge is that these two types of script are derived from a common -source?' </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">{Semitic Writing.</span><span class="font16"> 1SM8, pages 1, 2) When talking about &quot;'a common source” and in dealing with dates around 3,000 B.C. we are getting back before4hc flood of Noah's day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">JVriffjtff </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Before the flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is no indication that Noah or his descendants were the first to invent the art of writing. All the evidence points to the fact that people before the flood were ahle to write and did write. It is true that one cannot accept dates set by archaeologist* since sueb fail to tally with the authentic chronology of the Bible, and also because it is necessary that such dates be revised from time to time. For example, fifty years ago the archaeologists said tbe year of the accession of the ruler Hammurabi was </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">2342 </span><span class="font16">B.C- Now they estimate it to have been in the year 1728 B.C. But even if their dates* are further pared down with succeeding revisions, yet the material already dug up shows that people were writing five thousand years ago, people who lived before the flood, which according to the Bible is set at 2370 B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In view of the fact .th at actual records have been found that go back “certainly to the time of the First Dynasty of Kish, the first recorded to have ruled after the Flood'*, IJarold Peake admits the probability “that writing was known before that €*HtaKtri»2»be took place, for, os we have seen, a later tradition mentions written tablets, which were buried for safety during the Deluge”. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(The Flood, </span><span class="font16">1930, pages 76, 77) Josephus, the Jewish historian of 19 centuries ago, tells how the SSethitea {descendants of Adam’s bod Seth) made certain discoveries in astronomy «nd “inscribed&quot; their findings on two pillars, concerning which Josephus says: “Now this remains in the land of Sirind to this day?’ (Voafe </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">and His Times,</span><span class="font16"> J. M, Olmstead, 1354, page 52) And one of the archaeological findings, ujiitainiug n very significant statement by Ashurhanipal (called Osnappar in the Bible at Ezra 4:10, rim. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Stan.</span><span class="font16"> T^er.), says: “I had my joy in the reading of iascriptions on stone from the time before the flood.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And why think you that those people living prior to the flood were not capable of writing! It is only when so-called “scientists” ignore genuine scientific facts, and substitute for them the pagan theories of evolution, that they are led astray. Warped in their power to reason such men say that man was first a low-grade savage, than a high-grade savage; that from there he evoluted upward to be a lowbrow barbarian, then a Inghbrow barbarian; and that finally, through a slow process, he became “civilized&quot;*. They think that man's language followed the same pattern, that at first he only grunted, that later he learned to enunciate and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">syllabify his grunts, and that after eons of “baby talking” he finally learned to speak intelligently. Believing such a nonsensical theory, their final conclusion is that man’s written language followed a similar pattern of development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But not so! Adam and his wife Eve were able to converse intelligently with each other and with their Creator. It must therefore be admitted that such ability to speak was a wonderful gift from God their Creator, who made man’s mind and tongue to coordinate so he could give utterance to his thoughts. Before the flood men were well developed in the arts and sciences. The science of metallurgy they mastered. They were capable of smelting ore and forging instruments of copper and iron. Being highly cultured in the art of music, they were fully equipped to “handle the harp and organ”.—Genesis 4: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine the amazement that struck the evolution-minded archaeologists when they found instruments of iron and bronze and beautiful pottery, fully corroborating these truths! As an AP dispatch modestly expresses it, they found “a culture much higher than had been suspected”. Dumfounded, they could hardly believe their eyes when they found beautiful kiln-dried porcelain, bespeaking a very high development and dating back to the 4th millennium B.C.! Moreover, the mathematicians and engineers back there who built their cities, made mathematical measurements and astronomical calculations were not dullards or mentally doltish. Cuneiform tablets show they were able to figure out the square root of a number up to six decimal points, were able to determine the circumferences and diameters of circles and were ahle to make certain calcula- • tions in time. For such a brilliant people as that ancient race, mastering the art of writing surely was not too difficult a task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only do the diggings of the archaeologists in the Mesopotamian valley show</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">that writing was in use before the flood of Noah’s day, but also testimony within the Bible itself indicates that the first man, Adam, wrote. Genesis 5:1 states: “This is the book of the generations of Adam.” But other “generations” prior to these are mentioned, at Genesis 2:4: “These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created.” However, inanimate heavens and earth produce no generations. The Hebrew word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">toledoth</span><span class="font10"> here translated “generations” should be rendered “history”, or “family history”, or “origins” or “story of origin”. This particular expression translated “generations” is found eleven times in Genesis, and in addition to referring to the generations of heaven and earth and Adam, speaks of the generations of Noah, Shem, Terah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau and Jacob.—6: 9; 10:1; 11:10,27; 25:12,19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to modern style of composition these expressions may seem misplaced, but compiler Moses wrote in the ancient style as he received it, and revealed the source of the documents he incorporated into Genesis. In Moses’ day, and in the more than sixteen centuries prececding him, it was the literary style for a historical document to be concluded with the words, “These are the generations,” or, better translated, “This is the history,” of So-and-so, in this way to indicate who was the 'writer of the record or its owner. This expression is therefore not an introduction of what is to follow but a conclusion that names the writer or owner of the document. Other Scriptural illustrations confirm the foregoing. For further absorbing details of proof see the Biblical research magazine </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> July 1, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hence it is established that Moses compiled the material for Genesis, down to chapter 37, verse 2, from eleven previously written documents. The first two were written by the first man, Adam, as the material was revealed to him by God or as he experienced it.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Flying Opossum</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">The next glider of nature to pass before our searchlight of investigation is the flying pbalanger, or opossum. Like hi a associate u viators in tho field of soaring, the flying opossum is nocturnal and scurries about at night climbing and gliding from tree to tree by means of a ‘flying membrane, extending from wrist, to ankle in some species and from elbow to knee in others. Erinn ent representatives of this glider group are the greater, lesser and tbe pigmy. Of the three the greater flying opossum is by far the best glider, volplaning 80</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">while the greeter and lesser flying phalangers are devout vegetarians with soft, bushy tails, their niouse-eised relative, the pigmy, is insectivorous and has a scaly tail*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Like other marsupial^ the flying opossum produces many young at a tune, which are housed in a pouch across the mother's stomach and later on the parental back. Because of thia unusual rearing the manner in which the young are brought forth has been a source of debate among laymen. An eye witrees account reveals that after conception the embryos remain in the female's body about 12 days and are born at a very immature stage of development. Each of the young (from eight to as many as twonty-one)is no longer than a honey lice, but possesses strongly developed front legs. These powerful Little legs are put to good use as the habies damber through Mama's fur into her pouch* Once within the marsupium, each one swallows one of the teats &lt;&gt;r nippies so firmly that it is almost impossible to detach them. Occasionally more young are produced than there are teats, and only those for tunate enough to locate a mammary gland survive. After about seventy days in the pouch the youngsters make their exit and clasp to the hair on the mother's back and sometimes her tail. There they remain, hanging on for dear life as she gaily soars hither and yon, until the day they make their solo.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Flying Dragons, Snakes, Frogs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">Flying dragon! No need to conjure up visions of mammoth monsters spitting fire, for the flying dragon of Java is only a small, harmless lizard about six or eight inches in length. Like other gliders of naturedom, the flying lizard or dragon is equipped with &quot;wings&quot; formed by five or six elongated movable ribs which are connected hy loose folds of skin. When a glide is executed the membranes spread like fans, enabling the lizard to soar distances up to twenty yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When folded up the visible portions of the flying dragon are dull shades of brown and gray and blend with surrounding branches. However, when in flight brilliant reds, oranges and blues with black trimming* are revealed. Inf act, this little glider is sometimes confused with butterflies. At the end of a flight the transition from conspicuous gay colors to unobtrusive shades harmonizing with the background ia 90 abrupt and deceptive to the untrained eye that the reptile performs a most convincing Cinderella act; it seems to literally disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then there is the unusual but harmless flying snake of India, decorated with a yellow, four-petaled, red-centered flower design along its back. But even more remarkable than its coloring is the faculty which has given it its name—an ability to glide to a limited extent. When frightened it will fling itself into the air, am] by holding its body rigid a gentle descent to earth is effected. The flying snake has no special mechanism or &quot;wings” as other gliders of nature. Rather, he simply pushes his ribs outward to the fullest extent and draws in his belly, thus producing a large ronexve surface which checks the fall and converts it into a rapid glide. When in flight he resembles a piece of split bamboo or cane. The flying snake is a constrictor, and birds, lizards and rodents occupy top priority on his menu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Frogs, too, have taken up gliding. At least, over forty species of flying frogs have dune so. By spreading the membranes between their long toes, the airminded frogs arc able to glide through space for astounding distances. To learn how well these unusual aviators could glide, one was dropped from a high water tower. He plummeted downward about twelve fuel and then pulled his “ripcord'' and soared slowly earthward, landing uninjured about ninety feet from the base of the tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While the female flying frog is laying her eggs, an act which does not take place in the waler but at some location near its edge, she paddles the soft mass with her hind legs. The frothy mass soon hardens, forming a meringuelike crust. Inside this “nest&quot; the eggs develop. But as they do so, the jelly inside liquifies and slowly dissolves the outer crust, thus re leasing the anxious tadpoles to the outer world.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Gliders of the Sea</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">Ski mining thn surface of the sea like skipping stones are the flying fish, another group of nature’s gliders. Flying fish are essentially tropical and roam in large schools north tn Florida, and on the Pacific side, north to the Santa Barbara Islands. Some hardy specimens are ovhji found in Newfoundland. Controversy over whether the flying fish flies by flapping its pectoral fine or glides by using its fins as elevators and stabilizers as in airplanes has waxed hot from time to time. Most authorities now agree, however, that the illusion of wing-flapping in due to rapid rolling from side to side while in flight and that the fish simply glides like a soaring, motorless plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The power for the glide is furnished by a lower lobe of thp tail which oscillates to give the necessary ''push&quot; for the take off. Through the air the fish sorts, sometimes from 200 to 400 yards, depending on the breeze. As he begins to lose altitude and sinks and touches the surface of the water he will frequently lash out with a powerful swish of his tail and take off anew, witbout letting his body become immersed. A speed of ton yards per second was observed in one instance. His maximum rate of speed is probably twenty yards per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Leaping out of the water when disturbed by an approaching vessel, flying fish resemble big dragonflies or “squadrons of diminutive aeroplanes&quot;. Little does the euritius onlooker realize that the queer antics of this “high flying&quot; aquatic creature are a matter of self-preservation when the yawning, tooth-studded jaws of a hungry barracuda threaten. The tasty flying fish is also ravenously pursued by leaping tunas, sailfish, swordfish, marlins, dolphins, porpoises and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">man,</span><span class="font16"> Yes, our seaworthy glider is considered good eating by humans, although not extensively so used because of the difficulty encountered in catching it. Most of those eaten are taken accidently as they land aboard ships at sea rather than in their nntivH element. Occasionally they are induced to fly aboard a craft at night by the display of a lighted lantern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So perfectly constructed mt modern aerodynamic principles are flying fish that Dr. C. M. Breder, Jr., authority on this sea glider, shows that pioneers of airplane design would have progreRHed more rapidly by imitating the fish rather than JiTiy bird used as a model since tho days of da Vinci. Modern planes resemble most nearly the anatomical features of the flying fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And in the final analysis, whether on laud, in the air, or on the sea, each one of nature’s gliders plays its role in adding to the endloss variety of Jehovah God’s wondrous creation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Marriage or Singleness, Which?</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">I</span><span class="font16">N THESE days the matter of staying single </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font16"> of marrying poses a problem for a person of the world. It is particularly so for u person that has given himself tn the Lord God in full consecration through Jesus Christ. The ^rsdii of the world may hesitate over the matter because of the general economic conditions and the question of finding<sup>1</sup> a mate that is clean and that will prove cofiipanicui-able, faithful and true amid the lowering moral condition of mankind, and also the possibility of a third world war inside a generation's time, when his children would be of age and subject to military conarripl-io/L</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The true Christian, however, with the Bible viewpoint of matters studies the subject, not only with the above consideration in mind, but also with the question in mind of carrying out his consecration and obligatory service to God. For such one the matter becomes doubly serious, because we have reached the consummation or “time of the end” of this old world and. the prophecy inust now be carried into fulfillment by Christians, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto hll nations.” (Matthew 24:14) No Christian can afford to miss sharing therein. So as not to hamstring himself in his efforts to do the witness work, the Christian studies over the subject of marriage, before he marries in ha^te to repent in leisure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The apostle Paul gave good advice on this subject, at 1 Corinthians chapter 7. He did not forbid marriage', and most positively he did not lay any fonndatjon</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">S3, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">for the religious instituting of monasteries and convents of monks and nuns and of a priestly hierarchy all under the reqniretnenl. tn stay unmarried. To the contrary, Paul wrote: “Tn the latter timed some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(tn bidding to marry&quot; </span><span class="font16">(1 Timothy 4:1,3) Nevertheless, Paul does set forth good reasons for not getting nmrrind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among those reasons is I hat those who give np their virginity or singleness will Imve the outward troubles of married life, “tribulations &lt;if the flesh,” and he would like to have the single ones to be spared that. In the ordinary course of married life the couple marrying have taken on a burden in each other and it may lead to further responsibilities in I he way of children. Unavoidably, troubles are due to come amid this present distressed condition of the world and because of human imperfections, faults and unwisdom. Hence let those in the single state be cautioned beforehand that, although they may not sin,by now getting married, they will be putting themselves in the way of new troubles, which they must bear while fulfilling their obligations in God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Christian should not give his whole or chief attention to personal selfish matters which have to do with the flesh or human body, whether these be enjoying a wife or husband, or be one’s own joys or sorrows, or commercial activities or necessary dealings with this world. The Christian should not bury or sink himself too deeply in these things to the neglect of what is eternal; because</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">this world and its scheme or fashion of things are due to pass off the stage of this earth. As against becoming overcharged with the swiftly passing selfish things of this present world, one should lay ii£» treasures in heaven. No other person or thing or activity should be allowed to engross the Christian's time and attention to the point of interfering with Kingdom service. Instead of an overload of the cares of this life in this old world, he should try to relieve himself of such cares as far as possible or avoid them. Then he can concern himself more folly with the things of God's kingdom, which kingdom must now be advertised to all Ilie nations as a witness to them. Specially is this so now, in (hese last days. All this is the gist of the following instruction given through Paul:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“The opportunity [or seasonable time] is contracted for what rcmaincth—in order l.hat they who have wives may be as though they had none, and I hey who weep us though they wept not, and they who rejoice as though they rejoiced not, and they who buy as though they possessed not, and they who use the world as though they used it not to the full,— for Uie fashion of this world passeth away; and I desire you t&lt;i be without anxiety/’—1 Corinthians 7: 29-32, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham; Am. Stan, Ver.,</span><span class="font16"> margin; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Young,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There are anxious cares attached to living in thia world. Ln showing the comparative freedom that the unmarried Christian may enjoy from sneh cares and how the interests of the married Christiana necessarily are divided between the fleshly and the spiritual, Paul continues on: &quot;And I desire you to be without anxiety :—The unmarried man id anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he that </span><a href="http://ttai.li"><span class="font16">hath </span></a><span class="font16">married is anxious for the things of the world, how he may please his wife—and ho is divided; anil I he unmarried woman or the virgin is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit; but she that hath married is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. This, however, with a view to your own profit am I saying,—not that a snare upon you I may cast, but with a view to what is comely and devoted unto the Lord without distraction.” —1 Corinthians 7: 32-35, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Mwrlum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The married person, as Paul already explained, does not have the full authority over hia body, for his mate is one flesh with him and has, therefore, some claim upon his body. Seeing this, Paul correctly states that the unmarried Christian is more fully set apart and reserved for Qod<sup>T</sup>s direct service, both in body and in spirit. The spirit, or mental inclination, of such single Christian urges him into service. So, having no spouse claiming part control of his body, he can follow the spirit or inclination' of his mind and heart. Likely being a widower, Paul knew whereof he spoke and was competent to give trustworthy advice. (1 Corinthians 7:8) His advice so pleased the Lord that the Lord saw good to preserve it in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not referring to any so-called 'spirit ual bride” nor to a father’s giving or withholding his daughter as regards marriage, hut speaking about the virginity of a single Christian, whether mule or female, Paul next says: &quot;He that standeth in his heart steadfast, having no necessity, but hath authority concerning his own will, and this hath determined in his iwn heart, to preserve his own virginity, well shall he do. So that he that give th in marriage his own virginity<sup>1</sup>' doeth well; and he that giveth it not shall do better?’—1 Corinthians 7:36-38, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham;</span><span class="font16"> also </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, for Christians in this postwar world and with the battle of Armageddon in the offing, it is a choice of taking a good course by getting married to a like consecrated servant of Jehovah God or doing better by staying single, by not getting married but keeping his virgin state with all its vital strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Approximately thirty shiploads are </span><span class="font16">sent out of Mackenzie each month- However, the 10,000-ton vessels must carry only half loads until they cross the bar at Georgetown on the Domerara's mouth. To remedy this, small boats shuttle additional bauxite out to points in the Virgin Islands where the larger vessels stop and complete their cargoes.

If it is decided that the ore can bp mined economically, the area is denuded of all vegetation, raked bald of every stump, trunk and branch. If the overburden is entirely of sand it is forced off by powerful jets of waler, a method caJJed &quot;hydraulic stripping”. Finally the ore lies hare in surrender before the invaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Next, a hattvry of jackhammers perforates the bed with 24-foot hales, and in their wake a crew of powder men plug these with dynamite. A light blast loosens the bauxite and a Diesel shovel is “walked” to the spot to take up its task of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">loading the ore</span><span class="font16"> into small railroad cars. About 40,000 tons of bauxite are railroaded to the mill in a 24-hour period.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Through the Mill</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">At the mill the rough, porous, reddish-streaked rock is crushed if too large, then washed and dried. This process consists of bathing it beneath a row of noz-</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">zles pumping</span><span class="font16"> water and next turning it over to the “scrubbers” where it is rolled and shaken. This all hut eliminates any silica content present. Afterward it must he dried, and drying bauxite is no child's play. The ore is dumped into long, brick-lined kilns approximately ten feet in diameter and extending more than fifty feet, sloping downward to the kiln hood, from which a very hot flame is shot at least twenty fee up this tube. Five of the kilns rotate slowly, two of them more slowly than others. These Iwo contain hotter fires, the temperature inside reaching 1,41)0 degrees Fahrenheit “This is the 'calcining’ process,” the onlooker is told as he sweats it out.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Finished Products</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">The calcined bauxite is stored. Later it will come out of retirement to fulfill its destiny in abrasives such ns emery wheels, grinding stones and refractory bricks. The remainder of the ore is prepared for a more glamorous existence. From storage it is transported to the tall ship-loader and, amid an extravagant farewell mushroom of gray dust, is plunged into the ship's hold. The bauxite’s course in reducing at the mill has shushed one half t)f its weight away, leaving the ore now in smaller, more uniform chunks, The vessel plies down the river and soon disappears on the horizon, pointing seaward for its destination, Port Alfred, Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There the bauxite will perish, but not before bringing forth its fabulous heir, aluminum. This light, durable metal is, in ever-increasing ways, contributing to more convenient living on land and sea and in air in virtually every nation and city of the earth. It is helping to provide more possibilities for our modern, inebdlic machine age. lint what will be possible when all mankind in a new world fully comprehends the resources of bis global home!</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Chinese Dilemma</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; The U. 8. Department of State and the IJ. N. were on the horns of a dilemma os tn the question of recognizing Communist China. The de facto government of China was that of the Communists, with the Nationalists clinging precariously to a de jure status and the piece of Chinese territory known as Formosa. Sonu? American “statesmen'’ said ill-advised things about ni-cnpying Formosa, but such a scheme was generally reject cd at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain meanwhile took time by the forelock and the hull by the horns, granting Communist China not merely de facto but de jure recognition. Formal notice was sent to Chiang Kai-shek’s government of the step taken. As far as the “consent of the governed” was concerned, nothing was said about that, but the Chinese people seemed tn be r on sent-ing without much ado to having the Communists take river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Peking government further complicated matters by taking possession of American, French and Dutch consular properties. In retaliation U. S. Secretary of State Acheson ordered all remaining American diplomats .out of China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">In the U* N. Security Council the Russian representative, Jacob A. Malik, objected tn con tinned recognition and seating of Nationalist China's representative, Dr. T. F. Tsiutig, walking nut</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(1/10) when the protest went unheeded. He reappeared at the Council two dayg In ter and again demanded the ousting of Dr. Tsiang, saying that this was “the will and decision of the people of China”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; M. Roger Garreau, French U. N. delegate and president of the Trusteoshi p Council, in early January disclosed a plan for Jerusalem which provided for internationalization of part of both the old city and the new, taking in the “holy places” aad the Jewish wailing wall. The plan also seeks neutralization of bnth the Jewish and Arab areas. Israeli spokesmen indicated they would not accept the plan. Significance was attached to Garreau’s consultations with Cardinal Spellman as an indication of the Vatican's willingness to compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Spaak at Philadelphia</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; Speaking at a meeting of the University of Pennsylvania (1/14), Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium said the U. N. “will not survive, in the long run, the absurd rule which grants the right of absolute veto to the five great powers”. Better and fairer than the veto, lit? said, would be :± system under which ench nation wvuld have a number of votes In the General Assembly in proportion to its territorial a lid economic importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; The U.S. in early January called on Hungary to close down its consulates in New York and] Cleveland by the 15th. The action was obviously in retaliation for the long detention, incommunbi cado, of Robt. A. Vogeler, assistant vice-president of an American firm nationalized by the Hungarian government. Vogeler is charged with sabotage and espionage.</span></p>

This program im-ludes shipment of military supplies, under certain conditions, to aid Yugoslavia in case of attack ,by llnssla or any of its satellites. Yugoslavia meanwhile was considering placing a ban on Hights of Soviet and satellite planes over its territory.</span></p>

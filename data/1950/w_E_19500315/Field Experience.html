<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Many years ago a young woman who was born in Germany and who was a devout Protestant and a student of the Bible believed she could serve the poor and needy better if she were to embrace the Roman Catholic belief and become a nun. This she did. She took the veil in the order of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, of which ‘Mother’ Cabrini was the mother general. This sister became the traveling companion of Cabrini and was later elevated to the position of a mother superior. Her duties took her to Rome and Vatican City, and one day while in the Vatican with Cabrini she noted some magnificent paintings upon the wall, one of which was a picture of Dante’s Inferno. She saw the poor victims portrayed as in frightful torments. Shortly she met a cardinal with whom she spoke in German, saying: ‘If I believed Almighty God was doing that (pointing to the picture) to the poor unfortunates just because they were not Catholics, I’d lose all my faith in God.’ The cardinal smiled and said: ‘My child, don’t take it too seriously. We have to frighten the people to make them good.’ The sister never forgot that. She came to America and she and her secretary, another nun, opened a home for orphans just outside of New York city. She was crying for God to show her the truth. She bought a small radio and began to tune in various religious programs. One day she tuned in WBBR, listened, and a great flood of light came into her heart and mind. She had found the truth! She sent for literature and began to witness to her neighbors in her nun’s garb. Her secretary also got the truth and began to witness. It was not long before off came the garments of ritualistic religion and on went the garments of praise to the great Jehovah!”—Watchtower radio station WBBR.</p>

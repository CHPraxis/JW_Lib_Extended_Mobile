<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Shortly before he was impaled Jesus counseled his apostles, “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” The time for the accomplished end of this wicked system of things is very near, and the servants of God are giving the final witness in every corner of the earth. What a privilege it is to have a share in this momentous work! Since you have now learned something of God’s gracious provisions for those who act in harmony with his will, wouldn’t you like to share in spreading this good news? For January Jehovah’s witnesses have as their service theme, Sharing in the Final Witness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>). During this month they will offer a year’s subscription for this Christian journal, <em>The Watchtower, </em>on a contribution of $1.00. Why not share in the final witness by calling the attention of your neighbors to the significance of the times in which we live and offer them a subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>to aid them further to learn of God’s requirements? The local company of Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to assist you; or write to us and we will furnish you with additional instructions and forms for reporting your activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>1951 YEARBOOK OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of the increase of God’s government and peace there will be no end. This Scriptural truth is convincingly proved by the report of the 1950 service year as presented by the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society in the 1951 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em>. In addition to this annual report covering more than 100 regions, the Yearbook contains the president’s comment on the yeartext for 1951 and a daily text and comment for each day of the coming year. Those associated with a group should send in combined orders, as through the servant of a company, to save time and expense. A remittance of 50c per copy should accompany each order. Your 1951 Calendar may be ordered at the same time; price: 25 cents each or five to one address for $1.00.</p>

If you are traveling toward New York on U. S. Route 22, near Plainfield you will notice a large sign saying “Turn Right to Dunellen”. Make the right turn and drive through Dunellen to the camp. If you are traveling toward New York on U. S. Route 1, just after you leave New Brunswick turn left at the sign that says “To Camp Kilmer”. After you leave the main highways you will see “J.W. Camp” signs to guide you to the camp.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If you did not receive through your company of Jehovah’s witnesses the special form for requesting camp parking space, you may write to the Watchtower Convention Rooming Committee, 557 West 157th Street, New York 32, N. Y., and request the form. Please use the form when requesting parking space. There will be a small charge to those using this rented land.</p>

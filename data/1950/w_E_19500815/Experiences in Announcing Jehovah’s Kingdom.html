<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“SHEEP” IN FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Brother Bernard Gaouranga, one of the new and zealous publishers of the Bangui company, came to visit here at Dekoa for two months. It is his native land. We go out witnessing together, and, as this district is, so to speak, solidly people of good will, we are followed by big crowds to whom we witness. Protestant assemblies, encouraged principally by Jacques Samba, a native pastor of that region, invite us constantly, in spite of the interdiction of the European pastors. In one place it happened that we were preaching to an assembly of 988 eager listeners. Many more persons of good will hesitate to participate in the “strange work” of Jehovah because they have not seen in our land a white leader in charge of the work. The colored Africans would not hurl themselves to an organization without fear unless they see a European in charge. Therefore we rejoiced so much in reading in one of the issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>that the Society will send some brethren.—Dekoa publisher.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A publisher from Florida reports this rather amusing experience: “One outstanding event was with a man who had lost two dollars ten years ago in his home, and had fired his maid for theft. When he asked me whether his Bible was like mine and contained the same information, I asked to see his copy. After some searching it was found, and I opened his Bible and there the long-lost two dollars. He spent one of the dollars for an <em>Awake! </em>subscription, and commented, ‘If I ever find the maid I’ll send her a subscription with the other one.’”</p>

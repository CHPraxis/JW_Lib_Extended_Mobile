“STICK TO YOUR WORK”
For the month of September, Jehovah’s witnesses have selected their service theme from 1 Timothy 4:16, Moffatt, “Stick to your work.” Their sticking to the work of gospel-preaching has enabled you and thousands of others to better understand God’s purposes. Are you not grateful for their perseverance? Your appreciation can best be shown by calling these truths to the attention of others. So doing, you, too, share in a work that leads both the workers and those who hear them onto the path of life. To this end, three booklets, one colored-cover and two self-covered, are to be offered during September, on a contribution of 10c. If you would like to obtain a supply to furnish to your acquaintances you may obtain some from the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses or write to us for them. We shall be pleased at the same time to furnish report slips and such instructions as you require so that your share in the preaching work may be added to that of the thousands of others who are sticking to this work of the ministry throughout the world.
“REPORT OF INTERNATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES”
A complete report describing all eight days of the International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, held July 30 through August 6, 1950, at the Yankee Stadium, New York, will be available about August 14, 1950. This 96-page brochure, which includes all five convention issues, is printed on white paper with pages the same in dimensions as this magazine. It is bound in a durable cover and will be mailed anywhere, postpaid, on a contribution of 25c. It provides a lasting record of this memorable event.

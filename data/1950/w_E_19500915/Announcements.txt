“IT IS NEARER THAN THEY THINK” TESTIMONY PERIOD
The month of October has been designated “It Is Nearer than You Think” Testimony Period. Do you believe, as do the majority of the readers of The Watchtower, that the final end of all wickedness is very near at hand, much nearer than the uninformed think? If you do, you will undoubtedly desire to join with us in the activity to which this October Testimony Period is to be devoted, namely, the taking of subscriptions for the Awake! magazine. Awake! the companion magazine to The Watchtower, is issued on the 8th and 22nd of every month. It plays a very important part in awakening the people to the nearness of the expression of God’s wrath at Armageddon. You will want your friends and neighbors to have the timely information it presents, and you can aid them by offering a year’s subscription for Awake! at the regular rate of one dollar. We shall be pleased to send you instructions and also helpful forms on which to report your activity as well as to secure the essential information so that the subscriptions you obtain will be correctly addressed.

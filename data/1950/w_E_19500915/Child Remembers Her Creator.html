<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Each day in a large west coast city a medical doctor picks up five school children, gives them a little party and then interviews them over a national radio network for about eight or nine minutes. On this day a group of about seven or eight years of age were being interviewed, and among the questions he asked them was, “What do you want to do when you grow up?” One little girl was heard to answer: “Be a missionary with Jehovah’s witnesses.” The doctor replied, “I am sure you will be a fine missionary.”—B.

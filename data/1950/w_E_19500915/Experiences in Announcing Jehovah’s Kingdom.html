<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Priest vs. Christ</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a discussion at the door by a minister of the gospel with the householder, the mention of Jehovah’s name called forth a priest who had been within listening. “I see your Jehovah has you pretty well posted, but those names like Moses, Isaiah, and others you continually quote mean nothing to me. If I want to know anything I can write to the pope or even telephone him for information.” After a few more of such observations the minister of the gospel replied, “You talk like the men Jesus spoke of in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:1-40:23:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">the 23rd chapter of Matthew</a>.” “God damn <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:1-40:23:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the 23rd chapter of Matthew</a>,” was the priest’s reply.—M.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In working over our territory we found a group known as the “Church of God and Christ”. The first one we contacted was the clergyman. He received the message very favorably and invited us to return. In the meantime he told his congregation that he was going to take lessons so that he could the better preach to them and asked for them to pay for these lessons. They readily agreed. Seems that this preacher could not conceive of anything being free. As our work progressed in the territory we got to visit each of his members. They too received the message favorably and were glad to take part in a regular study. As a result the church has closed its doors and all its one-time members are now taking part in proclaiming Jehovah’s kingdom. The preacher is still studying but has not taken an active part as yet.—A. H., Alabama.</p>

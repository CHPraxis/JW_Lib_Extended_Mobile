<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The prophet Zechariah declared: “In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zec 8:23</a>) “Those days” have come for Italy as well as for all other nations, peoples and languages of the earth, and it is a daily source of amazement to see spontaneous fulfillments of this prophecy in this land. Here is a case in point.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The company servant of the B——— company of Jehovah’s witnesses in northern Italy recently received two unexpected visitors who, explaining that they had come as representatives of a number of villages six to eight miles away, lost no time in announcing the purpose of their visit: “We want to be Christians! We have heard that we might find Protestants here that preach a good doctrine. We have recognized ourselves as being deceived by the priest and have turned from him, desiring now to be organized into a church. Among us are over 120 families; can you help us?” Overwhelmed with genuine joy, the company servant immediately informed them that a traveling representative of the Society, the circuit servant, was due that week and that he would be glad to visit and talk with these interested families.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As promised, the matter was talked over with the circuit servant, plans were made for a public discourse, police authorization secured, and all was in order for Monday evening. That night as the brethren approached the village, they rejoiced to see groups of three and four walking toward the hall to attend the “new church”, as it was called by them. Outside the hall a crowd had gathered, an unusual light because in Italy it generally happens that the audience does not begin arriving until the discourse is well under way. But why were they standing outside? To give the “preacher” a royal welcome? No indeed! They were outside because there was no more room inside: the hall with two adjacent rooms was packed tight with expectant people, and the arriving brethren felt at that moment the compassion Jesus must have experienced in his day upon seeing the multitudes in need of a shepherd.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But Satan was determined to nip the “new church” in the bud. Five <em>carabinieri, </em>awaiting the circuit servant’s arrival, immediately informed him that permission to hold the meeting had been canceled! It was useless discussing the matter with these police. The marshal’s office was three miles away. Appealing to the assembled audience to remain, for he had many important things to tell them, the circuit servant hastened to the police station and, with the Italian Constitution in one hand and the Questura’s written authorization in the other, succeeded in convincing the authorities that the meeting should be allowed. The latter acquiesced on one condition: no wine was to be sold and all glasses and bottles were to be cleaned from the hall. Condition granted, for the speaker was to use the bar as his “pulpit”!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The discourse was given, lasting one and a half hours, before a most attentive and responsive audience imaginable. No one entered or left. When statements of the Church’s hatred for the spread of the Bible were read, and official Catholic Church documents revealing the pagan origin of its doctrines, expressions of surprise appeared on honest faces as they began to perceive why the Church has hidden the Bible from the Catholic people. An accurate count was impossible, but over 1,000 persons listened to the talk, and not a single handbill had been used to invite them! The limited supply of 185 booklets, 18 books and 30 magazines were placed in eager hands in short order.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Many were the interesting comments after the discourse was finished. The wife of the owner of the hall had been ill and earlier that same day had been visited by the parish priest, who had counseled her to go to the hospital. “Hospital!” cried she, “but I can’t. I’m expecting the new church tonight!” Remarked a young man: “I have heard many discourses of the clergy, the Communists and others, but never a discourse like this. With these I desire to unite myself.” Another: “I thought we had it, but now I must admit that you folks have it.” “It’s about time we were getting our eyes opened,” opined another man who asked to be visited and wanted to subscribe for <em>La Torre di Guardia.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That was indeed a memorable evening. As the brethren took leave of the townsfolk, the latter lined both sides of the street shouting farewell and “Return again”. This gave promise that the local company of Jehovah’s ministers will have many heart-rejoicing experiences in these days as they help these persons of good-will array themselves on Jehovah’s side along with other thousands in the earth who now cry out: “We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you!”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“LIVING UP TO THE NAME” TESTIMONY PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do you profess or would you like to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses? Then you sincerely want to walk worthy of the name. You will appreciate, too, the intent of the June Testimony Period, entitled “Living Up to the Name”. We are sure you will be with us in carrying out the program of activity for this month. Toward delivering the witness in harmony with our God-given name, we are offering the three bound books <em>“Let God Be True”, “The Kingdom Is at Hand” </em>and <em>“The Truth Shall Make You Free”, </em>on the nominal contribution of one dollar for all three books. It is mutually strengthening to have your cooperation in this testimony, and our joined efforts work together to give a more impressive witness and to prove that the Most High God has a people on earth who uphold the honor of his name. He knows all the efforts you put forth, not for praise from man but from him. Nevertheless, we should appreciate your making out a report of the month’s work and results, on our form therefor, that we may compile a combined report.</p>

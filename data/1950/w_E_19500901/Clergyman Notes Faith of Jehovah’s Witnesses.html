<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of Jehovah’s witnesses preaching from door to door in Arkansas met a householder who said, “I wish all you Jehovah’s witnesses could have heard our pastor yesterday. He gave a wonderful sermon on faith.” Then this person quoted the clergyman as saying: “I don’t know how you feel about it, but in my estimation there is only one organization on this earth that really has faith in what they believe, and that is the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. Would you [pointing to congregation] have the faith and courage to stand on the street corner and put forth your views and be laughed at, scorned, mocked, arrested, beaten and put in prison and still continue to do it? Would you have the faith and courage to stand there in the snow, rain and heat and not become discouraged? Would you have the faith and courage to ring door bell after door bell and receive in return doors slammed in your face and still continue in your belief? I don’t believe you can say that you have that kind of faith. If our church had the kind of faith that this group of Jehovah’s witnesses have, we’d have a tremendous organization.”</p>

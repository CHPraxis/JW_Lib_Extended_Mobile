<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It was very joyful at Kawaihae last Friday to find at least three isolated publishers in this beach town. One family said they were immersed about ten years ago by an early brother in the territory. One of them had seen us at the Chinese store and later stopped us on the road to contact us. It seems that no one had called here for over three years, and the religionists had tried to get them to burn their books, but they refused and plainly told them why. One family lost their home in the tidal wave of April, 1946, and they lost everything except the <em>Salvation </em>book. Now they would like to get some of these older books again. They took copies of the publications which we had with us at the time and subscribed for the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. The <em>Awake! </em>magazine and <em>Equipped </em>book were entirely new to them, and they were overjoyed when we told them of the many things that had happened since someone called there last. They didn’t know about the Gilead school and the conventions. We arranged to call there again in two weeks and hold a study in the book <em>“Let God Be True” </em>and help them to get organized for the Kingdom service. There are many isolated places on this large island of Hawaii, and, by the Lord’s grace, we hope to be able to reach them soon.—Special pioneer.</p>

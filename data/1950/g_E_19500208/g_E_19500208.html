<p><span class="font3">IN THE NAME OF TOLERANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Much is said today about tolerance. Not the tolerance that allows free expression of differing opinion, but a tolerance that silently endures contradictory opinion. But this silent tolerance la deemed essential only in religious matters. Much is said about brotherhood, but always relative to religions. There are no Brotherhood Weeks for politicians, or financiers, or militarists. Tolerance to them does not mean silent endurance of clashing opinion. They plunge Into sarcastic word battles and fiery cold wars, loose their verbal broadsides in tempestuous rough-arid 'tumble that truth may triumph over error. But the modern view Is that Bible matters must not be so threshed out in the open forum of public discussion. In the Bible realm free speech beepmea intolerance; retigioip error becomes unassailable; blunt or sarcastic words horrify. But in the field of the Bible, what better authority than the Bible? This article looks Into the Scriptures to see whether plain and even sarcastic speech stands or falls before the divine standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">fiCTjROTHERHOOD is not only a gen-</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">D erous impulse but also a divine command. Others may he moved into brotherhood only by sentiment. We acknowledge brotherhood as a religious duty. All the faiths represented here claim as a common heritage the great thoughts of, the Hebrew prophets. The prophets were among the first of men who saw that the concept of the fatherhood of God required men to do justice to one another/<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font19">So said President Truman to the National Conference of Christians and Jews when pledging support .of their Brotherhood Week. His words raise questions. Is brotherhood among differing church groups a divine command and a religious duty? Was that outstanding Hebrew prophet Moses saying so when he warned concerning other religions: “Neither ©halt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 8, 1930</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">after their gods’’? (Deuteronomy 7:16; Exodus 34:13,15) And was Christ the Son of God admitting brotherhood with the Pharisees when He labeled them sons of Satan?—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Realize that the way of Christian integrity does not tread the path of compromise, Jesus advocated no interfaith movement to'consolidate scribe, Pharisee, Sadducee and Christian. Rather than such a merger, Jesus told Christians: &quot;Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind; both shall fall into the ditch/<sup>7 </sup>(Matthew 15:14) When the mentally blind had their eyes opened they abandoned their former bedarkened sects. They tried no foolish uniting of Christianity with the doctrine of Pharisee and Sadducee, for that religious leaven would have contaminated pure Christianity, (Matthew 16: 6,12; Galatians 5: 9) Neither Jesus nor His disciples tolerated unequal yoking of believer and infidel, righteousness and unrighteousness, light and darkness, Christ and Belial, God’s temple and idols. Not inter faith but sep-</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">aratenegB, they demanded.—2 Corinthians 6:14-18, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nor did faithful men before Christ champion interfaith. “Can two walk together, except they be agreed t' (Amos 3:3) When the Israelites entered Cana aula nd they were not instructed to launch Brotherhood Weeks to promote haratay between themselves and the false worshipers there. Such weak fraternizing was practiced later, but the price was prohibitive. On the subtle altar of religious peace they sacrificed integrity toward Jehovah. As the centuries rolled by their spineless backsliding gathered momentum, till finally it swept them to national disaster and Babylonian captivi</span><a href="http://interfail.il"><span class="font17">ty. But fai</span></a><span class="font17">thful men sidestepped the Bly interfaith snares and weak brotherhood compromises. They counted the cost of religious peace, and when it added up li&gt; their integrity toward God they balked at the price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Tolerance </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for What?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Today most religionists readily pay over integrity to Scriptural principle </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fdr</span><span class="font17"> outward harmony between sects and cults. Popular belief once held that the many separate religions were merely different roads leading to heaven, but now modern religious engineers want to cement together into a manydaned highway these different religions roads. They yearn fuf one world church. Realizing that this means drawing together a conglomeration of ritual and doetrinu that clashes and repels and pushes apart, they cry out for tolerance, hail tolerance as the glue needed to cement info one the diverse sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Tolerance for what! Why, tolerance for error. For a Christian to enter the inter faith fold, would mean be must tolerate pagan teachings under a Christian label, tolerate the tenet of a Ihree-in-one God, tolerate claims that God fiendishly tortures souls in fiery lakes, tolerate the hlaaphdiny that for money God will release suffering souls from a flaming pur-gnfnry, tolerate bingo gambling, tolerate the view that Jesus was not Messiah but an impostor, tolerate clerical hypocrisy and political meddling, tolerate religious warmongering, and chaplain-blessing of Christian killing Christian, and on and on would flow the endless stream of blasphemies against God that the Christian would have to tolerate in silence. He would have to wink at sin, shut eyes to wnmg, plug ears to blasphemy, make his tongue dumb to silenlly tolerate evit Fearing to offend by word or deed, tolerating in the name of tolerance every satanic snare, he would convert to an unresisting worm squirming its pay through a useless existence till eternally dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This sly, subtie, modern doctrine of tolerance that snakes, its devious way through the land is not true tolerance, but is actually intolerance in devilish disguise. In the name of tolerance hipii have become intolerant of exposure of religious evildoers, intolerant of unadulterated Bible truth that makes men free, intolerant of gospel-preaching that re-</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">leaws prisoners from false religions and </span><span class="font17">sets them moving on the n»id hj life. The modern tolerance-cult gives new meaning to the word tolerance. To them it doos not mean tnleratijig expression </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font17">opinion different from theirs; to them it means tolerating differences that must never be vigorously debated. To challenge is to stir up hate, they say. This they cannot tolerate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Actually, the tolerance-howlers are not tolerant in matters on which they feel strongly. For example, do they tolerate in silence policies political* commercial, social and military that they oppose! Would there be such a hot cqld war if they did ? Silent toleration of error seems to apply only to the religious realm. Why? The reason so many can grandly say we should mumly tolerate religious differences is that they consider religion of little practical consequence. So they argue, Why highlight differences and create frictions, why not live and let live T With their nearsighted and materialistic vision they gee not God in the picture, fail to see the need of letting truth triumph over error through public discussion, of letting Bible truth be preached oven though it divide father, mother, son, daughter. (Luke 12:51-53) They prefer blasphemy against God to error exposure that shocks vulnerable religious susceptibilities, because they appreciate not that &quot;God must prove true, though every man be false’<sup>7</sup>. (Romans 3:4, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font17"> Better that mankind be divided and some right than united and all wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Proper to </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Use Sarcasm?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the name of tolerance some legislators would become intolerant of freedom of speech and worship. They would frame mischief by law. (Psalm 94:20) Last year a bill was introduced in an Australian state assembly to prevent “blasphemous writings likely to incite abbot'r^niT* again st any religion or any religious denomination or sect”. One of the published purposes of the bill was to halt &quot;the insulting and abusive slanders on all forms of organized religion in the journals of such bodies as the Communist party and the witnesses of Jehovah”. Any prosecuted would have the burden of proving their literature not guilty; it would be considered guilty till proved innocent. Again, a bill introduced in the California state legislature sought to make it unlawful for anyone to distribute or prepare &quot;any propaganda designed to belittle, ridicule, upbraid, condemn or Sold up to scorn and contempt any religious system or denomination&quot; More than ten years ago the United States Supreme Court declared such gag laws unconstitutional.—310 U.S, 296.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Occasionally a reader of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> will make a similar protest against the use of sarcasm. One recently objected; “Is the sarcasm necessary, that appears so consistently in the main articles of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!!</span><span class="font17"> Ca^’t we have straight report-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">ing for a change, and leave sarcasm to the world and its writers 1 Tact should be our Theocratic weapon. Why isn’t tact being used in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?’</span><span class="font17"> Undoubtedly these questions are asked in sincerity, and deserve resjiectful answering.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>/« Sarcasm Theocratic?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">First, there is a proper hhtred, Jehovah. hates liars and evildoers. (Psalm 5:5,6; Proverbs 6:16-19) Christ shares that hatred. (Hebrews 1:8, tf) All Christians can say Aruen to David's words: “Do I not hate them that hate thee, 0 Lord! And do I not loathe them who oppose theeT With the deadliest hatred, I hate them.&quot; (Psalm 139: 21, 22, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.) Nor</span><span class="font17"> is that hatred suppressed or concealed hypocritically, but finds frequent and blunt expression in Gndi Word. Yes, it even finds outlet in cutting san asni and mocking ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Job called his three “religious friends&quot; “forgers of lies&quot; and “physicians of no value&quot;. (Job 13:4) Isaiah pulled no „ punches when he exposed religious shepherds supposed to wateh over God's floc* ,’ “JLIis watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dojfs, they cannot bark; sleeping [dreaming, or talking in tbeir sleep], lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough&quot; (Isaiah 56:10,11; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font17"> And what about Jerenduh’s slashing verbal barrage that castigated Israel's spiritual adultery vvitb demon gods by likening her to lust-maddened beast si—&quot;How dare you say, ‘I am not stained, I ha^e not sought the Baals' ! Look at your life in the Valley, think how you have carried on: you are a swift young camel, that doubles on ber tracks, a beifer running wild in the wold, heated with passion, snuffing the breeze, in the rutting season —who can control her! No male need trouble to search for her; all can find her at mating-lime.&quot;—Jeremiah 2:23,24, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Who will contend that Job and Isaiah and Jeremiah spoke in unruffled tones void of oral emphasis or feeling 1 Can any conceive such devastating condemnations parroted out of mouths minus the vocal inflections of scorn and disgust the words cry out fort Who can argue that this was no more than “plain speech&quot;? that this strong language was weakly uttered in placating or neutral voice! that the speakers' hearts were not in it! The heart represents the seat of motives an'd emotion*. and we can he euro an abundance of righteous indignation welled up in those three hearts to make those three mouths pour out the words with all the feeling needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Out of the abundance of the heart the month spenketh/' said Jesus. (Matthew 12:34) Henee we can bp positive Ihal Jesus also allowed heartfelt feelings to merge with ideas from the mind so that both might find full expression in the words that came out of His mouth. He spoke with feeling when Jie referred to murderous, crafty Herod as “that fox”, and when He spoke of some as brutish swine before whom the pearls of truth should not be cast. (Matthew 7; 6; Luke 13: 32) Was He not ridiculing the hypocrites that presume to remove specks from the eyes of others while they have beams in their own? (Matthew 7:3-5) And now ridiculous Ho painted clergy that fussed over minor matters but flouted major duties! If you saw a finicky fellow strain a gnat out of his drink but leave in and swallow a camel, would you not hrand him a ridiculous fool! So Jesus called such clergymen fools and said: “Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel! Matthew 23:17, 23, 24, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And who is such a dullard that he can not sense the deep concern in Jesus* voice when He cries out: ‘ Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess. Woo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchresj which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell [Gehenna] !** (Matthew 23:25, 27, 33, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.;</span><span class="font17"> margin) Later He told the same class, “£e are of your father the devil.” (John 8:44) Peter referred to backsliders as dogs returning to their vomit and as washed sows returning to their miry* wallows.—2 Peter 2:22.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Unmistakable Mockery and Derision</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">If so the still say the foregoing is not sarcasm hid only blunt speech spiritlessly spoken, let them weign the following. Again give car to Job as he addressee his three “friends”: “No doubt you are the men who know ? Wisdom will die with you!” Did Job mean that! Hardly! Seconds later he told them: “Ask the very beasts, and they will leach you; ask the wild birds—they will tell you; crawling creatures will instruct you, fish in the sea will inform you? Not ho wise, if needing to go to crawling creatures to get gome sense. Those men thought they knew it all, thought all wisdom resided in their heads and would perish with them. That is what Job was telling them. Irony is used when a person says one thing and means just the opposite. Job’s words dripped sarcastic irony 1—Job 12: 2,7,8, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For an example of mockery open your Bible to Isaiah chapters 13 and 14 and read there the taunting song aimed at Babylon and its king. Also, note the taunting ring in the following: “The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women.&quot; (Jeremiah 51:30) On another occasion God’s then-holy city tossed her head and laughed in scorn at Assyrian king. Sennacherib because he stupidly blasphemed God: “She scorns you, she laughs at you, Sion the maiden, she tosses her head at you, Jerusalem the</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">maid. Whom have you insulted and bias* p he med, at whom have you dared raise your voices and Jift your eyes on high! —the' deity of Israel </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">I”—</span><span class="font19">2 Kings 19: 21, 22, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Wishy-washy Israel at one time trickled aimlessly along its religious course, weaving unsteadily between Jehovah's worship and Baalism. Then, a showdown, “Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, theh follow him?' Elijah proposed a teat: put a bullock on Baal’s altar and one on Jehovah's altar, let the Baal prophets call on their god to devour their sacrifice by fire, let Elijah ask Jehovah to consume his by fire, and the .deity who answers ia the true God. The 450 demon prophets “called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon&quot;, They shouted and leaped, and cut themselves with knives and lances after them manner till the blood gushed.” But no answer. Then, “ft capie to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.”—1 Kings 18: 21-28, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">A. 8. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah Mocks and Derides</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Elijah mocked the false prophets, ridiculed them, taunted them, sarcastically suggested to them that their god was preoccupied, or astray, or asleep on the job and needed to be roused. Was Jehovah displeased, did He deem His sarcastic prophet intolerant? No, for despite the handicap that Elijah's sacrifice was repeatedly drenched with water “the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the atones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench”. (1 Kings 18: 30-38, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font19"> What God approves shall we disapprove?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">If one disapproves of properly used sarcasm ho will have to disapprove of, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 8, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">not only </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font19"> not only prophets, not only apostles, not only Christ, but also Jehovah Himself! When men and nations plot and rage after world domination they scheme against Jehovah, for He has given World rulership to Christ's kingdom. How does God react? “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision,&quot; Or, “The Lord mocks at them; the Lord makes sport of them/' (Psalm 2:4; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt; An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font19"> In other words, they are a joke, make themselves a laughingstock. Puny men warring against Almighty God? Too ridiculous to take seriously. Worthy only of mocking gibes and derisive laughter. Jehovah reserves for himself the last laugh: “I in my turn will laugh in the hour of your doom, I will mock when your terror comes.&quot;—Proverbs 1: 26, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">As men sow they reap. If they persist in planting folly they must expect to haryest ridicule. Certainly Christendom's religions sow folly in the name of serving God. Their sermons range from silly twaddle to political meddling. They wheedle and beg, demand and gamble for money. Much of their public praying is nauseatingly selfish or maddeningly blasphemous. (Matthew 6:5; James 4:3) Jehovah evaluates such spiritual feasts and sacrifices as follows: “I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts.” (Malachi 2:3; Amos 5:21, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font19"> In the name of tolerance Jehovah God does not silently tolerate impure sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Whff “Awake!” Uses Cutting Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">False teaching in God's name must be attacked in a spirited way, with righteous indignation, appealing not only to the mind but also to the heart, not just to the intellect but to the emotions as well, to impress the hearer or reader with the seriousness of the error. The issue is bigger than avoiding wounded religious pride. It is a matter of eternal life</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">or eternal death, and better to wound now with corrective words that cut than to tolerate in silence the evil and allow the evildoer to land himEelf and others in the ditch of destruction. (Proverlia 28 : 23; Matthew 15:14) Furthermore, the isHiie is bigger than human salvation ; God's name is involved. It must be cleared, vindicated. Hence it is necessary to roll up the sleeves of our vocabulary to grapple adequately with the many blasphemies against our Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In their tight against satanic error Christians ask no quarter, want none, get none, and give none. They have courage to speak unpopular trntn, and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake I </span><span class="font17">standk shoulder to shoulder with them, Unwilling to disembowel itself of in les. tinal fortitude to please men or Devil. After strong speech from Jesus religionists complained, 'TTs a ho dost thou insult F<sup>J</sup> ^Luke 11:45, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font17"> But Jesus did not change His way of speaking. When Paul attacked idolatrous religion its devotees feared that “the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised&quot; and especially that “this business of ours will be discredited&quot; Boi even threat of mobbing did not alter Paul’s message. (Acts 19:23-29; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer, Trans.)</span><span class="font17"> Neither will </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> convert to the stylish doctrine of tolerance for religious error, which is no more than a subtle scheme of Satan to gag Christian mouths. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> will not “develop character&quot; with the tolerationists and set itself up as “holier than Bible writers&quot; and “holier than Jehovah&quot;, who were not averse to strong and sarcastic speech to slash and rip away the sheep’s clothing behind which religious wolves mas. querade.-—Matthew 7 :15; 2 Corinthians 11 :13-15, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer, Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Because </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> is written for persons of good-will and not for errant religious leaders, some may question the use of sarcasm aimed at clergymen. But what about the Bible sarcasm T Many times the barbed remarks were spoken directly to the offenders, but not always. Even when they Were, usually the common people were standing by to see the outcome. Others were present when Elijah needled the Baal prophets. And Jesus' scathing denunciation of. the scribes and Pharisees. Doesn’t it open with-these words: “Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples&quot;! (Matthew 23:1) Moreover, hasn’t God caused all this BarcHarri to be recorded in the Bible, which is circulated to all classes of persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Bowmm,</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> thin point etinntd be too forcefully made, namely, that sarcasm should be the exception rather than the ride, and then used only when facts have been presented that justify it.</span><span class="font17"> Remember how Elijah waited for a full morning of failure by the Dual prophets before ho mocked them, at noontime!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In conclusion, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> cannot please all. It does not try to. The Jews wanted a sign, the Greeks wanted showy wisdom. Jehovah God gave them neither, so His message was a/stumblingstone to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks. (1 Corinthians 1:22,23) Yet God did not allow them to dictate the message to Iff preached. Nor are the world's skep-tics or its wise men of today allowed to dictate His message. The aim of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font17">is not circulation at any price, popularity at any price, or religious peace at any price. The magazine's purpose is to please God, to tell facts, to expose hypocrisy and blasphemy, to comfort jnourn-ers, to show the Kingdom hope to a world overflowing with misery and woe, to point to Jehovah's righteous new world. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> writes for those who sigh and cry for all the abominable conditions in the land, who are not satisfied 'with present conditions or imperfect human leaders but who look for something better. Ah it strives to meet this purpose it sticks to righteous principles, Bible principles, and among which is found full justification for sturdy speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And in those righteous Bible principles nothing is found to justify evil in the name of tolerance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">________ noticeable X thing about Japan is its people. Everywhere you look there are people both old and young. Plenty of people uu the eidcwalks; plenty more in the € streets. People on bicycles and people rui buses mid streetcars. Everywhere masses of people—some riding, some walking, and some just stand ing around or squatting on their heels. In city or country there are people wherever one goes, and wherever there are people there are babies. Most of the women party habits on their backs, and tied to the backs of many young girls and boys are more babies. The baby-rjiiRnig business is indeed one of Japan's greatest industries, with production figures well over a million births a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Feeding the hungry mouths of this vast population is the most serious problem. There are approximately 80,000,000 people living in 147,690 square miles, yet only 15 percent of this area can be cultivated, because the greater part of the islands is Tnoiiiitairious. During the war most of the food went to the military forces, so much so that even workers in the war industries got only two light meals a day. Since the ending of hostilities conditions have gradually improved, and this last year, the first in many, the people seemed to have gotten enough to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By stringent government control on both production and consumption, Japan is able to raise approximately 85 percent of her food. All basic items are rationed </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 8, lU5ti</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">and prices are fixed by the government, A quota system is used for all farms, one in which the kinds of crops, the area planted for each crop, the quantity produced, as well as the price received for each foodstuff, is set by the Japanese authorities. If a farmer is unable to raise his quota, lie goes to the blackmarket, buys the balance needed, and turns it over to the quota-collecting agency for about one-fifth of what it cost him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Bice is the chief item in the diet, with just enough pickled turnip or other vegetable and h small amount of dried nah. added to make the dish tasty. White and sweet potatoes, wheat, barley and corn are raised in limited amounts. Seasonings, such as soy sauce, ginger, sesame, etc., are extensively used. Green tea. without sugar or milk, is the national drink, for coffee, though enjoyed, is priced out of the general public's reach. Steamed beans are a favorite breakfast food, and early in the day, from five to six o'clock, men and boys on bicycles or afoot go through the streets and lanes selling steamed beans, often slightly fermented. As they go they ring out </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Nato! Nato!&quot;</span><span class="font17"> You see, it is considered impolite to shout, and the Japanese are sticklers for politeness, so they sing their bean song ever so loudly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Foreigners are required to purchase their food from Overseas Sales Stores, provided for that purpose. All the food in these stores is imported so as not to further burden the limited donieistic supplica. The canned and packaged foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font17">mostly from tha </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">United States with </span><span class="font17">butter coming from </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Denmark, </span><span class="font17">cheese from Italy, oleo from the U«SJL and meat from Canada and South America, Clothing, cars, gasoline and fuel for heating are also sold by this Overseas organization, but only to foreigners.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Housing, No. 2 Problem</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">The Tokyo-Yokohama area has the greatest population, with the second-densest section in Osaka-Kobe, In the Tokyo area it is estimated that out of every 100 homos, 65 were destroyed during the war by explosives and fire bombs. Rebuilding has progressed slowly, bo today housing is stih a major problem, second only to food. The people are crowded together in tho smallest possible </span><a href="http://Hpn.ce"><span class="font17">HpH.ce,</span></a><span class="font17"> with many families living in a single tiny room. These houses, with their thin wails, multiple sliding windows and doors, and their flimsy paper-covered .sliding partitions, are highly suitable for the warm summer weather. But how tragic for the cold winter Beason! Japanese homed have no central heating systems; only small charcoal stoves for cooking, big enough </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font17"> a single pot. There are no warm ovbratuffed aofas in which to curl up. One sits nn the cold floor, nt best only thinly padded. At night there is no warm bed in which to sleep, A large stuffed </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">fulan</span><span class="font17"> about one-third as thick as a mattress spread on the floor serves as a bed—delightfully cool in the summer; miserably and painfully cold in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Coming to these islands in tbc winter, visitors might think the ruby-red cheeks of the children are the picture of health. On a second look, however, they would gee that the cheeks and bands of the poor children are badly chapped from the cold. Their noses seem to be always running during the winter months, This sad condition is due to their cold houses and their lack of sufficient clothing. Clothing is another serious problem for the masses, for many of them lost their entire wardrobes in the wartime fires and have since beep unable to replace them. Clothing is rationed and a</span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">ny</span><span class="font17"> made of cotton in quite expensive, while the older women still wear the Japanese kimono, the younger women and girls prefer Western styles. All mon, with the exception of the beskirtod priests, wear Western costumes in public, but at home, especially the older men, like to relax in robes centuries-old in design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Sanitation conditions, while not as primitive as in Minin parts of the earth, are nonetheless much worse than they Bhould be. With few exceptions there are no modern baths or toilet facilities in the homes of the people. Each neighborhood in the large towns has a public hath available for a small fee. The sewerage system, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">however, is twHd</span><span class="font17"> (te/riff/whte. Tor-lets equipped with wooden buckets must be emptied every ten days, the service charge being 10 yen the bucketful. The contents of these '‘honey buckets*<sup>1</sup>, aa they are called, arc carted off to the farms and used as fertilizer. In the summertime when the “honey carts” are passing they radiate such a terrible and in describable stanch if reaches io high heaven, forcing the whole neighborhood to close all doors and windows despite the excessive heat.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Other Difficulties and Problem*</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">Tn the, Tokyo area .besides the streetcars and buses there are electric trains serving the principal sections, and most of the time these are all jammed to the limit with people. Gasoline is sb highly restricted it is seldom used and most trucks and taxis operate on charcoal or wood-burning furnaces. A fanny sight to see these stop to fire up. Such clouds of billowy smoke! From a short distance it appears the whole neighborhood is on fire. Most hauling, including loads the size of 5 or 6 telephone poles, is by means of bicycle trailers or pushcarts. As a visitor, ox- and horse-drawn carts would attract your attention because the &quot;drive/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">instead of riding, always walks ahead leading the plodding animal and its load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Throughout this country human power is still the most common force used to turn the wheels of indue try. Electrical, Diesel and steam power is still very limited. The farms average only </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">2j acres</span><span class="font17"> in size and here handpowcr is used to sow, cultivate and harvest the crops, including grains, It is hardly correct to call it ‘‘manpower”, since the women arc the cidef burden-bearers, After doing a man’s share of work in the field the women take cure of the cooking, homeinaking and the raising of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Whether due to a lag in education during the war, or an inadequate system of teaching, the average college graduate of Japan is hardly equal in general knowledge to the average /\rn«r-ican high-school graduate. On the whole the Japanese also seem handicapped with a lack of initiative, perhaps due to centuries of regimentation when they wore told when to think, what to think, when to act and how to act. Receiving freedom now, they do not seem to know how to make full use of it to their best advantage.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Japan's &quot;Big Brother*’</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">The occupation of Japan by the Allied powers has heen beneficial educationally, socially and in many othor ways, for these people have received valuable training in conducting along democratic lines their own government, schools, hospitals and other institutions. Public health and sanitation engineers have come in to supervise the construction of modern underground sewerage systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Along industrial Hne^modern methods have been introduced, improvements in wo rising hours and conditions have been made, and a long-overdue emancipation of Japan's women from their life of servitude has begun. These advancements, it is true, have manifested themselves only in the large populated areas, and it will require a long time for them hi penetrate the rural communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">FSBR VARY</span><span class="font17"> 5, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">1350</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;Benevolent and protective,<sup>1</sup>’ that is th&amp; way the Japanese speak of the Occn-pation forces—Japan's <sup>#e</sup>biff brother*. By ^protective” they refer to the immediate threat of communism that has moved right up to Japan's back door in China. Within the country the communists are only a small minority, only about 5 percent, yet they are exceedingly vocal in their statements and plenty active in instigating nets of violence. Politically, the remainder of the population U, roughly speaking, about (55 percent in favor of I he policies of the Occupation and about 30 percent either disinterested. uninformed or too old and sot in their way of thinking to wish any change from the traditional feudal Hystem of the paat. Religiously, Japan today is about the same as it has been for the past hundreds of years, and, no doubt, if the apostle Paul were to visit this country today he would exclaim, as he did in Athena 1000 years ago, &quot;in all things yon are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.* (Acts 17:22, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Diagloit</span><span class="font17"> translation) The so-called <sup>li</sup> Christum&quot; missionaries that have Hocked here in great numbers since the war have done little to change this condition. There are thousands udod thousands of shrines and temples, nig ones and small ones, each and ail dedicated to some demon god.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Everything the people do seems to have a religious significance. When frog leg* are exported, one of the pagan priests is called to comfort the &quot;spirits” of the frogs. When eels are eaten to give health during the coming winter, a religious ritual is observed to comfort the &quot;spirits&quot; of the eels before cooking. When a house is to he built, the priests of these pagan gods are called to erect an altar and io declare which way 1 he house may face and where the windows and doors may be put. Almost every home has its own altar where the poor and ignorant householder offers food, flowers and prayers to his gods.</span></p>

A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.

<p><span class="font26">O</span><span class="font17">F ALL the panicky signs of a dis-astron? oil shortage during 1948, the ninst alarming appeared in the form of a price upshot that catapulted crude oil from $1.25 to $3*00 a barrel delivered on the New York market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Oil tycoons, economic prophets and political soothsayers painted the sign* of the times in such lugubrious colors that TT, S, foreigri-policy makers worked overtime* to involve America in an all-out defense program covering Greece, Turkey, Iran, Arabia and the general Middle East area. A cordon of treaties, pipelines and guns was thrown up around the fabulously rich Middle East oil reserves Irei ng exploited by British and American oil monopolies. A cold war of hot words and bristling threats reverberated hack and forth across the border between Iran and Soviet Russia, and still rumbles on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Keynote of the warning cries that nil, &quot;the lifehlood of economy/' was apt to be nut off by the Russian bear was struck by the chief of the State Depar hnent’s office of Near Eastern Affairs, Loy W. Henderson. He shuddered out loud through the American jtrcsw and radio to. think that if Anglo-American domination of oil production in the Middle East were interfered with by the Russians, the Communists would be “in a position to hamper, if not pervert the rehabilitation of western Europe and to retard the economic development of Africa and southern Asia’&quot;. No one in the political realm stopped to ask why the world’s recovery</span></p>

Rather, on July 25, 1949, President Truman called for a stepped-up arms program that would pour $300,000,000 more into the defenses of the Middle East and ilu gateway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And the general piyblic, frightened by the specter of gasoline rationing and heatless homes, naa swallowed the hysteria.

<p><span class="font17">ATTwri</span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">mtn</span><span class="font17"> ingenuity to make the country dependent tor oil upon any foreign sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">True, at present rate of consumption the 22 billion barrels of proved oil resources remaining in the ground of continental United States would be exhausted in another 11 years. Prospectors *ho really feel an oil scare, however, seem always to find more new oil-producing areas. (In 1925 the nation had known reserves big enough to last only 10 years.) And of the two thousand million barrels of oil consumed each year a prodigious amount of it is wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Proponents of self-sufficiency point to improved cracking processes that can now double the yield of gasoline from petroleum. New techniques of drilling can sink hti old-fashioned 3,000-foot well down to 18,OOQ feet and the well of ton-times comes to life again to produce from SO percent to 50 percent of its original yield. Thus countless fields of America’s 425,000 oil wells (95 percent of the world's total) may proyc to be found hoarding new frontiers right under their own derricks. And what can be said for the still available natural reserves at the tip of America’s drill bits can be said for Canada, Mexico, Brazil, or just about any other area in the Western Hemisphere or in Africa or in Europe, or even to some extent in the island country of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Then, besides the still unproved areas in. the United States, there is h land area ft one-half million square miles in the Alaskan, Canadian and Arctic regions where oil seepages reveal unknown reserves of oil that can be drawn off at less expense than fighting a third world war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is likely that the investigators who argue for the development of a self suffi cient. oil industry go to extremes in their predictions. They estimate that there are at hand sufficient reserves within the U. S. national boundaries to supply American ecniiorny with gasoline and other petroleum products at present rates of consumption for a thousand years. Even though some of their estimates must be taken with a grain of salt, it is refreshing to turn for a moment from the oil-scare hysteria to hear what these investigators have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Tidefajuft</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Over and above the practice of oil conservation, new cracking processes and drilling techniques, and the tapping of uncharted areas, the optimists point to an entirely new frontier of oil-prod doing ground. It is an area one-twoHth the size of the nation’s land area. Proved rich in petroleum wnd other nahind rewmn!-ea, the new frontier extends seaward and under water. It consists of the continental shelf or land masses less than 600 feet helow the surface of the seas. The land masses or “tidelands” extend under the shallow waters of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico as far as thirty miles and more, narrowing under the Pacific waters in places to as little as five miles, but yielding to ingenious methods of underwater well-drilling to disclose at least 10 billion barrels of oil, or almost half the known remaining land reserves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Although dangerous, underwater oil prospecting is admittedly less hazardous than fighting an atomic war oyer oil. It is expensive, or cheap, depending on the way one looks at it. One underwater well 14,000 feet deep costs half a million dollars; hut one B-36 superfighter costs as much as fifteen of these oil wells. A floating platform big enough to house work crews tea miles off shore and strong enough to withstand ocean hurricanes costs anywhere from $200,000 (the price of an obsolete bomber) to $2,000,000 (the price of two atom bombs). Not long ago Congress voted $24,000,000 for scientific research on oil developments, and $189,-000,000 for the construction of one super aircraft carrier This latter project was scuttled ia favor of 39 B-36 bombers costing $300,000,000. That is ten times all the lease money bo far spent Cm tideland oil grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And what if all the continental shelves bordering all the countries in the world were tapped! </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font17"> is said that they would yield thirty million cubic miles of oilbearing sediments to produce 500 billion barrels of oil.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Oil from Shale and Coal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">Another immeasurable reservoir of oil lies compressed and untapped in common shale rock. Containing from 5 to 80 gallons of liquid fuel to the ton, shale can be found in many states in the United States. The richest area yet discovered is the gigantic Green River formation, stretching through 2,600 square miles of western Colorado, 4,700 square mites of Utah and 9,200 square mites of Wyoming. One lone mountain in Colorado te assayed to hold 300 billion barrels of oil, waiting to he roasted out of the rock. That is six times as much oil as the world has consumed since the first oil well was sunk in the United States, in 1859. It is enough, this 1,000-square-niile mountain of oil, to keep America s autos, planes, Diesel locomotives, oil-consuming industries and two million home furnaces going at current rates for generations. To get an impression of its richness, jimt consider: a single 70-foot seam in the Colorado shale mountain treasures twenty times as much oil as was found in the fabulous east Texas oil Strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Experimentation proves that oil can be extracted from shale rock for about $2.60 a barrel and piped to California and New York at no greater cost than natural crudes cost at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The remaining proved natural oil deposits, currently estimated at 22 billion barrels, constitute only 0.4 percent of the oil that eofild be produced in the United States. Seven times as much oil can be extracted from shale; and yet shale oil constitutes only 3.6 percent of the known potential. By far the most prodigious storehouse of synthetic liquid fuels is to be found in coat Coal constitutes.more than 95 percent of America’s mineral fuel-energy reserves. At present consumption rates, that is enough fuel energy to laid the country for 3,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There are two basic methods in use for converting coal into oil—direct hydrogenation and gnu synthesis. The less expensive conversion, by hydrogenation, produces gasoline at a cost of 12o to 15e a gallon. </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An</span><span class="font17"> experiment, now under way in Alabama, may by-pass both methods by an inexpensive short cut. The new method is to ignite an underground coal mine and catch the escaping gas and convert it into liquid fuels.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Cost of a Synthetic OU Industry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">While these mountains, mines and oceans of oil have been lying around thetri all the time, the big oil prospectors have shunned the initial costs of exploiting them. More immediate profits lay in tapping oil fields of natural erodes where ver I hey could find them, even though it be thousands nf miles from home within the boundaries of precarious nations where the greedy struggle for oil endangers world stability and threatens to touch off a third world war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Servite government officiate, toadying to the demands of the prospectors, have paid scant attention to the black-gold mines in their own back yards. Not until the Nasi menace to world domination threatened American fuel supplies were the oil tycoons and politteal lackeya forced to acknowledge the oil substitutes on the home front. It was as late ae 1948 that Congress voted the first noteworthy search for petroleum reserves. It allotted the Bureau of Mines $24,000.000 to explore the synthetic field. That amount is hardly two-thirds of the $38,000,000 which the Arabian oil monopoly, Aramco, filched from the IT. S. Navy in overcharges for Middle East oil during the heat of World War II. It is just one-fourth the $99,000,000 which dw United States poured into- Saudi Arabih up to-1947 in behalf of Aramco's oil coilceis^iona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On its modest budget, the Bureau of Mines has already produced evidence sufficient to prove that the United States (or almost any similar area on earth) could develop a synthetic oil industry that would make the country self-suffi-cient under almost any conceivable conditions, The Bureau has proposed the construction of a gigantic fuels industry. If built, it would become the biggest single American industry, employing millions of people, and producing the minimum requirement of 2,0(10,000 barrels a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If the bureau’s program were adopted, natural gas would be converted into motor gasoline at the rate of 150,000 barrels a day. Shales would supply 850,000 barrels a day of heating oils. Coni would contribute one million barrels of various type fuels to round out the program. Big oil companies, fighting the program, say the cost of the industry would be closer to 18 billion dollars instead of 12 billion dollars. But seeing that modem Americans have &quot;billifius for extravagant waste, nothing for social welfare”, wby haggle over a paltry six billion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Twelve billion dollars is slightly more than is spent in one year on the navy, air force and anny combined. It is four-fifths the 15-billioii-dollar annual cost of nonmilitary defenses. It might not be venturing too far to say this: If Aramco and similar economic monopolies were 'eft to shift for themselves on Russia's doorstep, enough could be shaved off the 42-billion-dollar defense program to build the synthetic fuels industry proposed by the bureau. Such candid opinions must be simmering near the surface of the minds of men like Dr. Wilbur C. Schroeder, head of the Office of Synthetic Liquid Fuels, In speaking out for the synthetic fuels program, Dr. Schroeder said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the start, costs may be higher than for ml from foreign sources. But security can be worth this added cost. If a ^ynthetirj? industry should prevent a war, or make it possible to win a war, the added cost would be a small one to pay. Repeatedly in the past the cost of synthetic products baa been high in the beginning, but in the end they have been as cheap ofl or cheaper than natural products.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Situation Certain of Adjustment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">It is not the purpose of this article to advocate a political or economic program for a nation to follow. It. is the purpose here to draw attention to the bountiful provision made by earth's Creator for its inhabitants. By bo doing the Creator hiniseH can he seen to stand absolved and guiltless of promoting any greedy squabble over the wealth of the planet. The wealth is here in superabimdancH and in such variety of form as to challenge and absorb the marvelous brainpower of humanity in exploiting it fairly, with no time or reason to waste in deceiving, cheating, fighting and destroying each other—as well as earth's resources—over a selfish love of gain and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is the purpose here to answer those who ask why, it the Creator has done all this, He has not exercised a righteous dispensation of earth's affairs. The answer is that in His patience the Creator has placed the written testimony containing His purposes for creation before men's eyes for thousands of years for them to learn, and they have not learned. The time is at hand for Him to make the proper and permanent adjustment of all affairs of human society and “destroy them which destroy the earth”, if it must come to that (Revelation 11:18) Those who scoff and ask &quot;TVhere is the sign of all this!” have only to look'abroad at earth's present-day affairs which so manifoldly fulfill the prophetic Bible blueprint, and then acknowledge that it is so.—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">advertisement headed, “But Can It Be Eouird in Ihn Rihle?” The definite purpose of the ad is to show that finding it in the Bible is not an essential requirement, and that the Bible is not an adequate &quot;rule of faith<sup>1</sup>’, hut requires the addition of tradition. The reason for this effort is that the Roman Catholic Church holds numerous teachings and observances that not only are omitted in the Bible but arc not even hinted at in what the Bible teaches. The general idea is, however, that the Catholic Church has merely added certain things that are nouessential, and that other religious denominations reject. There is more to it than that. But, to examine the ad a little further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We read, &quot;Christianity did not begin with the Bihlp, Tt began with the coming 'of Christ/<sup>5</sup> While this expresses a fact, it does not tell the whole story; and, since the purpose is to discredit the Bible as a sufficient guide for Christians, it.merits further examination. It is remarkable how closely Christianity from its very begin [tings is linked with Scripture (which admittedly preceded Christianity). Christ demonstrated His own Messiahship from the Word of God, and at His baptism said, “Tie, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, 0 God.”—Psalm 40: 7,8; Hebrews 10: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Even before He began His ministry He used the things written to repulse the tompier, referring faithfully to the Word of God, (Luke 4:4,8,12) Then, announcing His ministry at Nazareth, He again appealed to the Bible, quoting the prophet Esaias (Isaiah), (61 : 1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Throughout Ills ministry Jesus constantly appealed to the written Word of God, saying repeatedly “It is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">written&quot;. </span><span class="font17">He did not quote tradition except to condemn it. (Matthew 15:3-9) Even after His resurrection He instructed His disciples from the Bible, saying, not that they were slow to helievn </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Him,</span><span class="font17"> but that they were “slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken&quot;. (Luke gin </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">without</span><span class="font17"> the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The ad mentions that the church is “the pillar and mainstay” of the truth. (1 Timothy 3:15) But how was the early church the pillar (supporter) of the truth! Evidently by holding fast the Word of life, not by pushing it into the background. (Philippians 2:16, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt) </span><span class="font17">The apostles, like the Master, continually quoted I he Word of God as support for Iheir preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An attempt is next made to insinuate doubt by saying, “The last part of the Bible, written by St. John , , , was not completed until 60 years after the crucifixion of Christ/’ The part that John wrote, while of great value, particularly today, was, for the most part, symbolic and prophetic, and evidently the Lord saw no nesd of hastening it. But this fact does not mean that the church then did not have the Bible. They had the apostles while these carried on their ministry, and after the death of the apostles, including John, they had tbeir writings, and these in the providence of God completed die Sacred Record, making it a harmonious whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a remarkable fact that the early Christians had the all-but-completed Word, m </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">writing</span><span class="font17"> witbin the generation</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">that witnessed the death of Christ Jesus. They had three records of the life of Christ, one of them by A.D. 41, only eight years after Jesus’ death. Also they had the richly full writings of the apostle Paul, and the epistles of Peter, Jude and James. This left only the three brief epistles of John to be added, together with his gospel, which was meanwhile unquestionably circulated orally, and finally the Revelation (Apocalypse), to complete the canon. And these were all supplied before the last of that generation passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In view of these facts the statement of the ad is seen to be a dodge, when it says, “There was no Bible in anything resembling its present form until nearly .400 years after Jesus had died on the cross.” As though the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font19"> made a particle of difference. That they </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font19"> have the Bible is evident from the words of Polycarp, disciple of the apostle John, who wrote (A.D. 107) to the Philippians: “1 trust that you are well read in Holy Scripture and that nought is hid from you?' He would surely not write this had these Philippians had no access to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Then, “the widespread distribution of the Bible as we know it today was impossible until the invention of printing, some 1400 years after the Savior’s death. By what ‘rule of faith* did the millions of Christians live during those 1500 years?” This does not make a point, for if the early Christians in the days of Polycarp could he expected to be well read in Scripture, those of later and more advanced times also might have heen expected to have ready access to the Bible. As a matter of fact, the Roman Catholic Church, arguing from another angle, will insist that many Bibles in the language of the people </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font19"> circulated even before Luther (hence before the invention of printing). They also contend that monks often spent all their time copying the Bible in Latin, so that it </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">could</span><span class="font19"> have been provided in larger numbers for the benefit of the people had</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">not the Catholic Church itself hindered such distribution, as it did all too often. Still it </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font19"> circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tradition Contradicts Scriptures</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Then the advertisement makes much of the fact that there are so many Protestant denominations, though it ignores for the occasion the divisions within the Roman Catholic Church itself, whose “unity” is more apparent than real. But what is more important is that the chief fault of the denominations is not their difference one from another, but their similarity to Catholicism in the most important doctrines. It is here that the effect of tradition shows itself most plainly. It is not that the Catholic Church has made some additions to the Bible that are of secondary importance. It is that things are taught and believed that are entirely at variance with the Bible. Tradition, in other words, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">fundamentally contradicts</span><span class="font19"> the Bible. It is in the chief doctrines that arc taught that this contradiction is evident:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">1. The doctrine of consciousness of the soul between death and resurrection, which the Scriptures deny.—Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">2. The doctrine of “eternal torment” of the unsaved, also unscriptural.—Psalm 37: 20; Ezekiel 18:4; Romans 6: 23, and dozens of other equally clear statements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">3. The doctrine of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">equality</span><span class="font19"> of the Father, Son and holy spirit, nowhere taught in Scripture.—1 Corinthians 8:6; John 14:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">4. The doctrine of literal burning up of the earth at “’the end of time”.—Ecclesiastes 1:4; Isaiah 45:18, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">5. The doctrine of “divine right” of the clergy and of kings and other rulers of nations.—John 18:36; 1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Not one of these teachings will stand the test of Bible investigation. This is something that can be proved from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">AWAKE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Scripture b by any reasonable person. The addition of nnaeriptural tradition, on the other hand, has fostered these errors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition to the foregoing errors shared by Protestants and Boman Catholics, there are others which the Protestants have rejected, such as the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">1. The doctrine of Purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">2&gt; The doctrine of prayer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font17"> the dead and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font17"> the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">3. The doctrine of extreme veneration for the mother of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">None of these things are so much as hinted at in the Scriptures&quot; record of the life of the early church. As this record covers the time of the apostles, is it not strange that these intiiHHte rwords should so entirely omit the most outstanding current observances and doctrines? Would the tone of the writings be bo completely different from the actual state of things, as would be the case if the church had been anything like'the Roman Catholic Church of today? The answer is obvious. They are not mentioned because they did not exist and they are not eveu in harmony with what </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font17"> mentioned. Again tradition is shown to be unsafe, untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Bible, Not Tradition, the Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The ad conclude!; with an invitation to the reader to '‘examine the rule of faith of the flint Chris tin ns” by writing for the booklet. The booklet enlarges upon the ad, but fails to demonstrate that the first Christians did other than what the book of Acts and the w’ri+ings of the apostles show they did. Those truthful writings emphasize the pre-eminent place of the Bible (not tradition) in the early church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Timothy knew the Scriptures from childhood, and Paul said these same Scriptures were able To make wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus', knowledge of whom was conveyed by the preaching of the apostles and subsequently by their writings. Again ha urged Timothy to set an example by his use of the Word of truth, saying that “all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God ruay De perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works&quot;.—2 Timothy 3:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Paul thus showed that Scripture was an adequate and complete rule of faith, able to cornplei+dy equip the man of God. He &lt;fid not mention tradition as being of equal value* or even helpful. He ignores it. In view of this fact his statement at 2 Thessalonianb 2: 15, quoted in the ad to “prove” the Catholic position, is shown to do nothing of the kind. Paul there merely refers to certain particular w-</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">stTuctions</span><span class="font17"> (4» </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">American Translation), </span><span class="font17">He was not commending tradition as understood by the Catholic Church today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On another occasion, when*Paul was taking leave of the Ephesians, he commended them to God and the Word of His grace (not tradition). That Word, he said, was able to build them up and give theVn an inheritance among all the sanctified. (Acts 20:32) Yes, the bunk that really shows the rule of faith followed by the early Christiana is the book of Acts. And it shows that they adhered closely to the Bible, the Word of God, which was completed in tbeir day. The early Christians even did what the nd suggests ‘should not be done, for they searched the Scriptures to see whether what the apostles taught them could he found in the Bible. For this they were commended, not condemned-Aetw 17:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Obtain a waterproof tray or metal window box. This provides a good place to set the clay pots and protects the windowsills from any water that might splash oat while watering them. Cover the bottom with several inches of coarse gravel or pebbles, you may use even a thick coating of moss. Make sure the pots are not touching or sitting in the water. If there is a radiator or other heat coming up under or very close so as to pass through the foliage or heat the pots, be sure some protective hoard is placed to prevent direct contact with the jots or foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For containers there is a wide variety to be obtained at florists or other garden supply houses. Window boxes tn fit the length of your window can be obtained reasonably, There are many different glazed pots and those of plastic that can be used to set cl ay -put ted specimens in for better display purposes. There are some in the form of animals and other odd designs. These can be very ornamental if used for single plants and not grouped tightly in a collection. A® for new day pots, soak them in water until they absorb all they can before uae, otherwise they will rob the soil of its water. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you use pota that do not have drainage holes in the bottom, such as the glazed ornamental pots in the form of animals, you must make sure there is sufficient gravel, pebbles, or broken bits of pots placed in the bottom to allow for a certain amount of drainage. The amount of water poured in must be a limited measure to avoid a stagnant supply collecting on-the bottom or souring the soil. In these kinds of pots, add a little charcoal to keep the soil sweet</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now that the place and location and equipment are ready, what are the rules and regulations for the care of house plants? What kind of soil, and when and how often do I water my plants f Remember, plants are living things and will respond to proper treatment. Their re-Suirements differ; each is an individual, fo rigid rules will bring success but you will find that you u the caretaker can Jewm their requirements. After a little experimenting, providing the fundameib tai necessities dictated by the natural environment from which the plant came, you will soon learn how to grow hoqse plants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The requirements for healthful growth are the same mm iIhihh for humans. Good food, which is proper soil, plenty of fresh air, water both for baths and to drink through soil, and sunshine and fresh air with proper temperatures, will bring success. Light furnishes the power to grow: air they breathe through their leaves and give off moisture by evaporation; for better health, supply moist air. The soil furnishes the raw food material .which passes through the roots to the sterna and leaves.

<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab you may know, different plants require different types of soil mixtures. Some flourish on slim diet with rocky, sandy, dry soil; such as the cacti. Others, such as ferns, begonias and African violets, require a rich mixture of lenfmold and fibrous soil with much organic matter and little sand, A good mixture for general use, considering that a great percentage of house plants are grown on much poorer eoil, is composed of two parts good garden soil; one part sharp clean sand (for porous aeration and dram ago); one part compost, leafmold or humus. The humus or leafmold makes the soil mallow and friable with Maier-holding power. For plants needing further enrich merit and sweetening, add a teaspoonful of btwm meal for each five-inch pot »</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each plant differs in its water requirements. This al*o depends on the condition of the weather or the room, H the location is hot and dry, plants dry out sooner, requiring water of tenor. Certain plants, like the sucrulenlN and cacti, require water infrequently, but thoroughly to simulate desert conditions. Ferns and African viola fa and begonias require water more frequently and abundantly. A good rule is to let tho surface of the soil get fairly dry before adding more water. Overwatering does more harm than dryness, feome types prefer water supplied from the bottom, and plants going drirmant should have their water supply gradually decreased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Foliage Planta</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Foliage plants are the easiest plants to grow because they require the least light and attention. Many will grow in water alone with no direct sunlight, Their handsome foliage, often mottled in variegated forms, provides natural decoration in otherwise drab locations. Those that grow easily in water are philodendron, Chinese evergreen and Nephthytis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Dracaenas, sometimes called com plant because the leaves hang from tho center stem like a corn plant, have bright green loaves with white or yellowish markings running parallel with tho edge of the leaves, Some extremely beautiful varieties have rose-colored markings crowned by new leaves showing clear pink, giving the effect of blosaoms. The common coleus will always please you with a gorgeous array of leaves, bringing to you ail the brilliance of auturfln.

<p><span class="font17">The gloxinias and African violets are Suite similar in appearance and are of tie same family. The hairy leaves of both are velvetlike. The gloxinia, which some consider the lovelier of the two, is a native of tropical America, while the violet is from Africa, as its name informs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Gloxinias have volvctlike bell-shaped upturned flowers, hybrids of which produce blooms four or five inches across. They range in color from lavender and purple to pink and the deepest of reds. White-throated with pink or with lavender edges, or, conversely, dark ihremta and lighter edges, make wide selection possible. Buffled and speckled variations are unbeatable in loveliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The flowers of the African violet are less spectacular than the gloxinias. The violetlike flowers range from pink* white, red and several shadings of blue or lavender. They will grow in no direct sunlight but do enjoy the morning sun of an east window in the winter and full light of northern window in the summer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Christmas cactus should be on your list, for the lovely cerise pink blossoms prefer the time of the year when other plants may be holding back. This plant is nett difficult to grow. For other flowering ijidoor plants try geraniums in sunny window; lantana, impatients, flowering maple, and many others. The amaryllis, a spectacular contribution from i.he land of Brazil, is grown from a large bulb. A large hollow stem is thrust up and five or six trumpetlike flowers blow forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some blossoms measure 7 inches across. Colors to be chosen from are white, pink, red and orange, with, variations.

Their profuse flowers come in single and double varieties and they grow bushy in form. Then the large-leafed varieties, grown for their ornamental foliage, are fibrous-rooted. Of these interesting types with thick leaves and hairy stems, the Bex begonia is one of the most outstanding. Some types have large spectacular silvery leaves with inconspicuous flowers. Other varieties are silver- or purple-veined. The leaves are striking in contrast with other foliage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font26">J</span><span class="font17">EHOVAH’S consecrated people are in this world but are no part of it. (John 17:14-16; 15:19) They are in a position similar to that of Abraham sojourning in theland of Canaan. Just as Christians are admonished to keep separate from this contaminating old world, so Abraham kept himself separate from the inhabitants in Canaanland, He did not sin by falling in with their religious worship, and he even avoided close association with them for fear of acquiring some of their demon fonns of worship. He safeguarded his family circle from being -broken up by heathen idolaters, or being invaded by them through marriage tics. To his trusted servant..Abraham said: <sup>(i</sup>Swear by the Lord, the Ood of.beaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom T dwell: but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.”—Genesis 24: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Not only was Abraham’^ son Isaac profiled from demon-worship through entangling intermarriage with the Canaanites, but also Isaac’s son Jacob obtained a wife from the distant land of his own people and not from the Canaanite neighbors. &quot;And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thau shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go 1&lt;j Pudan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy ?ftoiher’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Lalian thy mother’s brother.”—Genesis 28:1,2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">had gone into Egypt, after they had been delivered from Egyptian bondage, and while they were in the wilderness eu route to the promised land of Canaan, Jehovah God gave them guiding laws, one of which was : &quot;When the Lord your -God brines you into the land which you arc invading for conquest, and clears out of your way great nations like the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorita*, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivvites, and Jebusitea, seven nations greater and stronger than yourselves; when the Low your God puts them at your mercy, and you defeat the zu, you must be sure to exterminate them, without making a covenant with thorn, or giving them any quarter; you most not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor receiving their daugh-lers for your sons; for they would turn your sons from following* me to serving alien gods/’—Deuteronomy 7:1-4, A® </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So important was this safeguarding of the consecrated people of God from contamination by close relationships with de tn on-worshipers that Jehovah again incorporates in His divine Law this instruction forbidding intermarriage, saying, &quot;Lest you make a compact with the ^nations, deserting to their gods, sacrificing to their gods, agreeing to partake of their sacrificial meals,. marrying your sons to their daughters, who will desert to their gods and make your sons desert also/'—Exodus 34:15,16, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">After Israel had entered Canaan and gained many victories over the enemies, it was still essential tn warn the Israel-</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">itee a^ay from entangling relations with the heathen, including the matrimonial relationship. &quot;Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the Itfft; that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: but cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day. Elee if yc do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto thorn, and they to you: know Tor a certainty that the Loan your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall he snares and traps unto you/’—Joshua 23:6-8,12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But there were always Israelites who thought they were strong enough spiritually to wed heathen women, enjoy the marriage tics, and at the same time resist the ensnaring effects of their wives’ demon religions. Yet God’s good counsel and command could not be ignored with impunity, not even by the wisest man in those olden Limes. That man was wise King Solomon. Of him it is written that he loved many foreign women, and took wives from among the heathen nations round about, and &quot;his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God”. This deliberate disobedience came after God had warned Solomon, after He had &quot;commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods:-but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded”.—1 Kings 11:1-11, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver,;</span><span class="font17"> see also Ezra 9:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do any Christians today feel wiser than Solomon, strong enough to resist in thetr own strength the inroads of subtle demon snares through marriage with non-believere? Do they feel that Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">God was exaggerating and greatly magnifying the danger a of marriage with those outside hie consecrated people! Or do they think such restraints .no lunger hold, since we are no longer under the law covenant! Then let them remember that similar warnings of separateness from this oid world are to be found in the Christian Greek Scriptures. For example, &quot;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: . . . what part hath he that believeth with an infidel! Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord.” —2 Corinthians 6:14,15,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Marriage of a consecrated Christian to hti nidmliever results in an unequal yoke and cannot help but produce unequal pulling and stress and friction, All should remember that marriage ties are liable to prove long-term bonds, because in God’s judicial court they cannot be lightly snapped as a triviality for some minor cause or for any t-ause less Ilian fornication by the unfaithful partner. These bonds may add responsibility and restrict i on h to one’s liberty that will last a lifetime. For this reason not only a first marriage but also a remarriage after death of one partner should be carefully weighed. The apostle Paul counsels: &quot;A wife is hound for as long a time as her husband is living; but if the husband have fallen asleep [in death], she is free to be marned unto whom she pleaseth, —only in the Lord?'—1 Corinthians 7:39, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The restriction here given concerning Christian widows desiring to remarry applies with equal force to any consecrated servant of God seeking a husband or wife, namely, to marry “in the Lord”. That means to marry a consecrated person like oneself. For a Christian to unequally yoke himself up with an unbeliever is not conducive to Christian welfare and is controlled more by passion. Such endangerment of the Christian's spiritual interests could hardly be pleasing to God or Christ.</span></p>

An editorial, for example, in the afybro </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Twining</span><span class="font17"> of June 3,1949, told how one Erik Andersson of Ludvikn was kpji-tcnocd to one month s imprisonment in 1944; two months’ imprisonment in 1918; and three months’ imprisonment in 1949. Commenting on this “shocking human tragedy” the editorial, in part, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The reason is that for con science' sake he has refused to do conscripted service of any kind. He is daily busy as a preacher and it is his conviction that he must not leave Ibis vocation on any terms, Seeing that he has already been in prison twice for this cause and now has been sentenced the third time one has no reason to doubt his honest conviction. A man does not go to prison of his free volition the third time—Considering all that this means tn serious mental suffering—if he is not moved by a strong faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This is a shocking human tragedy. It is almost inconceivable that such a thing could happen in enlightened Sweden in AD. 1049. . . .We do not stop at all to consider the creed of this man. From the standpoint of meting out justice it is immaterial. If he had been a Catholic, an atheist, a Mohammedan, a dissenter. or a <sup>&lt;f</sup>high church man”, it would have been equally absurd to punish his conviction in this manner. The law of Sweden states that no man’s conscience shall be coerced. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We have never heard him preach and cannot issue any statement vouching for him or his opinions. But it appears that the man is ready to anffcr about everything for his convictions. To then punish, punish, puniah and punish again in an endless row is something frightening—®jruel]iing one almost refuses to believe is possible in an enlightened, democratic, cultured government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">You nek, on what groundk do these young men refuse military conscription! In answer, we print the following from the defense speech given by one of these men last spring:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is not a crime cither before God or before men for one to bo faithful to the Lord to whom one has pledged himself to hdfvb. If I had sworn Oddity to the king of Sweden it would bo right to consider it a. deceitful 'action if I ffwerred from the service of this king and entered the service of another king in another conn try T have sworn fidelity to Chriat, King of kings and Lord of lords, and I have consecrated my life to serve and obey him. For this reason I feel myself bound by the Word of God ... to &quot;obey God rather than men”. (Acts 5:29]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The measure to punish a person because he refuses to shrink from his duty to obey God is tantamount to pronouncing Almighty God destitute of the right to have His servants on carth<sub>T</sub> wholly isolated for His purposes. Such a proceeding ought to be unworthy of a country that claims to be Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The paragraph which the prosecutor appealed to in his charge against me provides punishment for a warrior who has made himself guilty of insubordination to a superior. I do not qnestinn the right of the power of the state Io demand obedience of its warriors. But T am no warrior in the Swedish army. I am a Soldier of Jesus Christ”, as Paul calls himself and his Christian brethren. [2 Tim. 2:3, 4] And it is because I will not make myself guilty of insubordination to my </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">King</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font17"> that my ctmsoienee prevents me rroni performing military duty. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Mr, Judge, T am here as a poor follower of Jesus Christ, charged with a crime similar to that on which He was indicted, for having spoken against Caesar, against the power of the state, and he was sentenced to death by a heathen judge, who tried to release him when he saw that the accused was innocent. I am here before a court of justice where the law of God rests on the court’s table, and where the human lawbook, to which the prosecutor has appealed, says: “The judge shall judge in accordance with God's law and the law of the kingdom of Sweden/<sup>7</sup> , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Many sentences have been passed on Jeho-vfth'H witnesses in this country, sentences which have not been in accordance with the wise judicial rule: “More attention should be paid Lu the intention and the meaning than to the act.** “The Lord looketh on the heart.,” as it is stated in the Bible, at the motive of the actions ot men, and 1 beg that the court do so in my ease os welL [1 Sam, 16:7]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The law of God and the law of Sweden do not always agree, and the courts generally prefer in such cases to judge according to the latter. But for those individuals who have placed their lives eft the disposal of the Lord to be used in His service, and who see the seriousness of their position, there is no alternative. And happy the yourig men who, like the-ones above mentioned, are ‘remembering their Creator in the days of their youth’ (Feel. 12:1), and are ‘obeying God rather than men’, in due time they will have their reward from the One Lawgiver and Judge, from Jehovah God “who is ablfe to save anti Io destroy&quot; (Janies 12), from Him who can grant eternal life free of all military conscription in a righteous now world of everlasting peace I</span></p>

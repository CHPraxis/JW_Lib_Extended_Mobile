Experience in Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom
FRUITS OF NEIGHBOR LOVE IN TENNESSEE
“Here is the heart-warming story of a kind servant of Jehovah and a grateful wayfarer who had with him three little children. Some time ago out here in the mountains of Tennessee a witness was going home from a home Bible study. The evening was coming on and it was raining. As he drove slowly down the road he saw a man leading some little children by the hand and leaning into the driving rain. The witness stopped his car and invited them to ride down the road with him. It was learned that the man and children had come almost one hundred miles in the last few days in the rain. The witness invited them to come in and stay all night and have a meal. The wayfarer declined to stay in the house but did take some warm food and he and the children stayed all night in the barn. Before bedding down for the night the wayfarer got his interest aroused in the new world of righteousness, and received a gift copy of the book ‘Let God Be True’. Next morning after thanking his host for the food and housing and expressing his gratitude for the new Bible knowledge and the book, the wayfarer and his children were on their way. The story now shifts to a little town in Alabama: Keener. The wayfarer had moved on and the book had gone with him. He and his children stayed all night at a house in Keener, and he told his host about the new world of righteousness. His host showed interest, and wanted the book ‘Let God Be True’. But it was the wayfarer’s most prized possession; he could not part with it. But he told his host how to get one: write to the kind servant of Jehovah back in Tennessee. The host wrote the letter; he got his copy of the book, provided by the same servant of God who had first showed hospitality to a wayfarer. Once again it is seen that Jehovah is working in many ways that the ‘sheep’ may be found.”

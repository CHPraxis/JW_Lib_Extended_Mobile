<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since release of the <em>New World Translation </em>on August 2, 1950, at the international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Yankee Stadium, New York city, there has been widely published religious criticism over its rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 5:7, 8</a>. Therefore we append the following as a suitable footnote to those verses appearing on page 700:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 5:7, 8</strong></a><strong>: “For there are three witness bearers, the spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.”</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This rendering is according to the Greek texts by Westcott and Hort (1881) and by D. Eberhard Nestle (18th edition of 1948) and by José María Bover, S.J. (1943) and by Augustinus Merk, S.J. (6th edition of 1948).</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After “witness bearers” the cursive Manuscripts No. 61 (of 15th or 16th century) and No. 629 (in Latin and Greek, of 14th to 15th century) and Vg <sup>C.S </sup>add the words: “In heaven, the Father, the Word and the holy spirit; and these three are one. <sup>8 </sup>And there are three witness bearers on earth.” But these words are omitted by אֹBASy<sup>most MSS. </sup>Vg<sup>many MSS. </sup>and the Latin New Testament according to the edition of St. Jerome, by Wordsworth and White, edition of 1911.</p>

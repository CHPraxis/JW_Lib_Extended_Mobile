<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark13"></a>INSIDE STALIN’S RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A multitude of &quot;excluiive” reports have been gathered and many book* have been written about conditions inside the &lt;J. B. S. R. Borne of these have presented the facts as they actually exist behind the &quot;iron curtain&quot;; while others, In an attempt to create propaganda and arouse hatred, have turned facts into fiction and hearsay rumors into known falsehoods. The material for the following article wai gathered by an &quot;Awake!” correipnndent in Turkey from a man who ha* Juit returned from Russia after having epent four yean there a* an officer in the German army and four additional years in Stalin’s slave labor camps. During those eight long years from 1041 to 194$ he was able to see with his own eyes what goes on Inside Russia today. The following story was gathered In an interview with this young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">B</span><span class="font13">ACK in the early stages of World War II, Mr B---had just finished</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">his college education. He had planned to he a lawyer, but no sooner did he graduate from school than he was inducted into Hitler's expanding war machine and sent into training as a tank operator. After some months of fighting in France he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and assigned to the eastern frontier, where German military intelligence planned an invasion of Russia and a blitz offensive aimed at Moscow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In June 1941 the break through began. Armored divisions and artillery units poured onto Russian soil and began their march northward, with troops of soldiers bringing up the rear. Mr. B----was in</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the elite Panzer tank outfit at the time and observed that they were making fast progress, often as many as forty miles a day, toward the capital, with little or no resistance from either the populace or Soviet troops. Often they paused to wait for their own foot soldiers, then on they rolled, hoping to capture the red-bricked Kremlin by autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Their blitz offensive was stopped short, however, just outside of Moscow itself. The Russians were well entrenched by this time and were able to stave off the advance of the Germans. As the weeks went by cold winter set in, with extreme frigid temperatures, which sometimes reached 50 degrees or more below zero. The Soviet troops were well equipped for fighting in such cold, hut the poorly dressed German soldiers were unable to continue their offensive. They soon learned that oil would freeze in such terrific cold, and their armored divisions could not move in the deep sw, Thou-sands lost their lives as the military strategists prepared to retreat without capturing their prized target.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Most of us are more or less familiar with the German retreat, the second and third offensives and the succeeding battles in Russia from the winter of 1941 to the end of the war. Finally, by May 1945, when most of Hitler's troops had returned to their former positions, and many were located in Czechoslovakia and other countries along the Russian border, it became plain that they would soon be captured either by the Anglo-French-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">American armiea from the west or by the Soviet army from the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mr. B---- relates that his general,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">who had around a million and a half man with their equipment in Czechoslovakia, flew to General Eisenhower, and there signed an agreement with him that at the time of capitulation all German troops would give themselves over to the Anglo-American forces rather than to the Russians. In the meantime, at the Yaita conference, it wan decided that Germany would he divided into zones, pending the setting up of a permanent German government later on. Thus in April ana May, when the Germans in the Eastern sector began giving themselves over t&lt;»- the Western forces, they were told that they would not be taken as prisoners of war but would he left in Eastern Germany, where the Russians could do with them as they wished. In this uncertain turn of events al. the time of official surrender millions of soldiers were taken (without equipment, which had been turned over to the Allies) by the Russian army as prisoners of </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">whl </span><span class="font13">In short order they were herded </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">into </span><span class="font13">trains and headed for Russia again, but this time as captives, wjth faint hope of ever seeing their homeland again.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>To Stalin^ Labor Camps</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Mr. B---* was taken to a small work</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">camp of about 2,500 prisoners. There they were told that they would engage in road building and construction work eight hours a day and that they would be well fed. But facts proved to the contrary when they were given three times daily a tiny piece of black bread and a thin soup made from boiled corn. Naturally their strength ebbed each day as the cruel guards forced them to toil on with pick and shovel. After a few months many began </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font13"> die from imdernourisb-ment and sickness resulting therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then came the cold, freezing winter months. But despite the frigid temperatures they were driven like beasts to work on. More died of fatigue and exposure. Some attempted to escape hut were always caught and brought back to solitary confinement, where they were given bread and water for a period of three months. It was a dull life indeed in which all hopes waned as they looked constantly at barbwire and guards with Tommy guns, This continued for an unbelievable four and one-half years of suffering and misery, during which time nearly half the prisoners died and were left in the snow and cold. It might be noted in passing that nearby was a women's slave labor camp which contained young girls from Spain. They,had been taken when small children by the coni-munists during the Spanish civil war years ago. They, too, had g/vew </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">up &amp;U </span><span class="font13">hopes of returning home.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>General Conditions</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> in</span><br><br><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>the Communist State</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;The Soviet state determines the behavior and activity of Soviet citizens in various ways. It educates Soviet people in a spirit of communist morality of the system </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">which introduces ti series of* </span><span class="font13">norms regulating the life of the population, imposing interdictions, establishing encouragements and naming punishment for the violation of these norms. The Soviet state stands guard over these legal norms with al] its power. The conduct and activity of the Soviet people are also determined by the force of public opinion, which is created by the activity of numerous public organizations. In creating public opinion the decisive role is played by the Communist party and the Soviet stale, which, through various media, formulates public opinion and educates the worker in a spirit of Socialistic awareness.” From issue No. 4 of Moscow </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bolshevik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From the above it can be seen that the state does the thinking for the people. In order to carry out the communist policy of suppression, secret police, known as the MVD, are brought into action. These</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">J. if</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">ak</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">E 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">are empowered to terrorize, and their methods are cold and cruel. Their first aim is to neutralize any political opposition by arresting (almost always at night) all suspects and sending them to labor camps* Execution is also a common means of destroying their opposers. If the &quot;crime” is a lesser one the accused may lose only his ration hook or job; but if the MVD think he knows something going on under cover, they may go to ah ends of torture to make him &quot;confess”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To assist the MVD police, &quot;informers” are placed among the populace to observe the movements of the people. Conversations are overheard and reported, suspects are shadowed to see where they go and whom they meet. Then, suddenly, without notice, arrests are made, and more are sent to w<sup>T</sup>ork in unpaid labor camps. This all tends to create a feeling of insecurity, as one may not know if his next-door ' neighbor is a secret police agent or an informer who will report his everv action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is estimated that not more than three percent of the inhabitants belong to the Communist party itself. Members are chosen from workers who have proved themselves willing tools of the Bolshevik program of nationalization and industrialization. They may be considered &quot;reactionaries” and not be admitted into the party if members of their families were officers, teachers, priests, etc., during or after.the revolution. Thus, despite Soviet propaganda to the contrary, class distinction does exist in the U.S.S.R., and daily the gap between the rich and the proletariat widens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Life, therefore, among the masses is a dreary one indeed. What with the suppression of human freedom by an all-powerful secret police on the one hand and the feeling of uncertainty which is created under such restraint on the other, the common people suffer yet more by a reduced level of monotonous inadequacy, which never sinks quite to the starvation point. The food distribution system is far from adequate, and at best the diet is slim and of no varietv. Ration books are given according to the civic category; thus party members, officers, teachers, etc., are granted sufficient food and clothing for comfortable living, while those of the masses are given less than required for a common worker. In one village there was no bread for a period of three months, and when one realizes that bread is the basic food, he can see the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Everywhere, both in lixedTprice stores and on the open market, food and clothing are expensive. As an example of the extremely high prices, in one village butter was selling at an equivalent of $4.00 a pound, eggs at from 30 to 40 cents each and meat from, $2.50 to $4.00 a pound. Fruit and vegetables are not so expensive when in season, but during the winter months even these commodities run into black-market prices.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Entertainment and Education</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Nobody laughs in public. Exceptions are at movies and theaters where capitalism is ridicujed and so-called &quot;foreign imperialism” is made light of. In fact, no entertainment exists which does not directly serve the advancement of the communist ideology. AH plays, movies and concerts are censored before running, in order that the people may see what the government intends to be shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The same is true in the schools. Teachers are chosen from among party members who are capable of instructing the children in Marxist doctrine. Books are supplied which exalt the communist state and advocate the socialist program. Thus, along with the regular school curriculum of history, science, etc., the youngsters are taught patriotism, physical fitness and preparedness for war. They are even given heart-to-heart talks teaching them that Jhere is no God, that all capitalist countries are determined to</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">overthrow the Soviet regime Bud that only Russia represents true democracy, justice and peace. Consequently, when a child is ten or twelve yea </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">th</span><span class="font13"> of age he is well-grounded in the communist doctrine.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Indus try and Agriculture</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Every form of business and labor is government cent rolled. Even the workers arc conscripted and sent wherever they are needed most. Military’ production is accented, and the usual policy is to make as many additional pieces as possible during the working period. In most of the factories the original owner? have been dispossessed. and directors chosen from the workers have been put in their places. These new factory' directors are ■subject to a political director, who gives the orders and Mis how many pieces each worker should produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In this regard it is interesting to learn about a Russian hero named Stakhanov, who introduced a new piecework system of increased production, lie was a coni miner who, in 1935. instituted ‘'brigades” of workers who were trained in a method of teamwork based on strict division of labor. These workers were able to produce much more rapidly than was possible when individuals worked alone, and in time their methods were applied in various forms to many branches of industry. This later became known as '■^takhanovism”, and today every laborer is expected to meet the high standard of production ect out by this policy. A worker who excel Is in this spirit of competition is often made director of the factory, to take the place of fl former on** who refused to take orders from his political superior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Out on the often-heard-of collective farms a similar pace of increased yield is demanded. Here the families live together in communal fashion and cooperate in tending the government-held lands. At ha r vesttime taxes musd be paid in kind, and sometimes the jieasanU are left with only about twenty percent of their produce with which to live on until the next year. Due to a lack of modern farm machinery<sup>7</sup> much work has to be done by laborious methode and long hours of work. It is said that on these community farms “it is impossible for the peasants either to live or die”. They are kept just above the starvation point by receiving an additional hog or sheep to tide them over until the next year</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Religion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Hostility toward religion is made clear in Marx’s much-quoted phrase, which de-seriltes it as the “opium for the people”. In the larger cities, though, like Mnwow, sonic churches arc permitted to remain open, and thus camouflage the fact that religion is nol free; for it is in these cities that foreign observers usually attend church, especially on holidays. Atheism is obligatory for all members of the Communist party, and they never at tend religious services, for fear of loosing their membership. Neither should teachers, government workers, soldiers, etc., be seen inside a church building, under threat of losing at least their ration book and perhaps even their position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although perhaps lately more tolerance is shown (award religion than in the days following the revolution, still worship openly is suppressed. No young clergyman may be officially ordained for the ministry’, although former priests who somehow escaped the terrible days of 1917 may still remain in their parishes which nrp open. According to Mr, B----</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">nearly every home contains some religious articles of worship, and many of the older people say prayers before these in private.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One experience will illustrate the attitude of the younger generation toward participation in, religious worship: A girl told how her poor mother prayed each day tn the &quot;virgin” and God, while she never made a prayer but went to the movie? with her fiance, a young commissar. Her mother, she added, was poor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">hungry and ill clad, while she was wealthy, well dressed and even had chocolates, considered a delicacy in Russia. By this she intended to show that God is nonexistent or unable to answer prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the rural sections practically all churches have been closed to public worship, Many near the collective farms have been turned into garages for farm machinery, others have been converted into storage bins for grain, while the larger and nicer buildings in the villages have been made into </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">schools and</span><span class="font13"> museums. Mr. B---- visited one such mu</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">seum and, among other things, observed an exhibit showing the various stages of the human embryo during pregnancy. At the last picture was an inscription, roading: &quot;From all the foregoing it can be realized that only the man and the woman give life to the baby and that God has nothing to do with producing it as has commonly been believed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Marriages are not performed in the church. The bride and groom must be wed by an official of the state, who first checks their registration card to see that they are not &quot;reactionaries”. If they are &quot;clear”, then a ruhber stamp does the trick, and they become husband and wife. Divorces, though, are harder to obtain, despite the fact that families are often separated from one another under the work conscription law.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Return Home at Last</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">One day a few months ago Mr, B——■ was going about his usual </span><a href="http://ta.sk"><span class="font13">task </span></a><span class="font13">in the prison ward when word came that all the prisoners were to assemble for routine inspection. Nobody dared hope that he would get to return home, and no one knew that Eastern German politicians had asked Russia to send hack prisoners of war whose homes were in the Eastern zone under communist indue neo, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font13"> that propaganda could be made of this move. In the examination many were rejected, but some were accepted to be removed from the camp. Mr. B—- was among those few who were told to pack their clothes- Up .to this moment they thought that they&lt;would be transferred to another camp nearby, but when they were put on a train they began to suspect that it might take them across the border toward their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">All along the way everyone was quiet and calm. It was like a funeral for its solemnity. At the border Russian guards came through and ordered several of the men off before the train started again on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">its journey. This happened again and </span><span class="font13">again as they passed through other countries under communist influence, until many of their number had been taken from the coaches. Mr. B— estimates that only about a thousand of his group finally ‘Tossed the border into Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At <sup>7</sup> ist they reached Berlin! What a difference from a few years before! When released by the Russian authorities, many began searching for their homes destroyed in the bombing raids or for their families who were either dead or scattered here and there. It is reported that most of the ex-prisoners managed to get into the Western zone, now under a new German government. That, at least, is what Mr. B----did. There the Amer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ican officials questioned him as to what he saw and where the prison camps are located, etc. From there he was granted an entry visa to Turkey and made the trip to Istanbul, where he told the above things to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> correspondent. It was a happy ending to a cruel, trying and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">hopeless experience under both the Ger-</span><span class="font13">111 an and Russian &quot;masters”. His health is poor and the memories of the past still flash before him like a film on the screen, hut little by little he is adapting himself to a new.way of life after nine long years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The fact is that millions of prisoners are still heing held in the U.S.S.R., where it is a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">crime to worship</span><span class="font13"> God </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">and to s&amp;y </span><span class="font13">No to the state. The communist press hailed the release of these few prisoners as a &quot;generous gesture”. But this is another dodge or trick to further confuse the complex conditionB in countries under Stalin's control. It is typical of Lenin’s description of how communists must, triumph : “We have to use any ruse, dodge, trick, cunning, unlawful methods, concealment and veiling of the truth . . . As long as capitalism and socialism exist, we caniiiii live in peace; in the cud one or the other will triumph-—u fdneral dirge will he.sung over the Soviet republic or over world capitalism . , * but until this takes place the principal role is to dodge and maneuver.” Certainly they plan to continue their triei^, veiling of the truth and n nine livers, because reports show that they have a strong army and are continually increasing their military strength. Their uniforms* their equipment ana precision can hardly be equaled, according to most authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Without doubt Stall r/s Russia is one of the kingdoms mentioned in Daniel's prophecy* which, along with the other ■ wicked nations of the earth, will be utterly destroyed at the battle of A rmaged-don. The account in chapter 2, verse 44, reads; “And in the days of those kings shall the God of Inytven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be loft to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it. shall stand for ever/' </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Am.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!” correspondent In Dominican Republic</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">T WAS a pleasant day in December, warm, sunny, and the parks were full of flowers. Leon Glass and his American friend Jeremiah Stolfi were contented with their lot ip life as they walked down Conde street in Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic. They had problems, but they had freedom to do the thing they most liked to do, that is, talk to the people about their belief in the Bible and about the promises of a bettor world to come that they found in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As they'passed the place of Leon’s employment, in the new modernistic building that housed the National Lottery, Leon said, &quot;Let's go in and weigh ourselves on the penny scale.” What a shock they both got when the doorman said, “I have orders to not let Leon Glass or Francisco Madera enter this building.” ’‘But why?” Leon asked. &quot;You’re not employed here anymore, and my orders are to not let you enter this building,” responded the doorman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here was another link in the chain of events that were to follow. A day before the scene at the door of the Lottery, a telegram to the president of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo, was circulated in the office where Leon and Francisco worked, extolling the president for his declaration against all aggressors of this country. The signers also stated that they would be faithful to the present regime and that they would recognize no Bible but Trujillo’s. Leon and Francisco couldn’t sign allegiance to any man or rule of man, because they<sup>r</sup> would have to break the agreement they had made with God to put Him-first, recognizing Him as their savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yes, they lost their relatively well-paying jobs, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">a few<sup>7</sup> days later they<sup>7</sup> got their call for military service in the army. These calls for military<sup>7</sup>. service, according to law, are to be made by lof. Under military service laws provision is made for exemptions. These exemptions are undefined, but generally mean crippled or sick subjects. The two witnesses made application for exemption to President Trujillo, because they w<sup>7</sup>ere ministers devoting their time and energy to gospel-preaching. In their application for exemption they presented testimonials and other proofs of theif ministry. All papers were sent to the president by way of the military<sup>7</sup> office and sent certified wdth return receipt requested. The army colonel said the letter was forwarded to the president from his office, but no return receipt w<sup>7</sup>as ever received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Casting Crooked Lot</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few<sup>7</sup> days later al] who had signed the letters and testimonials received calls for military service. Maybe one could say<sup>7</sup> that it was just chance that all these persons who had interest in the Bible educational work of Jehovah’s witnesses were called, but when two American citizens also were called in the lottery it gave the whole thing an odor of planned opposition. When asked how it was that the names of Americans came up in the Dominican.lottery for military<sup>7</sup> service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the officer said, * Such questions shouldn't be asked&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Unusual, you might say, for a republic that is seeking tn demonstrate its kindness and liberty to a United Nations investigating committee who are wondering why there is so much unrest in the Caribbean area. But wait. The day arrives for the men (four now) to accept military training. They report to the of flee and are immediately put in the army fort prison. That was Monday, January 2. The law says that for failure to train the penalty is five days in prison for each day of failure. The five days pass, and still the four are in prison without charge or hearing. Sunday comes. This is visiting day ai prison, so about fifty friends of the witnesses go down to the fort to visit them. Instead of permitting the fifty </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to enter at one</span><span class="font13"> time and visit the two hours that are allotted each Sunday for visiting, small groups of eight or ten are permitted to visit only ten or fifteen minutes, and then another group comes in. The visits are in a special room, and all who visit those boys must give their cedufa numbers and names. In this way all who had sympathies with the boys were identified. Needless to say, all men who visited the boys were also called for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After visiting day Sunday, comes Monday, with the witnesses still in prison; then Tuesday morning a guard says to the men, “You can go home&quot; They spend one night at home, and the next day the guards come looking for them, and to prison they go again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In » few days a semblance of legal justice crops up. Rumor has it that they are to have a trial. One day before the trial comes instruction that they ready themselves for the trial. They put on clean clothes and are taken to the Palace of Justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the courtroom there are about a hundred people, mostly witnesses, who are assembled there to hear the trial. They are accused by the court of refus-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ing military service. Their defense is that they otey God when laws of man conflict with God’s laws, and since they are citizens of this republic whose slogan is “God, Country and Liberty” they arc do ing just that, obeying God first. They also make the point that the jmeahJanJ hasn't denied them exemption nor has he given them the exemption that they asked for. After a hearing of about fifty minutes the court recesses. Next day Dominican justice decrees that God must bow to military service and fixes a penalty of eighteen months in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">prison at</span><span class="font13"> pyblie work Appeal is made to u higher court, and the witnesses go back to prison tn labor for the state.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Campaign Against Witnesses Widespread</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Events are happening in other parts of the country too. San Francisw de 21a-coris (10,000 population) was just recently opened up to Watchtower missionaries and their Bible educational work. They (four girls) met up with Catholic opposition. Teen-agers pestered the girls with a song whose theme was 'get out yon </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Protestants,</span><span class="font13"> we are Cathodes'. The Kingdom Hall sign was torn down. Pcat-erers got bolder and threw stones and sticks, making educational missionary' work more difficult in certain parts of the town, and this in spite of a very much respected police force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Santiago (50,000 population) has its downtown streets littered by thousands of big handbills, 10 by 12 inches, downing th? </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazines, warning Catholics to have nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses, and ending up with, “Long live the virgin of High Grace&quot; (patron saint of the Dominican Republic). The “Gentlemen of High Grace&quot; sign the handbill; but evidently it’s not so 'gentlemanly* to put the handbills into the hands of the people, because ruffians, beggars and rough kids of , the street put them out, and many of these, when informed by the witnesses of the nature of the handbill, refuse to,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">put more out, A few weeks iaier another one appears linking </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!</span><span class="font9"> and Jehovah’s witnesses with communism. This one is signed by the “Youths of High Grace”. The military service call puts a witness in prison for two years in Santiago. Almost all who had been studying with witnesses were called down to the army fort and warned not to have anything to do with this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In San Cristobal (3,000 population), birthplace of the reigning president, one of Jehovah’s witnesses is a businessman, a pharmacist. He has Bible studies in his home pharmacy. One night someone tore down the Kingdom Hall sign from the house front. Police came the next day with a warning to quit his preaching activities or sutler the consequence of mob action. Mob action by citizens in this so-called republic is as rare as it was in Germany under Hitler. The threats have failed to accomplish their purpose, because Luis, the witness, continues his preaching work. Gasoline is rationed here in this country, and Luis recently bought a car and got gas to operate it; but this campaign against Jehovah's witnesses started, so, when he applied for gasoline, he got the tickets one day and the next day a policeman came around and took them away. His authority wrns from the head of the rationing setup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the next thing was the call for military service. Although Luis is over 40 years old, he v’as called. The law says that only in time of war are men between the ages of 35 and 55 to be called for service in the armed forces, but now is a time of peace. This service is for two hours the first Sunday of each month. His callletter added, “And your failure to report will be considered an act of rebellion and will mean your internment in a military camp.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At his failure to report for conscientious reasons he was put in the army fort and spent one night there. The next day influential friends made up bail and he got out. No time has heen fixed for the jifnv </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">trial. Six others who had been studying with Jehovah’s witnesses were called for military service, too. All lost their secular employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Get” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Back to the capital, Ciudad Trujillo. Here the campaign has continued and has been far reaching. Now six witnesses are in prison. Exemption applications are still unanswered by the “benevolent benefactor” of the Dominican Republic. Several women have lost their jobs because they are Jehovah’s witnesses. People who stop to talk with the witnesses on the street are later warned to steer clear of them. Anyone who studies the Bible with one of Jehovah’s witnesses will shortly thereafter get a visit from a policeman or plain-clothes man with the familiar warning. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some have frankly been told that there is a campaign on to &quot;get” the witnesses. The witnesses are followed and shadowed wherever they go. Everything they do and say gets to the officials in power. Fear hangs over the people like a hateladen cloud. Each day brings news of more tightening down on Jehovah’s witnesses. The men .in prison are denied food from their families. A newspaper article in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span><span class="font9"> slandered the witnesses, saying they are communists. All manner of lies were published in the halfpage article. When the editor was confronted with the facts about the Watch Tower Society and their work, he didn't even try to defend his article but just talked about fulfilling laws. He knew he had no grounds for the .statements about Jehovah's witnesses’ being communists. He promised to print the letter, but that same night’s paper carried another slanderous article attacking the witnesses, and the explanatory letter was never published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consular and embassy officials of the American government, refuse to bring to light the truth about the false accusations against the American corporation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and justify themselves with the statement that 'the situation here with Trujillo is very shaky already and they don't want to make it worse’. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Through it all the witnesses have gone ahead with the preaching work and many good persons see the need of righteousness more than ever before and know that only God can bring in a just government. So they continue to pray, &quot;Your kingdom come.” Jehovah’s witnesses know that there are still many good people who need to hear the Kingdom message, and by God’s grace they will hear, it. The witnesses are not radicals seeking to change governments, they only want freedom to carry on their Bible educational work to the Lord’s honor and for the benefit, of righteous men. Rulers and governors might think that by sub-jectingthemselves </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9"> and placating Catholic priests and cardinals, benefits will accrue to them both spiritually and materially; but let'them look at modern history. What benefits resulted to Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">')&gt;--&lt;&lt; </span><span class="font9">even if he did have a concordat with the pope? What benefit resulted from the pope’s blessings ! What benefits did Mussolini get from the pope’s blessings? Shot, kicked and spat </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">upon. Franco</span><span class="font9"> has the pope’s blessings, and what’s the condition in Spain? Peace and prosperity! The opposite. Regularly the boat “Ma-gallenes” brings over about 700 refugees from Spain. Some get off here, others go on to Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba. Ask these refugees about Spain. They have told me that in the cities the people live, not from scarce rationed goods, but from the black market. Priests rule hand in hand with the police, but is their rule blessed with peace and satisfaction? Anywhere that Catholicism dominates, people suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is this campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses in this country a foretaste of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the kind of</span><span class="font9"> an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">invitation that the</span><span class="font9"> pope tendered to Protestants who have 'strayed from the Catholic fold’! What a way to persuade wandering sheep!—and in a “holy year” too! -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bloody Mary’s Mercy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is taken from the February, 1947, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Digest</span><span class="font6"> article entitled “Death Under Two Queens”: “The sufferings of the Protestant victims of Catholic persecution in England, 1555 to 1558, under Queen Mary, have been realistically described by John Foxe, whose </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Martyrs,</span><span class="font6"> held in high esteem in Protestant England, has been for many years and is'still an arsenal for weapons against the Catholic Church, John Foxe is responsible for Mary Tudor's name having become a household word in England for all that is vile and cruel: Bloody Mary, the wretched queen, and so on, , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“There</span><span class="font6"> is, however, one notable feature in the burnings of Smithfield, which has escaped the notice of Foxe and of subsequent Protestant writcrH. Those who were responsible for the burning of Protestants at the stake, whether it was Mary or her ministers, were not coldblooded, flinthearted fiends, who were bent on getting every ounce of physical suffering out of their victims. In fact, they concerted measures to shorten and lessen their pains. Death at the stake was not thereby made pleasant; hut it was not an intentional exhibition of barbarous cruelty,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ (’•“It was officially permitted that those who were condemned to death at the stake should have a small bag of gunpowder before their breasts, which exploded at the first contact of the fire, and either caused speedy death or rendered the victims unconscious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■(.' Of course, it took a little time for the flames to elinib from the feet to Mary’s bag of mercy and blow a hole in the breast. Frequently a Bible instead nf gunpowder was hung around the victim’s neck, and his children were forced to put the torch to the fagots.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">T IS a pity that the Virgin Islands are not better known, particularly in Britain and the United States, since these islands cost the taxpayers of the United States much money and Britain much blood. Most people, however, have just a vague idea as to where they are, “down in the Caribbean somewhere.’' If you are interested, on the map run your eye to the east of Puerto Rico and you will see the small group of islands marked there. They consist of St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix, Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, Peter Island, Anagada and some lesser keys and rocks. The first three mentioned belong to the United States, bought from the Bancs in 1916 for $25,000,000. The remainder are claimed by England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AU of the islands except Anagada were visited by the missionary yacht “Sibia”. Anagada is a coral island surrounded by shallow uncharted waters, so it was decided by the crew of “Sibia” to pass it by for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is really hard to describe the islands, their shape and terrain, but if you were to take a wool rug and push it together from all sides the result might well represent what the Virgin Islands look like from the sea. Great ravines ripping the sides of the mountains, large saucerlike indentations, all verdant and lush with tropic growth and wild flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The average tourist will see merely the outside, and will go home with an</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JfAY </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">impression of sights and things prepared for such as he. But let him climb the donkey trails that wind back into the hills and he will meet the true islander— a sincere, kind, polite and soft-spoken person far different from those who loaf around the waterfronts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few yachtsmen and others visit the islands, most of them in the winter season. True, it is quite warm during these months, hut it is*hot too hot in the summer and the visitor then has more advantages: tropical fruits that grow in abundance, especially on Tortola, calm seas and delightful sea bathing on the most beautiful beaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the winter months these same beaches are pounded by the heavy seas rolling in off the gale-swept Atlantic. The sand is washed up in big ridges and banks, the bare rocks revealed underneath. However, the sight of the great waves curling and dashing their mighty weight against the Hack rocks, worn smooth by many years of such treatment, is really worth seeing. One can fix his eye on a great roller away off from shore and watch it coming in, a majestic, powerful rich-blue mass of water which seems to gather speed and turn from Hue to pale-green as it nears the shore. It begins to crest and the colors of the rainbow form over its head. Jt curls back like the arched neck of a prancing horse and races with quickening speed, leaving a frothy wake behind until it crashes on the heach and rushes wildly among the stones as if seeking every lit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font9">tic moving thing to suck back into its boiling surge. All the while the air is full of sound and salty mist-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the summer these same beaches are covered with fine, level sand as the more peaceful waters gradually undermine the great ridges and smooth them down. It is then that one can lie under the broad-leafed shade of the sea-grape trees while little tropic waves whisper softly along the shore and wash soothingly over his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The inevitable argument against summer cruising </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font9"> the Virgin Islands will usually be the possibility of a hurricane. Naturally, the hurricanes are something to be concerned about, hut in these modern days of radio and radio-telephone the yachtsman will be comparatively safe. San Juan broadcasts the weather conditions twice daily and usually gives sufficient warning so that any yachtsman may get his boat to a s^fe place. In some places “Sibia”, with her nine-foot draft, was able to draw close to the shore and tie fast to the mangrove trees and be perfectly safe even in the roughest weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Coral Bay, off the island of St. John, has several little inlets with deep water where a boat may seek shelter from the wind in any direction and really have nothing to worry about. The wind will rush down the mountain sides with terrific force, but it can merely ripple the water. There are other good “hurricane holes” at Tortola, Virgin Gord a, Jost Van Dyke, while boats of shallower draft might find many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">People of the Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The common people of the islands claim to be quite religious, but they always manage to find some excuse for their many irregularities, especially in matters of sex. It is not considered a shameful thing for a man to have more than one wife or for a woman to be “kept” by more than one man and have children by them. In defense of the custom one man said: “Well, God know de weaknesses of he people.&quot; Another person, speaking rather derogatively of the local church, was asked, &quot;Then why do you go'?” To which she replied rather </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">indignantly: &quot;Well, dat’s de only so&amp;al-</span><span class="font9">ized life we gits.” Most of the homes have only two rooms, and incredibly large families manage to live in them, which perhaps is the answer to their easy way of life. Quite often an introduction by a proud mother to her children will be : &quot;Dis one an’ dat one mine, but dis one he my husband’s by de nex’ woman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The men make better sailors than farmers and are entirely without fear of the sea, storm or no storm, and their fearlessness has been the cause of many a family anxiously waiting for a father or brother that did not return. They handle their boats with a skill that is really surprising, considering the usually poor material they have to work with. Many times our hearts have gone out in pity for them as we have watched their weather-beaten craft set out for some distant island, men, women and children all carefree and happy, while aloft the mass of rotten patches called a sail looks ready to be carried away at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no encouragement for the people on the farms, as there is no market for all they*can produce. The British islands are unfairly taxed on produce leaving the islands and on whatever they buy with the money thus gained and brought back home. An old woman told us that she had to pay twenty-five cents tax on her little old grass hut, while the commissioner had recently been granted twenty-four thousand dollars from the government to renovate his mansion, and the people were organizing a march of protest on the commissioner’s house and were petitioning the United States to be annexed by them, hoping to thus better their conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems that if the people were taught what to grow and how to grow it and had a market created for their goods, there</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">would be no reason at all why there could not be a steady crop of different things coining in all year round. As it is, the Spirit of most of the people is dead; they have little or no initiative or living standards, and could not have, as there is no means of giving scope to such standards except for a very few who control the politics and business of the islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The crew of “Sihia” bought avocado pears much larger than any we had seen in the States. There w<sup>T</sup>as hardly a day when one or the other of the crew did not bring in some kind of fruit or vegetable, more than we could easily eat. Sometimes our cockpit looked like a fruit stand. We have had coconuts, mangoes, mammees, limes, pears, guavas, sapodillas, bananas, soursops, sugar apples, breadfruit, pomegranates and . several other small but tasty fruits. Quite often friendly people would place a basket of various fruits on the deck as a gift and, poor as they were, would refuse money for it. “Sibia’s”crew were usually able to catch all the fish they needed by trolling when mdving from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The main food of the common people seems to be corn meal and fish if they live near the sea and rice and peas if they live up in the hills. The cooking is all done outside of the main house, in a shed of sorts or on the ground just outside the house. The “stove”, three stones around a wood fire with a margarine can for a pot in some cases; others have iron charcoal burners and iron pots. Few of the houses have tables, and the eating is all done with the family sitting on boxes with food in their laps or just sitting on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the better houses are made of concrete blocks of rather sandy-looking composition. There are frame houses of poor and unpainted lumber with no glass in the space for windows. A “trash house” is a house made of interlaced sticks and filled with mud, homemade lime or merely covered with bunches of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">31</span><span class="font9">.41' </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">grass to shed the water. Inside, of course, there is a dirt floor, and, quite often, after such a house has been occupied for a considerable space of time, it will be noticed that the floor under the more or less permanent articles of furniture such as beds or trunks will be inches higher than the rest of the floor. This is caused by constant sweeping around such objects and in time leaving them marooned several inches higher than the main level of the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scenic Beauty</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are miles of trails for horseback riding and some good horses too. Some of these trails will take the rider right along the shore and wind around up over the hills, where every turn brings another delightful view. Trails where tropical trees meet overhead and tropic flowers make the air heavy with their fragrance. Tortola offers the most scenic rides; it is more lush and far better cultivated, Following the trails that rim the steep valleys, one will come to Brewers Bay, Looked down upon from high in the hills it looks like a fairy-story place or a dream of paradise, while the noise of the snowy surf spreading its lacy pattern over the sand floats up the verdant hills to strike the ear like the sound of a sigh, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just around the point another beautiful sight is afforded by Cane Garden Bay, Viewed from the wind-swept heights of Sage mountain it looks a picture of peace, marked here and there with grass huts and more or less modern homes, lazy coconut palms leaning at every angle and hr oad-leafed banana trees, unmistakable even at a distance. Here and there splashes of red from the brilliant blossom of the indescribable poinciana tree. Winding one’s way down the long narrow trail, w<sup>r</sup>hich in time of rain is a watercourse draining the mountain slopes, he finds himself suddenly in the village with polite soft-spoken p^ple beside themselves with curiosity. Many of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">them have never been off their little island, and one cannot help but admit that perhaps they are better for it</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Space does not permit to describe all of the beautiful sights open to the traveler desiring such. It is hard to imagine that there are work, strife, evil deeds and godlessness in the world as one bathes in the cool waters of the islands while the rising sun casts its misty beams up the deep valleys, discovering to the eye with shadows every little ravine while crowning the hills with light. Or, during the heat of the day with the sea breeze for cooling, watch the great bosom of the ocean heaving gently, powerfully, a million ripples with a diamond in each, backed by the richest blue and little cresting waves appearing in all directions like frisking lambs in some great meadow, And, when the cool loveliness of nights starry shade smooths the faces of the rugged hills while the soft night air wafts to one's ears the continuous sigh of the sea, there should be assurance for the most stony heart that there is a God who formed this earth to be inhabited by faithful people forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As for music in the islands, there is none that is peculiar to the people, but it all contains the same pathos as much of the other music of this “advanced age”. But there is music, music that steals through every nerve of the body and takes possession of every fiber, cleanses the humble heart of doubts and speaks a language of praise of the great Creator. It is there waiting to be written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Melodies from the scented air of the rich lush valleys, rhapsodies and lilting songs from the dancing waves and the wild waving palms on the shore, brilliant cadenzas from the trilling birds that live among the whispering leaves of the forest, soft and soothing Cargoes from the sloops that lay becalmed with hardly a movement, while stars from their ebon settings mark bright 'trails across the sea. There is music in the mighty billow heaving its rolling mass up the sloping Shores to clatter among the stones and ripple back </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to its yeasty</span><span class="font13"> swell. Yes, there is music in the islands just waiting to be set down in notes of sunshine between bars of moonlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The people, however, are not happy; they have a keen sense of the wrongs committed against them, real and fancied. They seem </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font13"> have the idea </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">that no </span><span class="font13">one but they suffer the pangs of poverty or the effects of a commercialized world gone top-heavy, though some are now beginning to see that they suffer as a few among many the world over; and by the pur^ message of truth these are being, weaned from the bitterness that floods their hearts. They have learned of the great battle of Armageddon, which will destroy all injustices and usher in the glorious reign of Christ, who will right all wrongs and fill every worthy heart with joy. Many have become convinced from the Scriptures that their little islands will be a paradise indeed along with the rest of the world under the new world government of Christ, soon to take the place of the present rule of foolish, ungodly, boastful men,</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font9">AN has been acquiring knowledge and accumulating information for nearly six thousand years. A great deal of this has been recorded and is now housed in the modern libraries. Nevertheless,comparatively few* people avail themselves of this information or take advantage of this vast wealth of material. For this reason the read</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">er's attention is drawn to the generally unsuspected value of library content, and to some of the ways this material can be utilized. Even though it is usually frequented by fiction-lovers, no age or sex excepted, nevertheless, the sober student can pan serioUs gold from the streams that flow<sup>7</sup> from these musty mountains of lore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The student, once be has grasped the key to library* use, need never be discouraged by the vastness of material. He will soon learn to reach gold strata as unerringly as the bird finds its nest in the expansive forest. He will come to locate the matter in quest with little more effort than finding a particular word in. a dictionary of half a million, because libraries are astonishingly well organized for systematic research. Banish before starting the thought that “You can’t learn it out of books”, for this is a psychological barrier to investigation, a relic of ignorance, an epithet of the Inquisition. Today proved shallower than objections to electricity as a work saver, even this fallacy should be buried by the grave digger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The worried brows encountered generally indicate that most people have a problem. It will not be guaranteed, but the library may have the answer. Workers in industry can often find the answer jtfyiy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">!&gt;2, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">to technical problems. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Official Gazette</span><span class="font9"> of the United States patent office, with copious drawings and descriptions, is there on the shelves, and may be referred to to keep one postfed on latest developments. A home owner can put the library to work for himself, learning how to make a thousand household repairs or how to build a driveway. For the housewife there is just as much library information. There are books on every type of cooking and canning, more than you can afford to buy for your own. If you wish to redecorate your house, match colors properly, or if you are buying a lot or building a house or are interested in landscaping, there is a book in the library telling all about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are books on simplified law, telling of the liabilities and rights of citizens, information that may save you hundreds of dollars. Renters, tenants, proprietors, saleswomen and citizens in general can all find useful bits of remunerative knowledge there. Want to learn Latin or logic? Go to the library. Want to know something about birds or butterflies ? Get a book at the library on the subject. Want a name for your expected baby? There is a book at the library containing thousands of names, together with their meanings. In fact, there is no part of human activity or endeavor that</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the libraries do not touch upon. If you can read you can learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Without making an exhaustive scan'll to support, it ia hazarded that every subject covered by college, school, or correspondence course is also covered by material in the metropolitan libraries. Tt stands </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Io</span><span class="font13"> reason, then, that libraries are the most practical xml least expensive way to learn a vast number of things, or to improve present knowledge, It is at least worthwhile to eheck what your local library has to offer before buying expensive instruction. Of course, school diplomas may have commercial value, as accredited graduates acquire standing by virtue thereof, but no school or college has a monopoly on information nor exclusive possession of vital knowledge. Facts about important discoveries usually get around, even about such closely held serrels as the hydrogen bomh, it is now averred. Because it is free, no commercial concern profits by advertising the library. Though modest and unsung, the library rewards rourlshjp.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>How to Use the Catalogue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">The catalogue or curd reference or card index tcllfl what books the library contains. Most libraries list books by title, by author and by subject, and these are listed alphabetically on cards. It is just as easy to use this indexing device as it is an encyclopedia. The drawers con’ turning the cards are arranged in alphabetic order, just like the volumes of an encyclopedia, A to Z. To illustrate by example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Nearly everybody is interested in the subject of “writing”, in the sense of literary composition; so look this word up. Now since &quot;writing’<sup>7</sup> may include hand writing” as well as the art of putting letters on paper, no doubt the card will refer yon to more specific subjects like “chirography” (the art, style and character of handwriting), '‘penmanship/’ ‘handwriting,” and possibly such additional subjects as &quot;composition&quot;, “poetry/ &quot;prose/ “rhetoric,” etc. Under each of these subjects there are cards describing each individual book, or, in the case of &amp;&nbsp;set of books, a single title for the set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">. Jot down the call numbers of the par-ticul«r bonks you are most interested in, and then let the librarian direct you to where the books arc located in the stacks or shelves, if this is permitted. There on the shelf you* will perhaps find other hooks of a similar nature. To tell whether the book is one that you are particularly interested in, read the foreword, chapter headings and the conclusion of each chapter. Oftentimes books conclude their chapters with an epitome.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Periodicals and Other Services</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Besides the vast storehouse of knowledge contained between the covers of books, additional information is available in magazines and periodicals These often contain the latest information on discoveries, the newest finds or occurrences, some of the finest estimates, evaluations and epitomes, often written in u on technical language. Their limited space and variety of renders force magazines Io oom press vital data into few words, trim details, and give busy people a condensed report on the subject</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To make this tremendous quantity of information available a cumulative index of all articles on all subjects, published in (nore than 125 magazines, is available in the library. This very valuable index is called </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Header's Guide to-Periodical Literature,</span><span class="font13"> and it goes back to the year 18EXX Many libraries also have another similar index called the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">International Inder to Periodicals,</span><span class="font13"> which indexes about 300 piihlieationw, covering such fields of knowledge as science, history, philology and literature, political science, education, religion, art archaeology, sociology, economics, law, etc. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Book Heviem Digest</span><span class="font13"> has been published for the last forty-five years. A weekly world neww digest, together with its cumulative in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">uex, is called </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Facts on File.</span><span class="font9"> It is another helpful ai&lt;l to locating facts, figures and information of world interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Besides these reference aids there are many other facilities that the seeker of information will find of help in the library, You want to know wlw’s who in any particular field? Well, chances are you can find out in the library. There one will find large books giving the latest information on who’s who is the world, in America, in the various states, in the practice of law, in labor, in engineering, in philosophy, in science, in sports, and in many other pursuits of activity. Go to the library if you want to use encyclopedias, dictionaries, concordances and other exhaustive reference works; for, besides those dealing with knowledge in general, there are many of a specialized nature—concordances to poetry, concordances to Tennyson, concordances to Shakespeare, concordances to the Bible, cyclopedias on religion, cyclopedias of practical and familiar quotations, dictionaries of foreign phrases, maxims, proverbs, covering ancient and modern, classic and popular literature, and books on days, dates and events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Librarians are usually intelligent and helpful people. If you outline the subject you wish to investigate, department officials frequently give valuable help and advice. It is seldom that what you seek to know has not also been sought by another. Librarians are quick to put their fingers on yearbooks, government publications, cross-references and other helpful sources of information that you might overlook, Their business is not so much to know everything as it is to know where to go to find the information desired, and they are more competent at this job than is generally accredited to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In accepting the invitation to use the library, be sure to observe the simple rules of library etiquette. Do not- take satchels or brief cases into reading rooms, for these are not allowed; an obvious rule to prevent thievery. Loud talking is not permitted. Marking or damaging books in any way is a misdemeanor, and inexcusable. Be considerate of others who also use the library. Be friendly and polite to the librarian if you want his full cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no.doubt as to the importance of books and libraries in preserving and disseminating information from one generation to another. If recorded knowledge of the most important human necessity, life itself, was entrusted to that 66-book library known as the Bible, and considered as an adequate means by Jehovah God to impart to man knowledge and instruction for salvation, then all lesser information can also be transmitted by this same medium. The Bible library must be used to gain its benefits. The same is true with other libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Science in Ancient Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more the archaeologists and scientists learn the more confirmation accumulates for the Bible account. Digging in the Mesopotamian valley, archaeologists are amazed, the farther down they dig, at the suddenness with which civilization of a high order bursts into view. Men then were skilled in the use of tools, in smelting metals, in architecture, in the fine arts, and in writing. Their knowledge of engineering and mathematics is amazing to the evolutiou-minded scientists. The Sumerians of 2000 B.C. had in school’ “textbooks” knowledge that astounded the archaeologists, and on these discoveries the New York Times, January 8, 1950, said: “There is evidence that clay ‘textbooks’ of the schoolboys of Shadip-pur contain an encyclopedic outline of the scientific knowledge of their time, which will necessitate a sharp revision of the history of the development of science and, accordingly, of the story of the development of the human mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1950</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19</span></p><img src="g_E_19500522_files/g_E_19500522-6.png" alt="" style="width:690pt;height:940pt;">
<p><span class="font9">the youngsters, including a wading pool and Central Park’s famous Carousel, Veering off to the right we stroll past the Pond, a natural lagoon decorated with wild fowls, pelicans, swans, etc., in the summer, and colorfully clad ice-skaters in the winter. The Shetland pony track comes next and then the Zoo. Here outdoor cages and well-constructed buildings house a variety of wildlife from the world over, ranging from sea lions to monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">North of the Zoo behold the shaded beauty of the Mall! The Mall cuts a diagonal line due north across the park’s rectangle and offers a delightful promenade beneath the sheltering branches of graceful trees rustling melodiously in the breeze. At the north end is the Concert Ground, the scene of open-air concerts, folk dances and similar exhibitions held on the warm summer nights,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Mall terminates in a flight of broad steps leading through an arched underpass to a terrace that extends to the Lake. Over there, across the Lake, is the Ramble. With its worn stone, wooded hillside, the distant sound of oars in their locks and the flapping wings of waterfowl, the Ramble succeeds more than any other retreat in the park in taking the city d’Weller out of his noisy New York. If we follow the pathway to the left we will wend our way over the Ramble, through deep gorges, past hanks of rhododendrons and azaleas, while another path leads to a house where boats can he rented for boating on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But we will continue to strike a northerly course and begin to climb yon hill. Suddenly, as if stepping out of this twentieth century into the Middle Ages, we stand before what appears to be a medieval castle. No miracle this, just the Belvedere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">j/.4? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">22, 1950</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And while it resembles an old castle, it houses a mos,t up-to-date United States weather station with its complicated instruments for prognosticating the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Attractions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We take advantage of the Belvedere as a keen vantage point from w<sup>r</sup>hich to view other places of interest in the park. In the immediate foreground is pretty little New Lake, and beyond is the sprawling green of the Great Lawn and the billion-gallon reservoir, which provides New<sup>T</sup> York with much of its water. To the left, Shakespeare Garden, with many of the flowers and shrubs mentioned in the poet’s works; and over to the right is the 200-ton granite obelisk, complete with hieroglyphics, quarried by Thothmes III in 1600 B.C., and brought to the United 'States A.D., 1880. Onr brief tour of Central Park concludes as we meander down the paths of the Conservatory Garden, amid beds of hardy American flowers and rows of crabapple trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Innumerable features elude us—bird sanctuaries, relics of the War of 1812, wisteria-covered arbors, hidden paths where the metalie noise of the city is replaced by the song of nature, horse-drawm carriages of yesteryear and their stovepipe-hatted drivers and numeroup playgrounds bordering the park. We can understand when we hear it said that</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Rivaling Central Park in the affections of Mr. New Yorker is Bronx Park—700 acres of forest and rugged green, Herr we can find silence delightfully broken by the splash of email waterfalls and the song of birds, while warm sunbeams filter through spreading hemlocks, oaks and sassafras. Giant ridges from nurlli to south, ground out by glacial action, cast a of I he primeval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The site of Bronx Park was acquired in 1884 and in now the home of the New York Zoological Park, largest in America. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">boo</span><span class="font13"> contains some 2,600 specimens (1,000 species}, and was established for the purpose of having a vivarium which would make “captive animals not only comfortable, but really happy&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Through the gate, down a short flight of steps and wo enter the park to sec, first of all, the hoofed-animal ranges: twenty acres nf laud for American bison, and a ridge of pink granite for wild sheep. North of Rocking Stone Hill (atop which is a 30-ton boulder that will teeter when pressure is applied) are the Bear Dene, snuggly housing members of American, European and Asiatic species. Neighbors in the community are the rncooonF and the industrious beavers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Other attractions meet our curious eyes: the Reptile House with its pythons crocodiles, giant tortoises end even hlood-sucking bats, the huge home of the elephants, hippopotamuses and rhinocer-0509, and the sea lion pooh The harks uf the sea lions clash with the chorus of scoldings and chatterings of monkeys, apes, baboons and lemurs in the Primate House. Next, a splendid collection of tigers, lions, leopards, pumas and sheetahs receives our hesitant attention we bold our ears to out out the deaf-?ning* roars. Can we afford to by-pass the L-shfqjed Bird House, occupied by a jolorful galaxy of more than 2,000 native </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and foreign birds, many of them as. </span><span class="font13">strange looking an their names? No! Nor will we want to miss the deer and elk ranges, cavorting 2cbrae, wolves, foxes, ducks, geese, pheasants, pigeons, prairie dog village, camels, Hamas, giraffes, kangaroos, platypuses, panda and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">niuner&amp;ns </span><span class="font13">other creatures. Indeed, this is the largest zoo in America!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Like humans, animals become ill. So, an expert veterinarian works in a well-equipped hospital tn (are for I he animal ailments. Treatments range from the extraction </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font13"> hippopotamus nm/urs to hron-i*hilis in monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For those of </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uf</span><span class="font13"> who are botany enthusiasts Bronx Park haa much to offer, for it is the home of the New York Botanical Garden. A huge domed glass building consisting of fifteen subdivisions marks the garden. Palms fill the domed house (90 feet high), and three houses to the southwefst offer a splendid display of cacti century plants and plants of the Old World. Ollier houses which attract us are devoted to flowering tropical plants, bananas, spices, coffee and camphor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the nnmediuTe vicinity of this main conservatory are pools and beds of flowers which hlooui in season. Varieties of water lillies, crocuses, the tall bearded iris and peonies abound, Cannas are cultivated to enormous sizes and flower in August.

<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Prospect Park and Other Attractions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Were we to board a speeding downtown subway train we would soon arrive at the 526 acres of rolling meadows, picturesque bluffs and luxuriant verdure that clothe Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. The park is Brooklyn’s playground, offering its visitors picnic grounds, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, a zoo, ponds</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and lakes, a bandstand and broad drives. Perhaps we could wander across the Long Meadow over to Swan Lake, which is bounded by picnic grounds and refreshment stands. From there we might explore the brook that trickles eastward from Swan Lake, through scenes of charming wildness, flowered beauty, and eventually arrives at Music Grove. The bandstand is fronted by tall trees, beneath which benches are placed, and iu summer the wide-spreading branches form a leafy ceiling for audiences to outdoor concerts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another “must” in our park itinerary should be Van Cortlaudt Park, a 1,132-acre tract at the northern eud of Manhattan Island, 'which was once the popular hunting grounds for the Indians. It offers such facilities as two 18-hole golf courses, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, bridle paths, skiing hills, hiking trails and a 36|-aere lake for boating and ice-skating. And, finally, nearby Fort Ttyon Park attracts us with one of the finest views Manhattan has to offer, for from the heights of this 62-acre park mile after mile of the mighty Hudson river is seen in all its splendor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Hoid Parks Glorify God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The facilities of these and other fine parks are most accommodating fox<sup>1</sup> such events as band concerts, folk dances and the like. But why not put them to good use in glorifying the One who made their natural beauty possible? Why not present Jehovah’s message of hope and life? The quietude and placid atmosphere pf these lovely parks should be a real asset in stimulating meditation on God’s purpose for a perfect, world. And their locations! How convenient for those who would attend! Thus reasoned Jehovah’s witnesses. Consequently, in September 1948, two outdoor free public Bible lectures were held in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, with 2,157 responding to invitations to attend. So successful were these meetings that in April 1949 plans were made to expand the number of park meetings for the summer of 1949, and proper applications for use of the facilities were made. The park officials were very kind and helpful, and as a result. 24 meetings were held in 12 parks, including Central Park, where N, H, Knorr, president of the Watchtower Society, delivered the initial address. The combined attendance was 16,196. Yes, to the park came thousands of men, women and children interested not only in escaping the din of the largest city in the world, but keenly interested in learning the way of escape to' God’s perfect new world.—Ezekiel 36:34; Isaiah 35:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The government wants fanners to take a chance on letting owls, hawks, skunks and weasels kill their poultry in order to save cbm and other crops. Dr. Joseph Liuduska, assistant chief of federal wildlife research, urged farmers to “protect and encourage” the small predators so they can kill insects, mice and other rodents. Dr, Linduska, who claims he ouce caught twenty pounds of mice by hand, said that the advantages of getting rid of insects and rodents will far outweigh the iueonvenienee of a few dead hens. Mice at times may destroy as much us 50 percent of the farmers’ shocked corn and 75 percent of his alfalfa, according to the doctor’s estimates. He added : &quot;Farmers are apt to underestimate the damage done by mice. Losses of poultry to owls, hawks and skunks or weasels—although considerably less in quantity—are more obvious and infuriating. A farmer may save many dollars by avoiding indiscriminate shooting and trapping of small predators. Positive assistance to amall owls by the placing of nesting boxes may save even more.”—INS dispatch of October 25,1949.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Private Wire to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">REQUENTLY Catholic writers resort to catchy illustrations to prove some of their church doctrines that cannot he proved from the Bible. One such illustration was placed in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News </span><span class="font9">by Catholic Information, Greensboro, North Carolina. The writer opened with this statement by an objector: “I mufct say that I do notdike this Catholic idea of confessing one’s sins to a mere man—-perhaps a bad man for all you know.” The writer for the defense answers:-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the sake of argument, we’U mentally create the worst man you can think of, and make him a priest. Then we come to the thought that is bothering you: “How can so bad a man do so godly an act as forgiving sins?” My answer is this similitude:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young man quarrels with his fiancee and breaks the engagement. Later he realizes his fault and .his loss. In great distress he telephones the young lady, confesses his guilt, and asks for her forgiveness and the return of her love. To his great joy back over the wire comes the sweetest of all voices forgiving him and agreeing to take him hack to her heart again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now </span><span class="font7">what would that happy young man </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">think </span><span class="font7">if some skeptic were to tell him that it was impossible for so sweet and sacred a message to come via a mere piece of copper wire, perhaps somewhere along the line filthy with soot and dirt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the Catholic priest has the Christ-given power to forgive sins, he is also like our private wire to God. We need not consider whether he, as a man, is sinful or unworthy. If we think of him at all it is as an instrument through which comes to us, who are truly penitent, God’s own merciful forgiveness, just as surely as the human voice comes over the telephone wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This simple little squib may favorably tickle the ears at first, but how sound is the resemblance drawn? Telephone companies arc very choosy about the wire they use, taking only the best. They insulate their lines to protect the wires from moisture and corrosion. If this insulating protection rots, a short circuit results or a jumble of noise follows, which means no messages go through. Linesmen constantly check the wires and make necessary repairs, for if messages are to flow satisfactorily the equipment must be in Qrder. Accumulations of dirt at connections set up a resistance that interferes with or halts transmission of messages, and corrosion eventually causes the wires to break. The &quot;worst man you can think of” could no more convey messages between God and men than the ‘worst wire you can think of’ could transmit telephone conversation. God’s lines of communication must be insulated from corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the illustration the young man heard the actual voice of his fiancee, had recognized her-voice, knew he had been connected with the right party. How does the Catholic confessor know the priestly “wire” connects with God? He does not hear God’s voice answering him, but hears the &quot;wire” answer back—a thing telephone wires never do I Moreover, the priestly “wire” has n mind of its own and can answer what it will; the inanimate telephone wire only relays the message seut along its strands. If no message is sent, none arrives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AWAKE !</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another point. The article claims that “the Catholic priest has the Christ-given power to forgive sins&quot;. If so, then why send a call into the heavenly switchboard via the private priestly “wire”? Why not just have the priest do the forgiving without telephoning God? Can the priest forgive sins? When Jesus’ power to forgive sins was questioned by religious leaders, He proved His power to forgive by healing the ailment of the forgiven one. (Mark 2:3-12) Can Catholic priests mend crippled bodies in proof of their power to forgive sins? If they respond by pointing to a smattering of claimed miraculous cures, then at best their power to forgive sins would be, just as limited as their miraculous cures, and of no use to the masses of Catholic population, whose sins are as unforgiven as their physical ailments are uncured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ Jesus announced a principle that this Catholic propagandist ignores: “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.” (Matthew 7:15-18, Catholic Douay Bible) An evil priest could not bring forth the good mercies of God. Rather than condone and become a party to wickedness by using corrupt men, Jehovah God commands: “Be ye clean, you that carry the vessels of the Lord.”—Isaias 52:11; James 3:11,12, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Need a man. confess his sins to a Catholic priest? The Bible tells us who is our advocate with God: &quot;These things I Write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just: and he is the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 2:1,2, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay}</span><span class="font9"> Do we. need beads pr priests or Mary to mediate with God for us and get our prayers through to God on their supposed “private wires”? Listen : “There is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” (1 Timothy 2: 5, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font9"> And Christ Jesus is no sin-laden cQnductor of our petitions to God, but is an incorruptible, immortal spirit: “For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undeiiled, separated from sinners.” (Hebrews 7: 26, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font9"> This clean and pure Mediator can relay prayerful petitions to God though spoken outdoors or in one's closet or even unuttered prayers in the recesses of the human mind.—Matthew 6:6; Ephesians 3: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And where does the Catholic priest, good or bad, appear in these texts as a “private wire to God’’? “j'esus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.” “I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” “If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.” (John 14: 6,13,14, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font9"> At no place in the Scriptures are we commanded to channel our prayers to God through some man or woman, or be aided in praying by rosary beads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ Jesus is our Mediator, and He does not need men or organizations, and certainly<sup>7</sup> not when such ones are corrupt. If wicked men have any conn ections with the spirit realm, it is with their father, as identified by<sup>r</sup> Jesus : “You are of your father the devil.” (John 8: 44, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douay) </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ab </span><span class="font9">for being “a private wire to God<sup>-</sup>', they are “wrong numbers”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace of Mind in</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font9">0 YOU ever get the jitters ? Ever get in a frenzy? Are you, like so many people, suffering from a bad case of “nerves”? Nervous indigestion, insomnia, pain over the shoulders or up and down the back—do such annoyances pester you? Or do you unduly fidget, crack knuckles, bite nails, tap with your fingers, or in other ways show signs of pent-up inward agitation? If so, these are sure signs you are on the “nervous side”.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is wrong and what to do about it, are questions that should be answered. Alarmed by the nerve-splintering state of society, the “take things easy” specialists have offered some practical suggestions on how to avoid or remove these jitter-building causes. They have also turned out much advice on haw to relax, how to sleep better, and how to budget one’s tiirte and energies in this fast-moving world. Here are a few ideas for relieving certain types of simple nervousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Snap out of tense postures.</span><span class="font9"> Don’t sit in cramped positions that hinder deep, rhythmic breathing. Find out when yon are really at ease and relaxed, and then assume this position as often as possible, at work or at rest. Here is one doctor’s recipe for relaxing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you don’t know how to relax, try lying flat on your back . . . Now, keeping your knees straight, lift both legs a few inches. . . . When you can’t hold your legs up any longer, let them drop back on the bed, and restj . . . After catching your breath, repeat the performance, . . . When you let<sub>(</sub> your legs fall back, notice how good your abdominal and thigh muscles feel. That is the feeling of relaxation. . . . You can learn to loosen your shoulder and arm muscles by holding your arms off the hed—and your.neck muscles by holding your head off the pillow—and then letting them fall back. These exercises won’t</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a Frenzied World</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">make you sleepy—their purpose is to show you what genuine relaxation feels like, so that you can enjoy it whenever you wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Break up your perpetual motion.</span><span class="font9"> Vary your pace. Change the sitting or standing position. Snap your mind off your work or business now and then. Take five minutes off the job occasionally to relax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Loosen your diaphragm.</span><span class="font9"> Take a deep hreath and, with the mouth closed, hum as long as there is wind in the lungs. The quick, deep breaths that follow will loosen the diaphragm. This tends to ease tension and prevent fatigue due to lack of oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Relax by singing or laughing.</span><span class="font9"> Either of these are good for any kind of “down and out” feeling. If you can’t sing, then hum a soothing melody. “Laughter aids digestion, circulation, perspiration, and has a refreshing effect on the strength of all organs,” says Dr. Christopher Hufe-land. Did you know that people in asylums never really laugh? The Wise Man put it this way: “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine : but a broken spirit drieth the bones.”—Proverbs 17: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Keep regular sleeping hours—and sleep!</span><span class="font9"> It helps to have the room dark and quiet, with a window partly open for ventilation. An hour or so before bedtime start tapering off, both in physical and mental activity. Bed is no place to work, fret or worry. Force the mind to dwell on quiet, pleasant thoughts when boarding the dreamship for a Hight into slumberland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Don’t expect too much in this world. </span><span class="font9">The curse of trying to “keep up with the Joneses”, living beyond one’s means, trying to dress like a movie star, and all that, drives people to frustration. The apostle Paul coilnsels us: “We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. &quot;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:7,8) Just imagine what a delightful world of repose it would be if everybody heeded this good advice! Of a truth, worry accomplishes nothing. “Which of you,” Jesus asks, “with all his worry can add a single hour to his life Matthew 6: 27, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Calmly face, the problems of life.</span><span class="font9"> Cross one bridge at a time, and only when you come to it. Don’t get the mountains and molehills mixed up. When a problem comes up, stand back away from it so you can see the whole picture at once. Then make a decision, a firm one. “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”-—James 1: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Don't &quot;blow your top&quot;.</span><span class="font9"> Really a cloud-<sup>1 </sup>burst of emotion only adds to the raging streams of trouble. Violent expression stirs up' violent action. “A man of quick temper acts foolishly.” If a person replaces angry words with a soothing vocabulary, it helps to quench the fire. “A tranquil mind is health for the body; but passion is a rot in the hones.” “A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but wild words break the spirit”—Proverbs 14:17, 30; 15: 4, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer.-Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Ancient Case of “Nerves”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If only a few unhappy individuals were suffering from nervous disorders they might he isolated anc^ given special care and treatment. The problem, however, has reached the plague stage and the whole world is in a frenzy. Nobody can deny that whole nations have an acute case of “nerves”, yet this is not the first time in history such a condition has existed. Christendom’s neurotic state of mind is really a highly magnified reproduction of the national jitters experienced by the ancient Israelites of Jerusalem when that great city, faced with certain destruction, lay under siege. After nine hundred years of spurning Theocratic rule those Jews considered themselves “modern”, “learned” and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“smart”. That was when they so accurately pictured modern.Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The minds of those Israelites of old were struck with madness, blindness and dismay because of the things they suffered. They experienced drought and blasting of their crops. They groaned under plagues and diseases too numerous to record, such as consumption, fever, inflammation, sunstroke, ulcers and scurvy. They groped in all directions, uncertainly. Hunger, thirst, nakedness and want of many things became their lot. Their cities were besieged until parents ate their children. And in the end their high walls were broken through and they were taken captive. All of this was exactly as it had been foretold.—Deuteronomy 28:15-68, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And why did that ancient nation suffer such nerve-racking calamities? Because they refused to serve Jehovah “in the joy and happiness of mind that came from the abundance of everything” with which God had blessed them. Christendom should have profited from this example of covenant-breaking. “It all happened to them by way of warning for others, and it was written down for the purpose of instructing us whose lot has been cast in the closing hours of the [present evil] world.”—-1 Corinthians 10:11, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But covenant-breaking Christendom disregards all warning and plunges headlong into the state of nervous prostration, even as foretold. There, the Lord tells her, you will have “an anxious mind, spent eyes, and a despondent spirit; your life shall he lived in suspense; you shall live in fear day and night, and never be certain about your life; in the morning you shall say, ‘O that it were evening!’ and in the evening you shall say, ‘O that it were morning!’—because of the terror of mind which frightens you, and the sights that you see”.—Deuteronomy 28: 65-67, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And what hope is there for relief today? Not the formulae of jangle-nerved men. Their remedies do not remove the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">causes for the alarm and anxiety and insecurity that beset the people. </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Noth*</span><span class="font13"> of Lheir recipes bring peace and security and tranquillity of life in a stable, serene and righteous society—the blessed condition for which our nerves are crying. The only hope for relief is the earne as that placed be Tore ancient Israel, and that was deliverance from the mighty woe-maker, Satan the Devil and his oppressive earthly system of tilings. Repentant Jews had their fears, anxieties and upset nerves comforted and quieted by the hope of being restored once again to their land. Today, far greater and more glorious hopes are extended to .all who sigh and cry because of world fjomiitions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">H-Bomb Production Doubted</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&lt;&amp; The task of producing the mechanical device with which to set off a hydrogen bomb will be enormous, according to Dr, Robert A. Millikan, dean of American physicists. He explained that for a few millionths &lt;if a second temperatures and pressures comparable to those In the interior of the stars, approximately 20,00(1,000 degrees Centigrade, would Iio required, and tA'en though it has been suggested that an atom homb be nsed to produce such fnree, he believes “that there is not one chance In a hundred that we can make a hydrogen bomh&quot;. He expressed the opinion (4/51 that the atomic bomb has “done more to educate every man, woman and child In the world to that danger [of self-destruction] than 300 yenrs of preaching and exhorting could have done’’. Fleet admiral Cheater W. Nlmitz expressed a similar opinion (4/14) when he said that he did not believe the hydrogen bomb would be developed in his lifetime, and that he did not believe the United States and the Soviet Union would go to war, but that hope must be put tn three things, the U. N,, the Marshall Plan and national defense.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Submarines came into the news in early April when General Dwight D. Eisenhower advised the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that money should be appropriated for “reinforcement of onr antisubmarine facilities”, and a few days later what were assumed to he unidentified submarines were reported in the Pacific near California. Coinciding with this, U. S. chief of naval operations Admiral Sherman declared (4/3) that he -was far from pleased with the U. S. antisubmarine program, and admiral of the fleet Lord Fraser stated that the British navy is stressing the development of antisubmarine forces. Then it was announced (4/9) that a U.S. submarine equipped with a snorkel (a breathing tnbe extending from the submerged craft -to the surface) made a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zl-day trip from </span><span class="font6">Hong Kong to Hawaii, over 5,000 miles, without coming to the surface, thereby demonstrating </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">the length of time a modern submarine can stay under water Is limited only by its fuel supply. Following this the U.

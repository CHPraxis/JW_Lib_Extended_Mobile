“Blood Puddings”
The Malvern Gazette of July 7, 1950, contained the following report of a discussion that occurred in British Parliament: “Mr. De La Bere also asked whether, in view of the fact that dried animal blood plasma, imported from European slaughterhouses, was being used as a substitute for eggs in cakes and confectionery sold in Great Britain, the Government would give an assurance that steps would be taken to prohibit the sale of this plasma for use as a substitute for eggs, with special regard to the fact that the supply of eggs was more than adequate for all purposes throughout the country? Mr. F. T. Willey, Parliamentary Secretary, stating that the Government would not do so, added that bakers were still short of egg products, and animal plasma was a valuable and harmless substitute. Mr. Walter Fletcher (Member for Bury and Radcliffe): To protect the public from deception should not these be labeled ‘blood puddings’? [Laughter.]” However, this additional case of violation of God’s law prohibiting the eating of blood is not a laughing matter.—Lev. 17:10; Acts 15:29.

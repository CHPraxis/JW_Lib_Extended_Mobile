Field Experience
PREACHING DESPITE PHYSICAL HANDICAP
While group witnessing in Pasadena, California, finding very little interest, I came to a house on the corner. A goatish woman at the door cared more for her religious fodder than for the bread of life, so I went to a small house in the rear, and in response to my knock a voice answered, “Come in!” On entering I saw a man sitting in a wheel chair, his arms no longer than twelve inches, with no hands; his knee joints are at his hips, and his legs very short, and, of course, he is unable to walk. He was born that way. He at once recognized the Kingdom message as the truth, took three bound books, and later subscribed for The Watchtower and Awake! He had previously heard of J. F. Rutherford, a former president of the Watchtower Society. I proceeded with a home Bible study with him. He is self-supporting, a radio announcer, and leaves books with persons in Hollywood that would be difficult for others to reach. He now is a publisher, averages fifteen hours a month, makes back-calls and conducts Bible studies. His brother cares for him, and both attend the company studies. He plans to go to the New York assembly and be immersed. All this in six months’ time.—Publisher in California.
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory . . . believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.—1 Peter 1:7, 8.

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>THE STORY OF TAXATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">3,500 Years of Man's Experience with Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font17">AXES concern themselves with the distribution of the burden of government And since no one likes to bear burdens it is not surprising that the very thought of taxes causes resentment to arise in the minds of most people. Nor is that resentment lessened by the more or less vague realization that the tax burden is higher than it needs to be and that it is not justly distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the main, this story of taxation is one of injustice and oppression, Tracing its history we find that taxes not only affected the economic life of the peoples, but time and again they became the all-important political issue. Wars were fought, governments rose and fell, and more than one ruler lost his life, all because of the unpopularity of certain taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Among the most ancient records telling of taxes are paintings on tombs which show the Egyptians, of some 3,500 years ago, paying taxes in the form of metal wares. An ancient Egyptian papyrus records taxes paid by the nobility and landowners, the national income derived from public works, and the tithes received from the common people some 3,000 years ago. The twenty per cent of the crops that Joseph collected for Pharaoh during the seven years of plenty may be considered as done in the form of a tax.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Taxation in Ancient Israel</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">To what extent the nation of Israel paid taxes, aside from the tithes and offerings they paid to the Levites, from the time they left Egypt until the days of Judge Samuel, the Bible record does not reveal. However, when they asked for a king, God, through Samuel, warned them that, among other things, a human king would prove to be a great tax burden to them: he would take ten per cent of their seed, of their sheep and of the product of their vineyards. Also, he would conscript their sons and daughters for service in his palace, etc, —1 Samuel 8:11-18,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the time of the death of King Solomon this tax burden seemed to have become too heavy to be borne. The people sent emissaries to his son, King Rehoboam, imploring him to reduce their taxes, assuring him that if this were done they would serve him even as they had served his father, King Solomon. Instead of listening to their pleas, Rehoboam increased their burdens, pursuing a harsh tax policy, for which he paid dearly, even as many rulers since his time have done. The people rebelled and he lost ten of the twelve tribes. When he sought to force collection of taxes, his head collector was stoned to death and he himself had to flee for his life.—1 Kings 12:1-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But this rebellion and secession failed to solve the tax worries of the ten tribes. Not only must their continual waning with the two-tribe kingdom have involved a neavy tax burden but before long they were payiAg </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">tribute to Gentile</span><span class="font17"> nations round about them. Clay tablets, as well as the Scriptural record, tell of such kings as Jehu and Menahem paying tribute to the kings of Assyria. (2 Kings 15:20) After an unhappy existence for some 250 years, that nation, conceived in </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font17">protest against high taxes, came to its end. Its </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">sister nation, the two*tribe kingdom of </span><span class="font17">Judah, before jts final end in the year 607 B.C., was also paying tribute to Gentile nations round about, first to Egypt and then to Babylon.—2 Kings 23:35; 24:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Persian “Publicanus”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Although after Medo-Persia conquered Babylon the Jews were allowed to return to their homeland (in 537 B.C.), they were still required to pay such taxes to Gentile rulers. (Nehemiah 9:36,37) In those days the Persian empire required each satrap, or local ruler of a province, to collect a certain amount of revenue, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">placing</span><span class="font17"> him thereby </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font17"> the position of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">publicanus,</span><span class="font17"> or farmer of revenue.<sup>1</sup> Many were the taxes and abuses under this system, people often being sold into slavery because of their inability to pay the tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But the Persian monarchs could be generous when they so chose. Artaxerxes, for instance, took such an interest in the restoring of true worship in Jerusalem that he exempted from taxes all who had anything to do with the temple service there. Nor would we overlook Nehemiah’s generosity. Rather than to still further burden his brethren, the Jews, who were groaning under the empire tax, with the tax for the ipkeep of the local government, as previous governors had done, he bore all the expenses himself. This, among other things, involved the feeding of more than 150 men daily.—Nehemiah 5:4,14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Heavy as was the Persian yoke, the tex burden of the Syrians and Egyptians was still harder to bear. These governments had the custom of selling the tax of a certain land to the highest bidder, who then made sure that he got back not only his original investment but much more. At times such a tax collector would demand as much as half of the farmer’s fruit yield and one-third of his grain as taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Roman Tax Collectors—the Publicans</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Coming down to the time when Jesus was on the earth, the Jews were in bondage to the Romans, whose government exacted tribute by means of tax collectors stationed at the harbors, piers and at the gates of the cities. The Roman “farmers of revenue” were known as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pubhcani. </span><span class="font17">These constituted a society of knights and occupied a most enviable position in the Roman empire, halfway between the senators and freemen. Often these knights would form corporations for the purpose of taking over the contract to gather taxes </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">from a certain</span><span class="font17"> land </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">or province</span><span class="font17"> and then would share the profits. Tax collecting was big business in Rome in those days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Working under the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">publicani,</span><span class="font17"> or knights, were the “chief of the publicans”, of whom Zacchaeus, mentioned, in the Bible, seems to have been one. (See Luke 19:2-10.) Beneath these came the lowly publicans, such as Matthew Levi, who later became one of the twelve apostles. (Matthew 9:9) And though the whole Roman tax structure was honeycombed with corruption, injustice and oppression, it was- these lowly publicans who were the most hated and despised, as it was they who came directly in contact with the people and served in the most apparent way as oppressors of the people. In the Bible we find them linked with sinners and harlots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The emphasis that Rome placed on tax collecting has caused some historians to observe that she conquered lands not so much for glory as for revenue. As a country or province was conquered the governors and tax collectors took over, squeezing the people for all they coulfi get out of them. As a result money flowed into Rome on every hand. Roman citizens built themselves fine houses, with beautiful statues, costly paintings and furnishings, and decked themselves with garments of silk and gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But Rome's tax paradise was not to last The law of retribution, which inexorably penalizes all excess, was soon to catch up with Rome. The peoples of the provinces were unable to pay the exorbitant taxes; so much so that at one time the emperor found it necessary to cancel all land taxes that were eleven years overdue, only to couple it with an-increase on land taxes for the fqture. As a result people left their farms and crowded into the cities. This factor, together with the luxury, vice and idleness of the ruling classes in the cities, started the empire on the road of race suicide which was to cause its decline and eventually sea] its doom. Before its end the publicans had become so unpopular that evildoers were penalized by being made tax collectors.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Taxation in </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medieval Europe</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">As apostate Christianity made itself felt in Rome the clergy began to obtain favors from the secular government, among which was freedom from tax on income. History also records that in the 6th century the African provinces complained about the high taxes of Justinian. And no wonder they were high—only one-third of them ever reached Rome’. A few centuries later Italy rebelled against the Byzantine rule; high taxes were among the grievances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the 11th century William the Conqueror made tax history by being the first one to take a complete census of his country's wealth. He had agents go through the length and breadth of the land, listing all the farms, number of serfs, down to the last cow and pig, as well as listing all other sources of income and what was due the king. This record was called the “Domesday Book”, it being held that it was as impossible to get relief from its taxes as it was to escape doomsday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In England, in the 13th century, the high and arbitrary taxes of King John were in large measure responsible for the uprising of the nobles, which resulted in the signing of the Magna Charts, in 1215, In 1251 the king of Denmark died in a campaign against an uprising of Frisian peasants who refused to pay a new tax known as the “Blood Penny Tax”. The clergy in both England and France complained bitterly about papal taxes. In fact, all during the Middle Ages the people groaned under the twofold tax, to the state and to the church. The latter tax was made especially heavy when two or three popes claimed to be the vicar of Christ at the same time and each insisted on all the pomp and splendor that went with that office!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>English Parliament Taxes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">In the following century the English government tried to levy a new tax, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">poll</span><span class="font17"> tax. This tax was to be paid by each adult regardless of income, exempting only absolute paupers.' This tax, together with the unjust and arbitrary manner in which it was imposed, started a revolution by the peasants, who stormed London and killed the archbishop of Canterbury together with other high officials before they were pekcified by promises of relief and freedom from reprisals. Although the promises in the main were not kept, that did mark the end of the poll tax as far as medieval England was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In 1649 Charles I of England was beheaded, the climax of a rebellion largely caused by his having levied taxes for eleven years without consulting Parliament About the same time England began to adopt an arbitrary and restrictive fiscal policy regarding the American colonies which stirred up deep resentment. This soon revolved around the issue of “No taxation without representation&quot;, This policy of England reached its climax in the Stamp Act, which aroused such violent opposition that it was soon repealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">England was determined, however, to keep its tax hold on the colonies, not so much for the revenue as for the principle of the thing. So she passed other measures which involved very little burden and which tried to sugar-coat the issue. But the colonists were sensitive, they were not taken in by any such subterfuge. Typical of the way they felt about this last maneuver was the “Boston Tea Party&quot;, December 16, 1773, in which some 50 local citizens, disguised as Indians, boarded an English ship and tossed its entire cargo of 340 chests of tea, on which duty was involved, into the sea. Among a number of reprisal measures by England was the closing of the port of Boston until the owners of the tea were indemnified. This touched off a series of events which led to the Revolutionary War, the Declaration of Independence and the birth of the United States.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Taxes in the United States</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">In 1794 occurred the “Whisky Rebellion&quot;, in which Pennsylvania fanners tarred and feathered federal collectors of the whisky tax even though it was but from 7 to 18 cents a gallon. (In 1950 this tax is nine dollars per gallon.) This lawlessness reached such proportions that Washington was oongea to Taise an army oi 15,000 to quell the rebellion against the whisky tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The whisky tax was repealed in 1802, and for the next century tariff on imports supplied nearly all the money needed to run the federal government. The Civil War caused an income tax to be imposed, and that war and the Spanish-American War of 1898 also brought with them temporary taxes on inheritances. An income tax law was passed in 1894, only to have it declared unconstitutional in 1895.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Sixteenth Amendment, passed in 1913, provided that “The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration”. The early part of the twentieth century also saw estate and corporation taxes become a permanent fixture of the United States fiscal policy. As World War I and its profiteering sent expenses to new all-time highs, the government also boosted taxes, taking 77 per cent of all incomes over a million dollars and 80 per cent of war profits of corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With the end of World War I taxes were lowered until the depression and the New Deal effort to lick it caused taxes- to be increased. And as Pearl Harbor made the United States an active participant in World War If new taxes were added as well as old ones raised all along the line. The income tax, which before the war affected only four million, in 1939, now concerns 47,000,000. And though the war ended 5 years ago, the 1949-1950 expenses of the government for war preparations, veteran’s aid, for the Marshall Plan, for the public debt, and the expenses of running the government totaled upward of 40 billion, leaving a deficit of some 3 billion in one of the country’s record income years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A reduction in federal taxes was seen in</span></p><img src="g_E_19501108_files/g_E_19501108-4.png" alt="" style="width:937pt;height:1220pt;">
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Tax Experiments of Bygone Days</span></h1>
<p><span class="font22">L</span><span class="font17">ONG years ago a Frenchman mused:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The art of taxation consists of plucking the goose so as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least amount of squawking.” Many and varied have been the experiments tried by politicians in their efforts to master that art of taxation, as the following examples will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">During the reign of William HI and Mary </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of Great Britain all sorts of taxes </span><span class="font17">were imposed in order to pay for the war in which the queen’s Dutch consort was engaged. Thus births, marriages and deaths were taxed, as well as bachelors and widowers of the term of five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">France made a number of experiments in taxing bachelors to encourage marriage and thus increase its population.'But the wily French bachelors preferred to pay the tax!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To encourage the breeding of fascists, Mussolini exempted parents of ten children from all taxation and on the other hand heavily taxed all bachelors between </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">25</span><span class="font17"> and 60 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Due to its financial straits, Germany in the 1930’s placed an 11 per cent tax upon bachelors in addition to their regular income tax. The women voters being all for it, bachelors’ pleas fell on deaf ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Dog taxes varied: in one country each dog was taxed the same, a dog was a dog, but in another weight determined, and in another the value of the dog determined the tax.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Bricked-in windows in many of the old houses in England are a reminder of the time when </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> windows were taxed. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font17">tax was introduced during the reign of William III in order to defray the cost of recoinage of silver. Many people objected to paying the tax, and it was to lessen the amount that could be demanded that they bricked in some of their windows. The tax remained in existence until 1851, when it was replaced by the inhabited house tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One state in Mexico imposed a tax on all priests, classifying them as “professionals”. The majority claimed that they qould not pay it, so the state placed an embargo </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">on their collections and personal effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Tobacco, liquor, gasoline and sugar are the favorites of political economists of modem times. But in years gone by it was just common salt. According to Marco Polo, “We shall now speak of the revenue which the grand khan draws from the city of Kin-sai and the places within its jurisdiction, constituting the ninth division of kingdom of Manji. In the first place, upon salt, the most productive article, he levies a yearly duty of . . . 6,400,000 ducats [about $14,400,000].” Modem Europe, ft is commonly believed, inherited this salt tax from the Orient, or possibly from the Venetians, who became noted makers and vendors of the seaborne commodity. France had vast natural stores of it, and was among the first nations of the Western world to tax it. That resented impost, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">gdbelle du sei,</span><span class="font17"> or tribute of salt, was one of the causes of the French Revolution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Among England’s strange experiments in the realm of taxation was the tax on beards imposed by old Henry VUI, and which was graduated according to the position occupied by the wearer.

<p><span class="font17">vember, 1941, they had sent highly complimentary words of loyalty to the king, whom they then had praised for acting in the interests </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font17"> the nation. It was quite evident that the king had been working against the idea of Belgium's becoming simply a “buffer state” for France and England, having broken off a war alliance with France in 1938, when Pau! Henri Spaak, recently the king’s leading opponent, was foreign minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But his leanings may have been more Flemish than Belgian, and hence inclined to be pro-German. This was well revealed through the &quot;popular consultation”, which showed that all Flandria was strongly in favor of the king’s return, but the rest of Belgium bitterly opposed. In the March elections the king received only fifty-seven per cent, which is just two per cent more than the minimum required. Previously he had declared he would abdicate if he polled less than fifty-five per cent of the votes. The narrow June vote cited earlier shows matters grew no better for him by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Unfortunately for him, he had only the backing of the Catholic Church and its Christian Socialist party, which has made a greater split between the people on party lines and caused Leopold to become, in effect, a party candidate. That is to say, even with the victory at the polls he became a &quot;party king” and not sovereign of the entire people, because the Socialists and Communists were dead • set against eVer accepting him. The Liberals, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">though </span><span class="font17">monarchists, were not for the return of Leopold, but called for his abdication in favor of young Prince Baudouin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The church championed her &quot;royal son” in the hope of regaining lost prestige and influence and cleverly utilized the women’s suffrage she had maneuvered into existence. The,previous governmental election had revealed that Catholic gains sprang directly from this newly introduced element there. On election, day thousands of nuns had been noticed running about, to and from the election sites. Among the strongest advocates for the return of the king are those who have relatives in prison for having collaborated with the Ger-..mans. These parties hoped that the king’s return would mean either an amnesty or a curtailing of sentence for such prisoners. Since some of the staunchest Catholics are involved, the church had the most to gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But a numerical majority at the polls did not end the wide division of the people extending from party lines through to the family, where many a Belgian who voted against the king’s return found himself with a wife who voted for his return. It would appear that the Socialists and Communists would prefer to eliminate the king’s place in the government entirely. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">However, since they are bound by the</span><span class="font17"> constitution to recognize one, they, like the Liberals, held out for Leopold’s abdication in favor of Prince Baudouin.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Why They Don't Want Bim</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Those opposed to the king’s return heaped many charges upon him. First it is said that the king capitulated without obtaining consent from his government ministers, thus acting contrary to the fundamental law of the land, which he had sworn to uphold. His second marriage, to attractive Mary Liliane Baels, was never popular, especially with the Walloons, who </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">held her Flemish background and her</span><span class="font17"> family’s political record in scorn. They complain that Leopold has ever been proGerman and that he sought to restore old German titles discarded by King Albert J. Finally, his having accepted favors from the Germans is remembered bitterly. He married during the time of war while he was a war prisoner, something that other Belgian prisoners of war could not do; and that with the approval and best wishes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler, who even gent flowers to the bride. Furthermore, the marriage, contrary to Belgian law (article 16 of the constitution), was not performed first by the civil government, but by the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Effective campaigning accompanied the charges. Proof of political swindling by. the pro-Leopold Catholic party was produced by Socialist and Communist groups. In defense, the king’s supporters tried to uphold the 1940 surrender as in the country’s best interests, while generally ignoring the charges of political corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The consultation of the people on the question of the king’s return made by the March 12 election only emphasized the split existing in the country. The king was on the horns of a dilemma and he decided to put the responsibility of the decision on the Parliament. So on Thursday, March 16, he issued a declaration from his residence at Pregny, Switzerland, thanking the electors for their expression of confidence, and then dropping neatly in Parliament’s lap the final loosing of the knotty question of his return to reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Far from solving the problem, however, this move accomplished just the reverse, for, realizing what was intended, the ministers, who disagreed among themselves, threw up their hands and resigned. All over the country twenty-four-hour strikes flared up. As there was no government, there was no one to convene Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Still No Rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a last resort it was decided to convene at the royal palace what is known as &quot;Le Conseil des Sages” (Council of Wise Men), or College of State Ministers, an expedient resorted to only in extreme cases of national crisis. Of course, this is not a governmental body, but merely an advisory council, similar to the Council of the Crown, which has only once been convened, on August 2, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But only an expression of pessimism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 8, 1950 </span><span class="font7">amid continued national strikes and protest meetings came out of this council. One after another, different political personalities were asked by the prince regent to form a government. One after another they accepted, and while the public waited with bated breath they made their several attempts and each time failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The opposing parties remained irreconcilable, so only one alternative remained: the dissolution of Parliament. This meant another general election, the one held on June 4. Though this referendum made possible Leopold’s return, it failed to force half his subject^ to accept him. The country facing virtual anarchy, the abdication in favor of Baudouin became a necessity. But even this has apparently not ended all strife. News reports now reveal that proLeopold Flanders is sulking and taking out its rage on the Catholic party, which recalled the king only to quickly turn in the crisis that followed and urge his abdication. Some talk of secession under an independent Flemish government has even circulated. Though this has not been given serious concern it has produced a new political party, the Flemish Nationalists, wno are not likely to aid in any conciliatory moves with Wallonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Belgium in general have shown much worry and fear as a result of this national strife. It has filled their horizon and influenced their lives and is likely to do so for some time. But some of them are beginning to realize by a study of God’s Word that, as important as it has seemed to them, it is really of very little consequence in this day of world-shaking calamities. They therefore turn away from this confusing question and openly place themselves for Jehovah’s kingdom, realizing that it is the only hope for healing all factional strife, eliminating all disturbers of the peace and producing one just and righteous king for all the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Into the market comes a trio of young girls. On each head is balanced a large enameled basin full of roasted peanuts. How on earth can they walk and weave their way through the throngs in the market place without losing balance and cascading all those nuts to the ground? It is reported that a form of slavery exploiting this ability used to exist in parts of Africa.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JaluiYah's witnesses’ convention through newswrltMs’ eyes</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">M</span><span class="font13">UCH favorable publicity was given the international Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses held in New York city, July 30 to August 6,1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Newspapers, newsreels, radio and television stations, magazine writers; yes, just about everyone who is concerned with news cocked an inquisitive eyebrow when they learned that 80,000 of Jehovah's witnesses'actually </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font13"> assembled in Yankee Stadium, New York, and were going to spend eight days in Christian assembly, just as the Watchtower Society had previously announced. And when 80,000 people get together in these days to study God’s Word, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thaPs news!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Prior to the assembly, news reports had pointed out that this might be a record-shattering gathering. On June 7 the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font13"> described “what may turn out to be the largest convention ever held [in New York] - . . the week-long meeting of . . . Jehovah'^ witnesses”. The New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font13"> (March 28) predicted “one of the largest conventions ever held in New York city, or anywhere else for that matter&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thousands of miles distant, on the British island of Guernsey, readers of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Star </span><span class="font13">(April 18) knew of the convention. Down in Africa the Lagos, Nigeria, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times </span><span class="font13">(March 20) told that a local resident would “attend the International Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be held in July at the Yankee Stadium&quot;. Newspaper readers in Lima, Peru, saw a front-page picture of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Los Testigos de Jehova” who would attend “una gran Asemblea Intemacional — en el Yankee Stadium de Nueva York”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Unknown numbers of other publications throughout the world advised their readers that something unusual would take place in New York. American newspapers, nation wide, published a news dispatch which said “Jehovah’s Witnesses, proclaiming their belief that God’s kingdom on earth will be established soon, open their international convention Sunday in Yankee Stadium”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Much additional publicity was given to the immigration difficulties caused by the false charge of “extreme pacifism” brought upon those Christians who arrived in New York from other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Century</span><span class="font13"> (August 23) called this a “trumped-up charge, for which anyone who knows anything about the Witnesses knows there was no basis, and which would have been no ground for exclusion had it been true”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Newsmen Give Good Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But the newswriters really got busy when they saw the convention in actual operation, and it became evident to them that there was little parallel between Jehovah's witnesses and the usual convention crowd. One writer said, “The hoopla that surrounds many conventions is missing. Jehovah’s witnesses are sober, Bible-following people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font13"> (July 29) reported, “The Witnesses, who believe in the imminence of God’s kingdom on earth, treated each other in friendly, courteous fashion.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">They exchanged greetings whether they knew each other or not and they called each other ‘Brother’ or 'Sister'.” On July 31 it said, ‘‘For all of its large attendance, the opening session of the assembly was remarkable for its quiet, unruffled tone. Even the children were quiet.” An editorial in the same paper orTAugust 1 said, “When 60,000 people gather for a religious meeting—a- meeting which will last eight days—something of moment is taking place in our town. . ? .Yahkee' Stadium has seen manyjgreat crowds in its day, </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">but </span><span class="font17">none more sincere or friendly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just in time to stir up interest before the convention opened, the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font17">(July 27)’and the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font17"> (July 29) carried excellent descriptions of the trailer camp, along with several columns of pictures of it. New~Jersey' papers likewise publicized this camp that had been set up for thousands of the conventioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font17"> (July 28) proclaimed, “Jehovah Sect Expects 100,000 at Conclave,&quot; and told of the trailer camp, the convention program, the main lectures, the baptismal service, the foreign-language meetings, and other interesting convention features. When the convention opened, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Minor</span><span class="font17"> said, “Jehovah’s Witnesses, proclaiming their belief that God’s kingdom on earth will be established soon, open their international convention today in Yankee Stadium.&quot; The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font17"> reported, “The long-heralded convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses . . . will start at Yankee Stadium today.” The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Journal American </span><span class="font17">told that upwards of 65,000 had come for the convention from 67 countries, and perhaps as many as 80,000. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> advised its readers that 40,000 more conventioners had arrived, that nineteen special trains came in the previous day, and Jhat the meetings were open to the public without charge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— -</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">These excellent articles and the abun-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">dance of good, human interest pictures in the New York papers no doubt contributed a large share to the warm welcome Jehovah's witnesses received from many New Yorkers, and to the excellent turnout of New Yorkers at the convention, particularly at the Sunday public lecture.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Huge Attendance on Sunday</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">On Sunday (August 6), the day of the big public lecture, the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font17"> reported on the previous day’s session and Included a summary of the convention talks that explained the Society's radio station, factory, Bethel home, and Gilead school for missionaries. It also reported the Saturday attendance of 89,451. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> summarized some of tije points in the. new book, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font17"> which was released Saturday. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font17"> again devoted the top of page five to convention pictures, and titled its excellent article &quot;Jehovah’s Witnesses inBig Fi</span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">nal</span><span class="font17">e Today&quot;. All this publicity in the Sunday papers helped to increase the curiosity of many of the 30,000 or 35,000 New&gt;. Yorkers who came to_the widely^ advertised Sunday afternoon public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An aerial’view of the record-shattering Sunday afternoon crowd was headed “Capacity—Plus Plenty” by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font17"> on Monday morning. The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> gave a good report and said, “As the vast crowd broke up at dusk, a light still shone in their eyes— even weary little children were laughing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font17"> had an excellent summary of the public lecture, and stated, “Brother N. H. Knorr .. . gave more than 120,000 persons ... a sincerely affirmative, answer yesterday to the key topic of their week-long convention: ‘Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?’.” It also quoted Jimmy Lynch, eleven, from British Columbia, as leaving with the conviction: “I betcha what I learn from this convention will last me four or five years—until the next one, or even more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But all was not yet over, for on Monday following the assembly 28,000 went through the Watchtower's printing plant in'Brooklyn and 23,000 went through the Bethel home which' houses the workers. 17ie~Ti?nes, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font17"> and Brooklyn </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle</span><span class="font17"> carried reports of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Favorable Comment Widespread</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Favorable comment was published in many other papers. Near the site of the trailer camp the New Brunswick (N. J.) Daily </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Home Hews</span><span class="font7"> published an editorial (August 4) saying that the, &quot;convening of the Witnesses has been&quot; so orderly and quiet as to excite much favorable comment They have shown themselves good neighbors ... In times of travail like those of today the religious fervor an^, me faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses is really an example to all of us. ... We could well emulate their devotion, their unselfishness, their faithful service In the observance and propagation of their beliefs”. ;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the convention opened, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Century</span><span class="font7"> (June 28) had said, “Protestants occasionally deplore their inability to stage public demonstrations on a scale like those frequently organized by Roman Catholics. It seems likely, however,^that New York ^in j^cphrrcintgd this symmer witfi oneProtestant gathe^ing^vhich may mhkecventhatblase metropolis sit up and take nonce. . . . it will be interesting to see what attention such a citadel of materialism as New York pays to a millennial demonstration of this size.” Let’s let the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font7"> (August 5) tell us about the attention New York paid to this gathering;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The eight-day assemblage has chai-' lenged the attention of New Yorkers in many ways. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Police assigned to the Stadium </span><span class="font7">have called it the ‘most orderly and sincere’ gathering they have ever covered . .. Ball park employees said that Yankee Stadium has never been kept so clean in all of its history despite the huge crowds in'atteridance daily ... Most New Yorkers who have not visited the Stadium during the convention saw many delegates anyway, since numbers of the latter stationed themselves at crowded points throughout the city to pass out literature, usually </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> official publication. . . . One policeman gave his blessing to the convention like this: ‘It would be a much better city if delegates to all kinds of conventions came here with the same spirit as Jeho-vpns Witnesses.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Few Antagonistic Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These friendly articles by on-the-spot reporters contrast with a few cases of adverse criticism by writers who were generally in other places and lacked firsthand information, but sought to please their readers with a denunciation of an unpopular minority, or perhaps publish their own narrojw-minded prejudices. Showing gross ignorance of the facts a few seized the opportunity to turn convention news into arrogant denunciations, vile attacks, and even outright lies </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">against Jehovah’s</span><span class="font7"> witnesses. But these writers were conspicuous because oTtheir limited number, and most of the dews reports Were written by men who told the truth, about what they saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But even this adverse criticism on the part of a few newswriters whetted the curiosity of many sincere persons who know the truth about Jehovah’s witnesses. The assembly was a great testimony to Jehovah’s name, and the publicity alone has called much attention to the vast scope of the gospel-preaching activity of Jeho-yah’s witnesses. The great publicity that has been given the assembly and the work by the newspapers, newsreels, magazines, radio and television stations, has created curiosity and interest throughout the world, Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate this favorable publicity, thank the Lord for it, a</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd are</span><span class="font7"> determined to continue the witness Ch</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">at has</span><span class="font7"> thus far been given by cultivating to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">full the good will that</span><span class="font7"> was developed a</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd h</span><span class="font7">elping the sincere persons of good will to learn of God’s kingdom and its blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">C</span><span class="font17">AN a marriage ceremony make a man </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font17">oral or unfit to direct secular education? That is what the Catholic Churcn in Panama has declared in regard to Francisco Dia2, who was recently appointed director of secondary education in the Republic of Panama by President Arias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The marriage of a Catholic priest and his appointment - as a director of public education aroused a storm of discussion among the free-thinking Panamanians equal to forums over issues of world importance. The chief instigator of the wave of protest was the Catholic Church, but many loyal Catholics took the opposite side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It all began about twelve years ago, when “Father” Francisco Diaz relinquished his priesthood in order to marry the woman he loved. For such an act he was promptly excommunicated by the church and denounced as immoral. This action on the part of the church, however, puzzled some sincere Catholics as well as many of other faiths who may have recalled the words of the apostle Paul, who said, “But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin.” Or again, “The overseer should therefore be ... a husband of one wife.” (1 Corinthians 7:28; 1 Timothy 3:2, NW) Why then, asked many! call a man immoral simply because he follows the Bible principle and takes himself a wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But despite excommunication Francisco Diaz obtained a position in the educational</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">en%pf the republic as a professor</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">of 'Spanish.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">the association of professors, he </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">has</span><span class="font17"> done his work well. Their comment was: “Professor Diaz’s clean record of service to national education . . . serves as an example of personal decorum, honesty and loyalty to service, and the Association has all right to hope that their colleague will put to the fore the expectations of the professors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nevertheless, a Catholic Action ladies' group in a letter to the daily, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Panama American,</span><span class="font17"> lamented: “Has our country reached such a sad state of degradation that it is impossible to find someone more competent to fill a position of such transcendency, someone free of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">moral vices </span><span class="font17">which afflict Mr. Diaz? ... We believe ... that it has been deliberately done to hurt the religious sentiment of the people, to challenge ideas and principles that cannot be overlooked by those who yet have and appreciate the spiritual legacy of our ancestors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Statements like these aroused other Catholic groups and soon the headlines were screaming that 50,000 men would appear on the streets in protest. But they forgot that the Panamanian likes to think for himself and the constitution guarantees him that freedom of expression. They also forgot that many are Catholic in name only, having long since seen the dishonesty practiced among the religious leaders and noted their unjust and intoler-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ant course of action. At any rare, the 50,000 men in the streets never did materialize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Free Speech vs. Intolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead, one morning the populace awoke to a different tune as freedom of speech was exercised. Many were the comments heard on the streets condemning the church for its intolerant conduct. The association of professors declared the Catholic demand an act of intolerance, and offered as proof a statement appearing in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El Labar</span><span class="font7">o, an official organ of the Catholic Church, which stated; &quot;It is not only a part of the Catholic clergy that oppose the appointment, it is the entire Catholic Church, composed of the Hierarchy, the priesthood, Panamanian and alien, the Catholic associations of ladies, knights, youths, universitarians and non-universi-tarians, who profess the faith of the Roman Catholic Church.” So here we have an entire organization against one man simply because he preferred to marry. Yet their own Catholic Bible says “if thou take a wife, thou bast not sinned”, and records the apostle’s warning on the last days, saying: “Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience seared, forbidding to marry.”—1 Corinthians </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7:28;</span><span class="font7"> 1 Timothy 4:1-3, Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Truly the education of the young is a very serious matter and must be put in the hands of competent persons, as the young mind needs molding and can be easily led. But should not the qualifications of an educator be determined from the standpoint of his ability to teach rather than from the standpoint of his political ideologies, religious creed, color, or social and economic standing? The association of professors answers, “Yes,” and the constitution of a democratic ’ country guarantees such privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One commentator made the statement that &quot;the devil is really the one that backs Catholic Action”, and another that “over sixty per cent of the Panamanian Catholics do not attend church, because of the immoral conduct of its priests and their constant meddling in politics”. Defenders of the church hurled the favorite Catholic charge of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘communism’ against Diaz’s</span><span class="font7"> supporters, the board of directors of the professors’ association, and other groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance Loses to Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Inconsistently, one Catholic voice, that of Mr. Diaz Villa, president of the Federation of Catholic Universities, proclaims: “The Church does not intend to mix in the politics of the nations, because this would belittle its cultural and moral level, because as we all know, Panamanian politics are not pure, and if the Church intends to remain clean it cannot mix with filthy fields filled with mud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Such conclusions are a complete cohtra-</span><span class="font7">diction to the resolution of the Catholic Action ladies and others, who demanded the immediate demotion of Professor Francisco Diaz, especially when they (the Catholic Church) ‘aspired to become the deciding body in the civil and secular ruling of the Panama State*. This was pointed out by the Association of Professors in a communique to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font7"> a Panama daily paper, when they stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“If we were to accept as reasonable the weak arguments of certain members of the Catholic clergy, not only could not Professor Francisco Diaz be director of secondary education, but neither could any nonCatholic Panamanian citizen aspire to the presidency of the Republic. The prejudiced faction of the Catholic clergy is forgetting the fact that precisely the same post of di</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rector of secondary education, with title of secretary of public instruction, has already been brilliantly discharged by a meritorious non-Catholic citizen, the late Mr, Guillermo Andrive . . . There was no faction of the clergy then who dared to overstep any of its pertinent actions.” So why should it now seem to be necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plainly the Catholic Church has seen fit to here oppose a recognized and efficient educator who apparently believes in freedom of expression. As usual the truth has raised up to slap her in the face. Finally, Catholicism’s own record reminds us that it is in countries dominated by the Catholic Church where the largest per cent of illiteracy exists. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Another Attack Backfires</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At length, Professor Diaz retained his post as director of secondary education, and the matter ended, to give way to another similar disturbance. This concerned two priests accused by the church here of apostasy, who were soliciting money for their cause in a small town on the outskirts of Panama city. The Catholic organ, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El Labar o,</span><span class="font7"> in its issue of April 16, 1950, leveled a serites of charges against these men and warned: “These priests are a serious danger which menaces the Catholic Panamanian family by bringing upon them chaos, misunderstanding, dishonesty and disintegration . . . They are in truth two apostate priests who have been condemned and excommunicated by the supreme pontiff . • ■ they do not profess the Catholic doctrine in all its integrity. For that reason they have arrogated to themselves the right to marry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But on April 17, 1950, in the Spanish section of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El Panamd America,</span><span class="font7">. appeared the priests' answer to the above charges, in which they produced credentials of membership in the North American Old Roman Catholic Church. Each of the Cath-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 8, 1950 </span><span class="font7">olic charges was ably refuted, and concerning the matter of marriage they made this interesting reply: “We have not adopted the right to marry, for this is a natural, inalienable right, while celibacy, to the contrary, is merely a disciplinary ecclesiastical action instituted at the time when Pope Gregory VII, in his attempt to combat unbridled simony among the clergy, made celibacy a law, which moral base is only a ministerial convenience, which has been a matter of stumbling and obstacles to those who would strictly comply thereto.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The accused priests’ devastating reply caused quite a stir among the populace. Comments flew thick and fast. Open-minded Catholics have told us on many occasions that the Roman Catholic Church is not interested in dispensing Bible truths or any truth for that matter, but that it is purely a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">negocio,</span><span class="font7"> a commercial business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers may be interested to learn that, as far as it is now known, the two “apostate” priests are not practicing any religious ceremonies, but are diligently and systematically studying the Bible in their home with a missionary who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They are studying and comparing all Bible translations, whether Catholic, Protestant or Jewish, to prove beyond question the truthfulness of the Bible doctrines now taught thew.. They enjoy their studies, especially when such doctrines as trinity, inherent immortality of the soul and hell-fire, all of which they formerly preached themselves, are exposed as false and misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most assuredly, when the pure doctrinal truths and enlightening instruction concerning decent Christian living are brought to light from God’s Word, corrupt practices of the old world and its demon religions quickly disintegrate and are found no more in the minds of honest-hearted men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sensation-serving magazines have played up the “insect menace” to such an extent that there is real danger that the lay public, armed with the recently developed</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Damage Done</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To avoid presenting too rosy a picture, however, some of the ravages of insects deserve brief mention. In general damage falls into three classes: (1) destruction to growing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">crops or</span><span class="font7"> plants; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(2)</span><span class="font7"> destruction of or injury to stored foods, clothing, and manufactured buildings or structures— even metals such as lead cable are sometimes attacked </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by borers; (3) direct harm </span><span class="font7">to man’s body or to that of his domesticated animals through biting, stinging, or insect-transmission and dissemination of disease. The bill chargeable </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to all three </span><span class="font7">causes in the United States (1936) was estimated at $1,326,442,567,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As great as this appears, it can hardly be compared with the injury and death caused by insect-transmission of disease. Through various species of the mosquito the most fearsome of the tropical and subtropical diseases are exclusively carried— yellow fever, malaria, dengue, and elephantiasis (or filariasis). Through the tsetse fly the dreaded African sleeping sickness is ex</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">clusively borne. Through the human louse, trencn lever and typhus fever are solely communicated. Insect-bome also without exception through several varieties of ticks are the Rocky Mountain fever, American relapsing fever (attacking man), and the Texas or splenic fever (attacking cattle). Eleven species of fleas (besides rats and infected humans) spread bubonic plague. The common housefly carries several diseases, among them typhoid fever and diarrhea. Flies, fleas, rabbit lice, and that thoroughly bad actor the spotted-fever tick, ajl carry tularemia (rabbit fever). </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Although making an impressive indict</span><span class="font13"></span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ment against insects, the beneficial side o</span><span class="font13">f </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">insect activity should also be considered</span><span class="font13">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Beneficial Insects</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are many insects that perform useful tasks that man could never accomplish for himself. Among the most important of these is the silkworm. Few people realize that the smooth graceful fabric that adorns beautiful women is the spittle of a caterpillar, the larva or “worm stage” of the moth </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bombyx mori</span><span class="font13"> Linne. This creamy moth lays about 300 or 400 eggs. Three or four weeks later, the hatched worms have become fat on<sub>h</sub> the mulberry leaves they are fed. The last act of the worm is to fashion its silk-lined house, enclosing itself in the cocoon. Each cocoon is composed of a single continuous thread, commonly* averaging about 1,000 feet in length. If the life cycle is permitted complete, the larva changes into a pupa or chrysalid, and after about three weeks the adult moth secretes an ajkaline fluid which softens the silk at one end of the cocoon, and out squeezes a crumpled adult.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19501108_files/g_E_19501108-9.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:219pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">quire few moths, prevent breakage of the cocoon (which renders the strands useless) by dropping the cocoons into hot water to kill the larva or pupa before the transformation. After sorting and soaking in warm water, the threads are skillfully unwound. Several cocoons are,pe-wound together to form reels of raw silk. Subsequently the raw silk is boiled, scoured, steamed, stretched, purified by acids or fermentation, washed and rewashed to remove the gum and bring out the much prized luster; and finally combed and untangled, it is ready for spinning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To appreciate .the arduous work performed by this little creature, making its thousand-foot filament at about 6 inches per minute, consider that it takes 25,000 cocoons and the consumption of about one ton of mulberry leaves to make a ton of silk. A 1,000 billion caterpillars are sacrificed to make the 50 to 70 million pounds marketed annually. Sericulture, before the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">war a $500,000,000 industry, furnishes employment not only in China</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">and Japan but also in France, Italy and Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides the silkworm only one other insect has been domesticated, the honeybee. Its service to man is also prodigious. Without its tireless trips to collect the numerous but infinitesimal portions of nectar secreted profusely by the nectaries of plants, this de-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">Itgh</span><span class="font17">tftii fluid would go to waste. More important still, without the cross-pollination performed simultaneously many of our crops would be cut to one-fourth or less. For one pound of the luscious honey we eat it is estimated that a bee makes 40,000 to 80,000 trips, collecting from many times this number of flowers. These trips are thought to average 1 to 14 miles each. Therefore for a single bee to produce a pound of honey it would need to travel at least twice the distance around the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Work of Pollination</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Flowers have been so constructed by the Creator that it is virtually impossible for the bee to reach the nectar without brushing off some of the pollen from the anther. This yellowish dust is the male germ cell. Bees have a special pollen basket on a segment of the hind leg, which they fill by brushing one leg against the other after the hairs become loaded. Most of this pollen is carried back to the hive to supplement its chief food, honey. Enough, however, remains on its body to deposit some on the stigma of the next flower it crowds down into, thus performing the invaluable task of cross-pollination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Plant life is maintained either by asexual reproduction (formation of buds, bulbs, or tubers) or by sexual reproduction. Among the higher plants sexual reproduction is made possible by the process of pollination, in which the male gamete (pollen) unites with the female gamete. &quot;The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">essential </span><span class="font17">carrier of the pollen (male sex cells) from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of another is in most cases either the wind or some Insect,” states one authority. Among wind-pollinated flowers are the small blossoms of wheat, com, other cereals and pine and oak; while insects usually pollinate the larger and more luxurious blossoms, such as those of ornamental flowers, fruit trees, beans, peas, tomatoes, clover and cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Well-developed corollas, showy colors, strong odors mark the insect-pollinated flowers. About 85 per cent of flowering plants require this latter fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some of this cross-pollination is done by flies, moths and butterflies, but the work of bees is most important because no harmful grqbs are produced while in their manufacture of honey and beeswax. In the United States alone this amounts to 150 to 200 million pounds annually. Beeswax, a body secretion, also has multiple uses, for cosmetics, shaving cream, crayons, floor wax, candles, and electrical and lithographing products. But for every five dollars’ worth of honey, bees may produce $100 worth of fruit. For example, in 1927 one orchard grower who had harvested a peak of 1,500 bushels of apples introduced 40 colonies of bees, which brought an increased </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">yield of 5,200 bushels. Alfalfa has </span><span class="font17">been stepped up from 300 to 1,200 pounds per acre through placement of bees.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Other Services by Insects</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">To a little scale insect goes credit for production of shellac. Shellac has been used extensively for making varnishes, polishes, and for finishing woods and metals, for stiffening hat materials, as an ingredient of lithographic ink, as sealing wax, as insulating material in electrical work, and in making phonograph records, airplanes, toys, linoleum, buttons, shoe polishes, pottery, and imitation fruits and flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The scale insect which produces lac lives on the native trees of India and Burma. Its secretion, which acts as a protective covering, often forms a continuous encrustation on the branches. About 40 to 90 million of these scale insects were collected annually before the war. After grinding in crude, hand-operated mortars, the seed-lac or granules are separated from the dust and wood. The seed-lac is soaked, crushed, dried and heated in long cloths from which the melted lac is squeezed out into pads. Before hardening it is formed into sheets, which in turn are broken into flakes for shipping. Solutions of these form our orange and white shellac. No superior modem substitute has been found (1939). It requires 150,000 of these industrious scale insects to make a pound of liquid shellac, of which the United States used 10 to 20 million pounds annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Another scale insect provides the pigment for rouge and cosmetics, cochineal. It is also used for coloring cakes, beverages, medicines and for dyeing where unusual permanence is desired, and as a sedative for neuralgia. The insects are cultivated chiefly in the Canary Islands, Honduras and Mexico. Mexicans carefully protect the insects indoors during winter, then place the females on branches of the prickly pear for spring breeding, where they multiply rapidly. To harvest they are brushed off into a container/then boiled, purified and sold. For a pound of cochineal 70,000 insects must be collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Insects have some minor uses in medicine and form an item of diet for many primitive peoples. Jamaicans enjoy crickets as a delicacy, which recalls the locust diet of John the Baptist; while Mexicans eat the eggs of a large aquatic bug. Natives of Australia eat quantities of roast bugong moth, which is said to resemble a nut in flavor and oil content. Other natives eat ants, flies, the larvae and pupae of bees, moths, and beetles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">More notable than all these combined benefits is the good which insects perform in destroying other Insects harmful to man. The insect eaters are together known as entomophagous insects, and destroy other insects either as predators or parasites. Among the most useful predators are the dragonfly, voracious eater of mosquitoes; aphid-lions, enemy of aphids; lady beetle (or ladybird or ladybug), the is little red-brown or tan fellow well kii for its hemispherical body and black sjf relisher of aphids, scale, and other haLW ful insects; and the syrphus fly, whose fl® vae kill aphids* Among the parasites av the wasps, whose larvae attack the dead! gypsy moth larvae, and the tachina fly^ attacker of that pest to crops, the army worm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Insects also perform useful service in pruning dense forest groves, reduction of weeds (a moth, introduced into Australia, successfully killed back the spreading prickly pear cactus); as scavengers, and as soil builders. Insects burrow to depths of five feet for the white grub, and ten feet for the nymph of the cicadas. Subterranean tunnels of insects aid water passage, capillary action and soil aeration; their dead bodies and excreta fertilize it. Bringing particles of subsoil to the surface, they perform a service of soil cultivation at least equal to that of the earthworm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">While small in size, this disability is more than offset by the unparalleled number of insects. For example, ants are said to outnumber all other terrestrial animals; and one acre of ground in Illinois was estimated to contain 65 million insects. Considering their many useful services to man and the awesome ingenuity of their construction, it seems likely that some day insects, under proper control, will serve in useful capacities in the new world. Impressed with their importance, Duncan concluded: “It is not too much to say that insects determine the character of man’s world to a far greater extent than he does himself, and that if they were suddenly to disappear completely the world would be changed so extensively that it is extremely doubtful that man would be able to maintain any sort of organized society whatever. ”—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CTO By “Awake!” correspondent fa Paraguay</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">FC T THE end of a 933-nrile trip up the Plata-\ Parana-Paraguay river from Buenos Aires, leave our river boat, quickly go through Customs and come out through the big archway of the building at the port to find our-selves in Asuncion, capital of land-locked Paraguay* Older buildings, many of which are pockmarked with bullet holes from the last revolution, are interspersed with occasional new^ structures of beautiful architecture,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">*; If you are warm, you may want to try a traditional South American drink, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">yerba mate,</span><span class="font15"> before going any farther. Here are several glasses with the dry herb and the bom-bUla (silver straw) just waiting for someone to add a little water. Ice is not so plentiful and melts all too quickly, so none is wasted, but it is put back into the next glass and goes on to the next customer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt; About us we </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font15"> the industrious working women, many with great loads on their heads* If you were to get up very early some morning before daylight and watch from the side of a road leading into town, you would see those living in the country riding burros into the town market loaded with their wares. Each would be found equipped with an umbrella to ward off the hot rays of the sun later to appear, and usually the rider would sport a short, black, hand-rolled cigar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Look! there across the street is a small procession of Indians, They are walking In single file, with the man first, carrying the lightest load, then the woman, followed by two younger girls. Each one is holding an ostrich feather duster and grins broadly as he shakes the duster in the direction of the prospective buyer, at the same time holding up two or three fingers to show the price in guaranies. They won’t have much difficulty selling them, as not only the sefloras buy them to dust their furniture, but the chauffeurs as well to flick the dust off their already gleaming automobiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Notice the ears of the man. The lobes must have been stretched for a number of years to enable him to insert spools of about one-and-a-half-inch diameters into the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">openings, And </span><span class="font15">see the different designs of lines and circles in red or blue colors tatooed on the faces of the woman and girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Following a meal of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">bife a cabaTlo</span><span class="font15"> (beef on horseback), which proves to be beefsteak </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">topped by two fried eggs, we find the streets </span><span class="font15">practically deserted for siesta time* But here comes a streetcar, and we can expect it to come to a full stop because of the ladies in our group, so let’s climb aboard*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One thing that you will never forget about Asuncion is its variety of beautiful multicolored blossoming trees, Its bright vines and bushes and its lovely roses* Just feast your eyes on the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">salmon-colored blossoms that are </span><span class="font15">literally covering that big tree on the right* Then look a little farther up the street to the group of trees all abloom in lavender; or on the left to a st range-looking tree with very few leaves, but at the end of each branch a large cluster of yellow, red and white flowers, giving the appearance of hundreds of small bouquets, making one large display. Cocoa palms, jasmine, mangoes, lime, lemon, orange and banana are just a few of the trees that are sure to please either your sight, smell or taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Have you ever seen cotton growing on trees? There are a great number of large cotton trees here, having barrel-shaped trunks covered with sharp spines* After blossoming, these trees produce large gourdlike pods that mature and break open, making a big, soft cotton ball soon to separate and blow out over the neighborhood. In the midst of all this abundance of vegetation it is no wonder that the Paraguayans are a race of herbalists, having forms of tea from the leaves of trees and plants to treat almost all ills*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Many writers speak of this country as a paradise, because of the abundance of fruit, the luxuriant growth and the healthful climate, But we are reminded of the present problems and difficulties of Paraguay, and realize that the only real hope for this country and for all the rest of the world to become a paradise is the coming thousand-year Kingdom rule of Christ Jesus* Then, as all wars, revolutions and other troubles cease, the words of the psalmist will find fulfillment: “In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">of peace so long as the moon</span><span class="font15"> en-. dureth* He shall hav$ dominion also from sea' to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.’—Psalm 72:7,8.</span></p><img src="g_E_19501108_files/g_E_19501108-11.png" alt="" style="width:946pt;height:1227pt;">
<p><span class="font17">mercy* How canwe do this? First of all by making use of every opportunity to inform others of how they too can receive God's mercy. Yes, by using our time, energy and means to publish the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom we can best show our appreciation of God’s mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Another way in which we can show mercy is by exercising forgiveness toward those with whom we are associated. Here again, only “if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses”. Nor may we weary of forgiving our brother. To Peter, who thought that there should be a limit to the number of times that he should show mercy to an erring brother, and who wondered if it were necessary to forgive him seven times, Jesus replied, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.”—Matthew 6:14,15; 18:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In that connection Jesus gave a parable showing the fate of a servant, who, although having himself received the forgiveness qf a large debt, was unwilling to show like mercy and forgiveness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to one</span><span class="font17"> indebted to him for a much smaller amount. Emphasizing the point of the parable, Jesus stated: “So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.” (Matthew 18:23-35) And Paul shows that such mercy should be shown with cheerfulness.—Romans 12:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To the extent that we are thrown in close proximity with each other, to that extent opportunities will arise for the manifesting of the loving quality of mercy and forgiveness: Christian missionaries in a foreign land, ministers working together in a congregation, members of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">a natural </span><span class="font17">family, husbands, wives, parents, children, brothers and sisters* Each has his own peculiar weaknesses and imperfections, quirks of disposition that may be due to mental or physical handicaps. By showing sue!) mercy we will cover a multitude of sins. If we are stronger we have the privilege of bearing the burdens that the weak make for themselves and others*—1 Peter 4:8; Romans 15:1, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If another has wronged us and we feel that the matter is too serious for us to just “skip it”, let us not make the mistake of brooding over it, letting it grow ever greater in our own minds, and make matters still worse by advertising our brother’s weakness, by gossiping about it* Rather, let us follow the Scriptural rule of going to the offender at some opportune moment, and then kindly, calmly and tactfully bring the matter to his attention* If that fails continue further according to the counsel given by Christ Jesus, at Matthew 18:15-17. And even though he should fail to listen to the counsel of the representative members of the Christian congregation, we may not think of hailing him into court to get what we consider to be justice. Better suffer the wrong patiently, admonishes the apostle.—1 Corinthians 6:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">As has been stated, our exercising mercy </span><span class="font17">assures us merciful consideration at the hands of the great Judge, Jehovah God. But that is not all, it also brings with it other dividends. For one thing, it makes for the peace of mind of the one whom we forgive* It relieves him of the burden of worry and needless regrets* It makes for the smooth functioning of the particular congregation or group of God's servants with which we are associated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And it also blesses the giver, the one showing mercy, in fact, more so, for is it not more blessed to give than to receive? Yes, there is a retributive factor involved in this matter of showing mercy.&lt; Expressing it, we share the comfort and joy that results from it. On the other hand, we make our own lives shallow and bitter if</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">wc withhold mercy. “He that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.” (Proverbs 11:17) Being severe with others makes us automatically severe with ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So let us show mercy to others. Thereby we will assure mercy f or ourselves, we will vindicate God’s expression of mercy to us, we will help our neighbor, bring comfort and joy to him as well as to ourselves. Yes, happy indeed are the merciful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Nile, Egypt’s Treasure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awdkal” corre»pondent in Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font13">HE Nile boasts the world’s longest single unbroken river basin, extending through thirty-five degrees of latitude, 2,450 miles in a direct line. From the falls of Ripon .in equatorial Lake Victoria till its mouth in the Mediterranean sea it flows a total of 3,474 miles, falling short only of the Mississippi-Missouri in total length. The “Blue Nile” and the “White Nile” merge at Khartoum, Sudan, their respective colors gradually blending to form the main Nile. Near Cairo it separates to fprm two branches with the Nile delta in between.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">to offer human sacrifices to the Nile^pffgr-- means of transportation, the greatest part</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Insufficient overflowing of waters during the fixed season from June to September or premature fall is unfavorable to the cultivation of the soil. The life of Egypt is connected with the Nile, on which the land’s economy and trade depend. Thus the inhabitants of the Nile vailey have their reasons to eagerly and anxiously wait for the rising of the river. In ancient times messengers used to go frbmvillageto village ^announcing^Ehe event, of the rise of the waters. This custom continues to this day. Messengers go to the villages shouting in Arabic, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“El Bahr Zad—O’Faleh” </span><span class="font13">meaning, “The waters swelled—Be glad!” It is said that the ancient Egyptians used ing yearly the prettiest virgin and covenanting her witlrtht? river. This celebration is still kept up, but today an elaborate doll is substituted for the virgin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In antiquity inundations changed the delta and all the valley into a sea, so the inhabitants constructed artificial hills on which villages of small hiits were built. These Hoods made great' ravages, but if the swelling of waters was insufficient for the crops, famine overspread the country, Such a plague is mentioned in the' Bible as occurring in Joseph’s time. It lasted seven years, causing the Egyptians to sell all their properties, even themselves, becoming the slaves of Pharaoh, in order to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mena I, founder of the first Pharaonic dynasty, devised the solar (Coptic) calendar, determining the rotation and seasons of the three crops: the Nile, the winter and the summer crops. The Nile crops are timed by the affluence of flood water. Maize and rice are grown in that season. The winter crops such as wheat, barley, beans and flax are grown when the waters of the flood recede from prepared basins; whereas summer crops like cotton, sugar cane, rice and millet are grown in spring, water being lifted for the purpose of irrigatwn. '&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Nile is also used for navigation. Many sailing ships and steamers carrying various goods traverse her waters, creating much trade. Before the advent of other of the trade was carried on by means of the Nile. The river is navigable, but the navigation is sometimes hindered by the formation of little islands of aquatic plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When the river overflows, great quantities of these aquatic plants are detached and form compact bodies in the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The waters of the Nile contain parasite worms that can invade the veins of the human bladder, causing adisease knowr^jts bilharzia^or bilharzioSisT^'tfie''worrris may enter the body through unfiltered drinking water, durin^swhnmin^ or by contact with an open flesh u'ouhd.MetM antimony is used to treat the'aiTment, or death will ensue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In ancient times a beautiful plant called lotus, producing white and blue flowers and a root which induced intoxication, grew in the waters of the Nile. ThQUgh the bjjig lQtus is~ now^extinct,- the white can yetbe found in limited quantities. Of course, jtlie'well-known papyrus plant, used over a period of four thousand years for writing purposes, is also present. Not so well known is this plant’s use as food; The Egyptians ate it boiled, baked, or merely chewed it in' the same way as sugar cane. Moreover, they made dresses, mats, ropes and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">numerous other</span><span class="font17"> useful items, with it, and the roots were used for fuel. The priests used it to make special shoes for their use which they called </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">biblina&gt;</span><span class="font17"> because papyrus itself _was called biptos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Tine ILife’s integral connection with the land’s life probably accounts for its being considered by the ancient Egyptians as a god, and for their worship of it instead of the Creator of all these natural wonders. Now many of earth’s peoples are learning that Jehovah God is the source of all life and that under the direction of his heaven-gjoyernment the whglQ earth will be &quot;transformed into''agardenparadise as ‘the wilderness * solitary place * - . and the desert . - . blossom as the rose\</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Daily, world conditions become more uncertain, life more troubled, and the prospects for happinessr seem ever farther from the grasp. As earth’s giants again gird for war, many of the people despair for their very lives. In the face of all this it may at first seem incongruous to ask, Can you live forever in happiness on earth? But, to the satisfaction of thousands, this question was recently Scripturally answered in the affirmative by Mr. N. H. Knorr, president^ of the Watchtower Society, at Yankee Stadium.

<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; As the Korean war entered its fourth month U. N. forces captured Seoul (9/26) and restored the capital to South Korean president Rhee (9/29)-Meanwhile, the communists in the south were being sent reeling back. U. N. troops from the northern and southern fronts united (9/26), cutting oH probably 35,000 invaders still left in the south. Seoul was 65 per cent destroyed. Kumchon had been leveled by 1,600 U&lt; S. shells. In just twelve days after the landing at Inchon the entire military picture had been reversed, and the smashed Reds fled for North Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Opinions on whether the battle should be carried north of the former boundary at the 38th parallel differed, but U<sub>z</sub> N. officials left the decision up to MacArthur. He gave no indication of stopping and called on the North Koreans to surrender “to avoid total defeat’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">&amp; By September 22, U- £• troops in Korea had suffered 17,220 casualties. This was 3,309 higher than the total at the end of the previous week, and Includes 2,441 dead and 3,959 missing in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">U. N. General Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; The General Assembly, the centerpiece of the ’LL N. in which each meipber nation has</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a vote, convened for its fifth session (9/19). While its political powers are limited to making recommendations, these can carry great weight. At its opening the delegates stood in silence for one minute while those who wished prayed. Nasrollah Entezam of Iran was elected president. India and Russia proposed that Communist China be admitted, but were voted down. Later, when it was suggested that all concerned with the Formosan discussion “have a full opportu-' nity to express their views”, Communist China was invited to send a representative for the first time, on November 15. Among many other items to be considered was the U. S. proposal for the General Assembly (where the veto is not allowed) to take the Security Council’s power in the event that a Russian veto blocks that council from dealing with any future act of aggression. Many non communist delegates favored this proposal. After a week of general debate Secretary General Trygve Lie said (9/28) that the world is at present more sharply divided than at any time since the U. N. was founded, but that decisive action for war or peace may be taken at this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace Winner Views Korea</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ralph J. Bunche, who won the Nobel peace prize (9/22) for his success as U. N. media’ tor between Israel and the Arab states, said (9/25) that the U. N. action in defense of South Korea is a “turning point in modem history”. He believes that the Korean success offers a prospect that the U. N. vyill be able to keep the peace despite great difficulties ahead. Incidentally, he is the first Negro to win the Nobel peace prize.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; Indonesia was accepted as the 60th member of the U. N. (9/28) and many speakers voiced their country’s welcome. Some referred to it as &quot;the child of the United Nations”. Thi&amp; Is the first country to be admitted since Israel joined,in May, 1949. Admission of nine other countries has been blocked by Russian vetoes, and five Soviet-s ponsored applicants have not received the required number of votes in the Security Council.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; President Truman refused to sign Congress<sup>1</sup> Communist control bill and sent it back with a blistering 5,50(Xword veto message. His objections mentioned that the bill would put the government in the “thought control business”, Im* plied that the communists would not register as the bill demands and said that free speech would be infringed upon. Opposition concerned the strictness of the bill's methods, not its purpose to increase internal security. The House promptly overrode Truman’s veto. In the Senate a 21-hour filibuster held up the vote, but during a 29-hpur session it overrode Truman’s veto by a vote of 57 to 10. One communist spokesman said that party members will not register, even though they face a $10,000 fine and five years in prison for not doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Taxes—Going Up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The 20 per cent increase in the federal withholding tax on the salaries of an estimated 45 million U. S. wage earners applies to all income received in the last three months of 1950, as well as to 1951 income. With federal taxes getting bigger, Chicago's Commerce Clearing House estimated that state taxes reached an average of $60.72 for every person in the U. S&lt; Washington hud the high-jest with $97.76, and New Jersey the lowest with $39.23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Draft Proposals</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">$ Expansion of the selective service law was urged in Washington by draft director Hershey (9/29), and Secretary of Defense Marshall appealed for universal military training (9/21). Despite Korean advances the army wants 300,000 draftees in the next six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Virgin Island Racial Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; A new civil rights law in the Virgin Islands (a growing Caribbean vacation resort where 95 per cent of the population is Negro) provides penalties up to $1,000 in fines and damages and ninety days in jail tor any resort operator who discriminates because of “race, creed, color or national origin”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The national election campaign was under way in Brazil in September. Floods of paper slips fluttered everywhere amid a din of speakers. Getulio Vargas, who lost the presidency in 1945, campaigned for re-election. During a speech law students draped black flags in tribute to the rights he supposedly suppressed as president.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A young Catholic mother sent a letter to WBBR, requesting more information. I received the letter from the station and made the call. She had lost her only son of ten years of age through drowning, but when she sought comfort from her priest she was told his death was a judgment from God for her not having been a good Catholic. She had implored the priest to spare her son the fire of purgatory, but to no avail. Frantic, unable to eat or sleep, she contemplated suicide. Then by chance she tuned in on WBBR. She heard of a new world of peace without death, she heard of the dead being asleep, resting until a resurrection, when God would bring them back again to a cleansed earth. Hope sprang up in her heart and she had written for someone to call on her. She had asked that the caller come in the forenoon, as her husband would not be home, for she supposed her husband opposed her listening to WBBR. But when I called her husband was unexpectedly home, yet as I discussed world conditions and God’s purposes to bring in a new world of righteousness he nodded in agreement. I finally asked how he had gained so much knowledge. To his wife’s amazement he said that every evening, while she put the children to bed, he had been listening to WBBR! I immediately arranged for a study in that home, and now the mother and one daughter are active in Jehovah’s service.”—New York city publisher.</p>

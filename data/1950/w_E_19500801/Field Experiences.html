<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Lord is now gathering the “sheep”, even in hospitals and despite opposition. About eight months ago I was confined in a hospital superintended by a former religious medical missionary who forbade Jehovah’s witnesses to enter and preach. Nevertheless, Jehovah’s arm was not shortened. One day a fellow patient asked what I thought about eternal life, and told me some new things he’d recently learned from another patient, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and recommended that I talk to him. He was a pioneer, and gave me <em>The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind. </em>When he later asked for a comment I said, “I can’t see that it is anything new.” He merely replied, “No, the Bible is an old book.” But he thereafter gave me <em>“Let God Be True”. </em>I read it through twice before I began to understand how very new it was, in comparison with all the religious misinformation I’d collected. My first thought was that it was wrong; but my resistance could not withstand the Scriptural facts. I studied in my free time, of which I had much. Later a girl from the Lima company started a Bible study with me.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I cannot say when my own ministry began, for I’d discussed the truth with another patient almost immediately, and later began a study with that patient. Sometimes others were drawn into the discussion, and witnessing opportunities grew. I was privileged to report my ministry time, and did so until my hospital discharge in November. My first real contact was with the man who conducted the hospital Sunday-school class. He returned the <em>“Let God Be True” </em>I gave him, with the admonition, “Burn it.” In our conversation that followed he wanted me to believe that he had read the book, yet said that Jehovah’s witnesses didn’t believe in Christ, didn’t believe in being saved, used only the so-called Old Testament, and that he would not waste time talking to the witnesses as he was not qualified—nor did he know who was! I continued attending his class till my discharge, but my comments there were deliberately ignored. He charged that the witnesses jumped here and there in the Bible, and that anything could be proved that way. Hence I was quite surprised to find that our Sunday-school lesson was taken from eight different sections of Scripture with no more than three verses from any one division. The Lima company had been refused permission to enter and preach at this hospital because its teaching was not orthodox; other religious organizations were allowed to enter. One patient overheard me preaching to another, and called me to her room to say, “I’m with you, Kid. Yes, indeed, you were really talking the truth. Do you mind my asking what church you belong to?” When I replied that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses she declined to discuss the matter with me further, because she didn’t believe what they taught. Today I am home, and am associated with the local company in declaring these new things to others. It is a great privilege to share in the ever-increasing song of praise; it is too wonderful to bear in silence. So it is with grateful heart that I join you in His vindication by preaching the true word.—Publisher in Ohio.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One of the Dixon, Illinois, publishers recently placed a <em>“Let God Be True” </em>book with a lady, who on the return visit asked him to address the “Ladies’ prayer meeting”, consisting of about nine women from the local Baptist church. This the witness did, and delivered a talk on God’s purposes in this day. The ladies’ questions were also answered and he was invited back the next week. Again more Bible questions were answered, and then the proper method of conducting a home Bible study was introduced, using the <em>“Let God Be True” </em>as a Bible study help. Result: the study continues and participants really enjoy it. All admit they never learned as much in their church. Two of the attendants dropped out, for obvious reasons. “Earth’s New Rulers” was a talk enjoyed by the group. They are now telling their friends and neighbors the good things of the Kingdom. With the ladies on the offensive in declaring the truth, the local pastor has been having difficulty maintaining his poise while on the defensive. “Earth’s New Rulers” was given in two parlor talks to groups in the rurals, with 21 in attendance in addition to 45 at the public lecture.—Circuit servant in Illinois.</p>

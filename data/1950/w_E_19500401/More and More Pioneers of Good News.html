<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">This article makes searching examination of full-time ministry service as a career. It considers some of the pioneer’s problems, the requirements, and how to stick to this service. It calls notice to how children may share in pioneering. Because of the service theme, the article will be studied at the service meeting instead of the <em>“Watchtower” </em>study. By the regular <em>“Watchtower” </em>study method, each company should consider it during the last three service meetings in April. Use no more than 30 minutes of each meeting for the study, and at the first meeting consider paragraphs 1-10; at the second, 11-21; at the third, 22-31</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 1. Where is humanity now plunging? How can man halt from the plunge?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">THIRTY-SIX years have gone by since God established his kingdom in heaven for mankind’s benefit. The “day of Jehovah” beginning A.D. 1914 is far spent and the accomplished end of this world is at hand. The human family is facing the greatest slaughter since the days of Noah. After the storm of Armageddon has passed there will not be enough living to bury the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:33-24:25:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:33</a>) Carrion-eating birds of prey and wild beasts of the field and forest will be summoned to a feast of human flesh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:34:20-24:34:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 34:20</a>) The invisible demon forces can no doubt see Jehovah’s Chief Executioner, Christ Jesus, closing in on them. Frantically their desperate and turbulent influence moves upon the kings of the earth to drive them like stampeding cattle to their doom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>) That is why the rulers of the earth are confused and frustrated, with each nation dashing against another like the roaring sea pounding its rocky shores; men’s hearts failing them for fear of what they see coming upon the earth. As the end draws ever closer, the pressure of the demons increases; earth’s rulers become more desperate and arrogant, resulting in more and more oppression to the sea of humanity. Only by a knowledge of God’s kingdom and with complete reliance upon it can man stop his headlong rush down to the Dead Sea of Armageddon.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 2. How does God show concern for the oppressed and uninformed?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jehovah has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; how much less in the death of the oppressed and uninformed! In this class there are many meek and teachable ones who sigh and cry because of the abominations committed in the land. Even though the future may look dark and hopeless for many, there is, however, a way of escape. Down through the ages Jehovah has always shown concern for the oppressed. In olden times he sent his prophets to sound warnings and point out the way of relief and to leave a written record for future generations. Now in this “time of the end” do you think God would leave this world to its doom without sounding a warning and pointing out a way of escape? To be sure, He would not do it and has not done it!</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 3. Why does the Society exist? What special calls does it issue?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Today Jehovah God has a modern, efficient, working organization of ministers who are completely devoted to him and governed by his spirit. God’s spirit directed them in organizing their legal corporation, known as the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, as an instrument to facilitate the sounding of a world-wide warning before the accomplished end. The Watch Tower Society classes Jehovah’s active ministers or witnesses in two groups: the group preaching only part-time and the other class on more of a full-time basis, preaching at least one hundred hours a month. This latter class the Society refers to as “pioneer ministers”. From time to time special letters showing the urgent need for more to enter pioneer service are sent to all companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. The reason for continual <span id="page104" class="pageNum" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>pioneer calls by the Society can be better appreciated when one analyzes the contents of the inspired written records left for this generation.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4. How did the Son show concern like God’s for suffering mankind?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The sacred writings foretold a Messiah who would vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and provide a ransom for the dying human family. True to God’s written Word his firstborn Son appeared on earth to do his Father’s will. The same loving concern shown by God for suffering mankind was also shown by his Son in no uncertain way. While he did not appear dressed like an American pioneer in buckskin with a rifle swung over his shoulder, he was at first like a man breaking ground and blazing the trail through a religious wilderness; a wilderness of ecclesiastical traditions that had the people snared and alienated from true worship. With a hearty pioneer spirit Jesus cut a trail through the Jews’ religion that left a path out of it beaming with the light of truth. A straight and narrow path it was, when compared with the broad way that leads to destruction, but, nevertheless, it led to freedom and life eternal.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5. How was he a perfect example of a full-time pioneer minister?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus Christ was a perfect example of a full-time pioneer minister. He fully realized the hopeless condition of the Jews bound up in their religious traditions, and so did everything then possible to save them. Great feeling, sympathy and anxious concern for Jerusalem’s welfare are seen in him when he said: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!” With Jesus it was always, ‘not my will, but yours be done, on earth even as it is done in heaven.’ This being true, one could not help but notice the driving force of God’s spirit moving him to increase the intensity of gospel-preaching as the end of his earthly ministry drew to a close.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 6. To escape destruction and enter the Kingdom, what was needed?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>So much was this increase that the religionists of that day conspired to kill him before their pastures were completely spoiled. The urgency of the message could be seen and felt by those hearing Jesus’ earnest and stirring appeal on the great day of the feast of tabernacles: “In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:37-43:7:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 7:37, 38</a>) All the Jews had to do was to accept Jesus as their Messiah; not by blind faith, but by searching out the Scriptures foretelling him and seeing the physical fulfillment before their very eyes. Doing so, they would have escaped the destruction of Jerusalem A.D. 70 and also gained eternal life in the Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 7. How did ‘waters flow forth out of believers’? With what result?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>During the time of Jesus and his apostles the ministry expanded more and more. As others heard and responded, ‘out of their bellies the living water flowed’ after the holy spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost A.D. 33, and this “water” in turn reached others who also responded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:38-43:7:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 7:38, 39</a>) And so on until about forty years later, when Jerusalem was destroyed. Jehovah did not then hold those early ministers bloodguilty. They had sounded the warning, resulting in salvation for those heeding and destruction for those scoffing. Today the Watch Tower Society shows the same concern for this generation now facing world destruction at Armageddon. Two great opposing organizations are set for a showdown fight then to settle once and for all the issue of supremacy. Satan’s strategy is to keep the people in ignorance and let them stumble blindly into the pit of Armageddon’s slaughter. God’s purpose is to sound a warning by sending his witnesses throughout the land, to open the eyes of the blind and release those who sit in darkness.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 8. How is God’s mercy expressed through his witness organization?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Christ Jesus is now invisibly present in his kingdom, ruling in the midst of his enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) He is zealous for Jehovah’s side of the issue and will show no mercy to those who will not forsake the camp of the great adversary. On the other hand, his spirit of mercy toward the oppressed has not lessened in the least from the time of his visible earthly sojourn. His footstep followers now on the earth also appreciate the issue and have a peculiar zeal for Jehovah’s side of the controversy. They realize the people of this generation are faced with a great decision and to make it intelligently they must have understanding. Here God’s mercy is expressed to the nations through his organization on the earth, by sending his ministers to them. Truly the work of Jehovah is not in vain, for many from all nations, kindreds and tongues are coming up the straight and sure path that leads to life. The ministry expands more and more, but still the harvest is great and in comparison the laborers are few. Therefore the crying need for more laborers to be sent into the field. The Watch Tower Society, realizing this, is continually moved by God’s spirit to send out calls for more pioneers.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>CONDITIONS FOR ENTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 9. Why should a person consider the pioneer service? In what way?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>None should close his mind to these calls and assume that pioneer service is out of the question as far as he is concerned. If you are one of Jehovah’s consecrated witnesses, you must realize that all things are possible with God. He can even make YOU a pioneer. By urging more to take up the pioneer <span id="page105" class="pageNum" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>ministry the Society does not expect you to do so without due consideration. Such a decision must in the final analysis be made soberly before Jehovah with full confidence and reliance upon him. If a man has a family and gains a knowledge of the truth and desires to become a full-time minister, it would not be proper for him to do so unless he could provide for his family at the same time. Those who do not provide for their own, says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, are worse than unbelievers.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">10. How should one in marriage ties decide as to pioneer work?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Neither would it be proper for the husband to separate from his wife because of her unbelief, or vice versa, and enter the pioneer work. If the unbelieving one is willing to live with the consecrated Christian, due consideration should be given to the unbeliever by the consecrated one. This is the Scriptural course, and it may be that the wise and considerate course taken by the consecrated one will win the unbelieving one over to Jehovah’s side. God joined man and woman in marriage, and the truth should not separate them unless the unbelieving one refuses to remain with the one who desires to serve Jehovah God. Then, of course, this would leave the consecrated free to concentrate upon the Kingdom work. We are admonished to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. To do this the spirit of a sound mind must be used. Emotions should not be permitted to lead one into a hasty decision on the spur of the moment. Jesus advised his servants to seek first the Kingdom, promising that the material things would be added.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">11. As to service, what does seeking first the Kingdom mean?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Seeking the Kingdom first means one would have uppermost in his mind at all times the Kingdom interests. Such one would be looking for opportunities to serve in its behalf, and not be forever seeking first his material needs and laying up worldly goods to safeguard his future. To be sure, not all will be able to take up the full-time ministry. Nevertheless, this advice applies just as much to those who find it necessary to engage in secular activities for financial support. By seeking continually to serve the Kingdom as opportunity affords, many have seen their way cleared for entry into the pioneer service. Thousands have taken advantage of such opportunities, and, no doubt, there are now associated with companies of Jehovah’s witnesses thousands more who could become pioneers if the privilege were sought after more earnestly.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">12. Why is part-time work for pioneers not to be frowned upon?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Many housewives find it possible to work in three or four hours each day telling others about the kingdom blessings. Maybe you are one who could do likewise. If so, then you should seriously consider the pioneer calls. It may even be possible for both the husband and wife to pioneer, by one or both of them doing some part-time secular work. Part-time work to maintain one in the ministry is not to be frowned upon. That is exactly what the apostle Paul did in order that he might not be a burden upon those to whom he preached. Thus doing, no offense could be found against him, except it be found against the message itself. However, orthodox religions of this world do not look upon this method with favor. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses do not herd their congregations into elaborate cathedrals and confront them continually with a collection basket throughout the services.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">13. How about the amount of our secular work and use of mammon?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jehovah’s witnesses come from all walks of life, engaging in all trades of secular activities. Their first aim is to please Jehovah God by faithfully fulfilling their consecration vows to preach. The amount of secular activity engaged in is governed by the circumstances. When it comes to storing up wealth for the future or for living in extravagance now, Christians should consider Jesus’ counsel: ‘Lay not up gold and silver where thieves break in and steal.’ If this course of laying up earthly treasures is followed, there is where the heart and mind will be also. But the “mammon of unrighteousness”, when used wisely now, can cause its user to be received by our true Friends, Jehovah and Christ, into everlasting habitations when it fails. Why? Because the treasures of such one are stored in heaven, where no thieves can steal, and because their money was used only as a means, directly or indirectly, to sustain them in seeking the Kingdom first.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:9-42:16:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 16:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>DIVINE SUPPORT FOR THE WORK</strong></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">14, 15. How does the minister put God on the spot as in Israel’s case?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>The consecrated minister puts God on the spot, so to speak, in that he takes Jehovah at his word. By sound reasoning he considers his course to be the same as that taken by Israel when Jehovah called them out of Egypt. Israel was in bondage to the world power of that time and under great, oppressive burdens. By the hand of Moses God delivered them after bringing upon Egypt ten devastating plagues. The final ones were those of thick darkness and of the killing of Egypt’s firstborn. With a crowning demonstration of his mighty power God opened the Red sea and Israel marched through on dry land. Pharaoh and his army, driven by wild, blinding anger, plunged into the breach, only to be trapped and completely destroyed. Such a mighty demonstration of mass deliverance and mass slaughter brought Jehovah’s name prominently into the view of that world. His name had been placed on a people of his choice.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>After all this, do you think God would permit Israel to perish in the wilderness? Do you think he would permit it to be said: ‘God was able to deliver <span id="page106" class="pageNum" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>Israel from bondage but was not able to sustain them through their wilderness sojourn’? Absolutely not! For his name’s sake Jehovah preserved over 2,000,000 Israelites for forty years. Their clothes did not grow old and rot; their sandals did not wear out, and the manna from heaven never failed to stay their hunger. Israel did not live in luxury, but had sufficient while on the march toward the Promised Land. Above all, they had plenty of spiritual food, supplied through Moses and the Levitical priesthood. With the fruitful land of promise before them, peace and patience and contentment should have been theirs.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">16. What is promised and provided, with which to be content?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Today a like deliverance is taking place for thousands, yes, and for probably millions before the final count at Armageddon. This great multitude are those delivered from bondage to the present evil world. To them the higher powers of this world are as destroyed already; they recognize only Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus as “The Higher Powers”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a>) Their eyes of understanding see before them the promised new world “flowing with milk and honey”. Just as surely as Jehovah called his people out of Egypt by the hand of his servant Moses, so now he is calling his people out of antitypical Egypt under his greater Moses, Christ Jesus. No life of luxury in abundance and ease is promised to these now. But there is ample of what they need most to sustain them. What’s that? you say. It is a table of spiritual food, “meat in due season,” surpassing anything ever before supplied. With such spiritual blessings and the grand hope of a new world so near God’s servants can show the same patient attitude as Paul, who said: “Having food and raiment let us be therewith content” for “godliness with contentment is great gain”.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">17. With increased appreciation of God, how do we look on matters?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>As the Christian grows in spiritual understanding and maturity his appreciation of God increases. The things of this life that in times past rated first in importance receive now but little attention. He considers the plight of those groping about in the thick darkness of antitypical Egypt and does what he can to open their eyes to the only light. If the Lord God opens their eyes to the light of truth it will lead them safely through this old world wilderness of tangled politics, commerce and religion.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>CHILD PIONEERS</strong></p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">18. What does the Society urge children to become, and why?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Israelite children also marched in that exodus from Egypt and continued through the wilderness to inherit the Promised Land. Children today are numbered in the ranks of God’s people on the march to the new world. They, too, must be strong spiritually and ready to identify themselves by testifying before others. For this reason parents are admonished to raise their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. For the child’s own good and to the praise of God the Watch Tower Society also urges children to become vacation pioneers. “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise,” said Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:16-40:21:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 21:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:2-19:8:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ps. 8:2</a>) Would it not make you parents happy and proud to have a child instilled with the desire to serve its Creator? To know that it, through knowledge and understanding, had chosen to serve God instead of running the usual course for children of this world? A course that might even lead to delinquency, bringing shame and reproach on you.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">19. How might some decide against the child’s best interest? Why?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>To the contrary, you might say: ‘I love my child too much to fill his young mind with ideas that would cause him to become unpopular with his neighborhood playmates, and for this reason I will not encourage him to serve God now, but will wait until he is grown; then he can decide for himself.’ Is this true love for the child? True love would be to take the course that would benefit the child most, over the longest period of time. At Armageddon’s slaughter old and young alike will not be spared. After the marking work had been done according to Jehovah’s instructions, the command to his executioners then was: “Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:6-26:9:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:6</a>) Therefore no guarantee is given that a child will pass through Armageddon by reason of the field-service record of a parent that is careless toward his own children. In fact, the parent might be zealous and faithful on every point except that of offering his own children freely in God’s service. The selfish love held for a child might cause a parent to try to protect it from the adversary’s rebukes which come to all who stand for the Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">20. What does Abraham’s course show as to deciding for one’s child?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Consider Abraham, who withheld not his only beloved son from God. Abraham taught Isaac concerning Jehovah and, when it was time for him to be offered in obedience to Jehovah’s command, he was ready and willing. Suppose Isaac, through lack of knowledge, had become panic-stricken and had broken away from his father and raced off over the hills. Or, on the other side, suppose Abraham’s faith in God had been shaken by a selfish love he might have held for his son, and so he had refused to obey. Jehovah’s purpose would not have been served in making a prophetic picture foretelling the sacrifice of his only-begotten son. It was more of a test upon Abraham than upon Isaac, but Abraham knew that to obey was the wise course. It would result in the most good to himself and to his beloved son. Imagine the joy and satisfaction to both Abraham and the young fellow when Jehovah said: “Lay not thine hand upon the <span id="page107" class="pageNum" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son . . . in blessing I will bless thee, . . . and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:12-1:22:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 22:12-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">21. How was Jesus, like Isaac, a wise son?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Jehovah did not ask Abraham to do something that He was not willing to do himself. As a boy Jehovah’s son Jesus had early training, and this created in him the desire to know more about his heavenly Father. So at a tender age he was at his Father’s courts inquiring and discussing. Even though this course led him into conflict with the then-existing world and resulted in his death on the stake, he never for a minute wanted to turn back. Truly, then, Isaac and Jesus were wise sons and made the heart of their fathers glad.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">22. How can parents incline and help children to serving God more?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Shining examples such as these illuminate the path for present-day parents to follow in raising the children. If you have children, help them to have and to hold the desire to serve their Creator. Make it possible for them to respond to the call for vacation pioneers. Many will respond if they are properly taught. Many will respond if they are properly taught at home and taken to the Kingdom Hall studies regularly and, with you, into the field service. Doing this they will not become a part of this world’s rising tide of child delinquents, but will contribute to the ever-increasing Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">23. What will motivate the child to answer the pioneer call?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>From the child’s viewpoint his young mind will be able to see the difference between standards of this world and those of the new world, even as they apply to children of his own age. Instead of his mind’s being filled with hero-worship, such as of “Superman, Dick Tracy, and the Lone Ranger”, he will soberly consider faithful men of valor, such as Joshua and David. If he is frowned upon for not showing the same zeal for present-day sports-champions, he need not be duly concerned. He will find satisfaction in pointing out that none of their champions could “hold a candle beside” David, who slew a lion while a young shepherd and killed a huge giant with a sling; and Samson, who slew a thousand foes with the jawbone of an ass. The child who is diligent and enthusiastic about serving his Maker holds promise of living in a beautiful earthly paradise where all beasts of the forest will be his pets. Love for God and faith in his promises will be the motivating power that will cause him to respond to vacation pioneering. During this past summer, in the United States alone more than 800 children joined the pioneer ranks in singing Jehovah’s praises.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>REMAINING IN THIS BRANCH OF SERVICE</strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">24. In the face of what do pioneers prove their ministry? How well?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Increase in the ministry and on to the pioneer field will not be without tests, whether one is old or young, male or female. Forward advance will cause the “god of this world” to put increasing opposition in your path to impede your progress. Follow Paul’s advice and “watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of [your] ministry”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:5</a>) Thousands of pioneers throughout the earth are making full proof of their ministry in the face of obstacles and afflictions. Jehovah has so added the increase to their ranks that from 462, in 1922, there are now more than 12,000 pioneers serving full-time throughout the world. From these over 1,200 have been sent through the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead for advance missionary training equipping them to serve in foreign countries throughout the world. These have been sent to over 80 foreign countries with the life-giving message for all who will hear. In South America, for example, over the past five years, ministers for the new world have increased from 1,700 to now more than 5,000 reporting each month. This is an increase of more than 194 percent. Like increases in other parts of the world are attributed largely to the work of pioneer ministers; and yet still more and more pioneers are needed, for truly the harvest is great.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">25. What two great commandments do they fulfill? With what results?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>Jesus said that all the Law and the Prophets hung upon the two great commandments: love Jehovah with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and, second to this, love your neighbor as yourself. To go into a foreign assignment takes great faith and complete trust in God. Love for the Lord God and for one’s neighbor does not mean a selfish, emotional love, which results from false religious teachings. It means perfect expression of unselfishness. Pioneer ministers when going into foreign countries must express that kind of love. Hardships will be encountered, but by faithful endurance the fruits of our labors will bring joys far beyond expectations. Experiences related by missionaries testify to this fact. For instance, from the interior of the Philippine Islands we hear of native settlements with Jehovah’s witnesses in the majority. From the heart of Africa we hear of whole villages consisting of Jehovah’s witnesses, and in every country the number of witnesses enlarges. Actual reports now show over 300,000 ministers preaching at least part of the time during each month. Their congregations are neighbors living within their reach. Thus true love is expressed, not only to God in obedience to his command to preach, but also to their neighbors. So doing, these ministers guarantee salvation for themselves <span id="page108" class="pageNum" data-no="108" data-before-text="108"></span>and also for those who respond to the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">26. Despite world opinion, what may God’s ministers expect of him?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Truly Jehovah’s new world ministers, whether pioneers or otherwise, are a peculiar people. To God they are the apple of his eye. To the world, they are strange and are considered by many to be religious fanatics. But, regardless of what the world thinks of his servants, whom he out of mercy sends forth to sound a final warning, Jehovah will never forsake them. His eyes run to and fro throughout the earth to show himself strong in behalf of those who love him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">27. How may some argue as to maintenance in full-time service?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>What must one do after taking the steps into the pioneer field, to be assured of remaining in this branch of the service? In answer to this question let us consider, for example, the “Faithful and True Witness”, Jesus Christ. His actual course and abundant counsel give perfect instructions. ‘Well,’ you might say, ‘Jesus told us to consider the lilies of the field, how they neither toil nor make provision for the future, and yet Solomon in all his glory and with all his riches was not so adorned. Jesus also said to consider the birds and how the heavenly Father provides for them. And, further, he said to take no thought of the morrow, for sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. How can I stay in the pioneer work if I have such an attitude? This is the modern twentieth century, and we have to be practical about the high cost of living.’ To be sure, such questions of yours must be considered.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">28, 29. (a) How is faith regarding support in service a requirement? (b) How was this illustrated in Jesus’ own case?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>The first requirement for pioneers to consider is that of faith. Jesus surpassed us all in this quality. Without it it is impossible to please God. With it the servant’s mind and heart are in the right attitude for understanding and are quick to respond when enlightened. Jesus was a true servant, fired with a zeal that caused him to work at his Father’s service as did no other. He could not sit down and sway in the breeze just to be pleasing to the eyes of men and expect God to provide for him. That was not his purpose for being on the earth. The lilies, however, fulfilled their purpose, and for that reason God sustained them in their beauty. The birds of the air fulfilled their purpose and are also provided for. For Jesus to be sustained he must fulfill God’s purpose as it applied to him, namely, to bear witness to the truth in vindication of his Father’s sovereignty over all and to provide a ransom.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>Jesus fulfilled his commission perfectly and was sustained sufficiently throughout his earthly sojourn. For 33 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>years he lived as a human creature and his material needs were no less than any other human creature’s. As a young man he, no doubt, worked at the carpenter trade. At the age of thirty he devoted his full time to gospel-preaching. He had made no plans for marriage and the raising of children, but decided at an early age to serve his heavenly Father completely. When entering the full-time work he did not have to consider supporting a family. His faith was sufficient that he left his support completely at the disposal of his Father in heaven. By faithfully preaching he found that those who listened to him were in many cases willing and anxious for him to dine with them. In doing so Jesus imparted spiritual food far more valuable than the material food he consumed. He was not particular about his lodging for the night, but slept anywhere Jehovah provided, whether under the stars, in a stable, or in a home. He said: “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 8:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">30. By what will the full-time minister live and be fruitful?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>Today the same is possible for single persons who are without family and financial obligations and, above all, fired with a zeal for Jehovah similar to that of Jesus. Again we say, this does not mean you will have the conveniences and luxuries expected by members of this world. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of Jehovah. If you preach the gospel, you will live by the gospel, because the laborer is worthy of his hire. Many to whom you carry the water of life will count it a privilege and a service to the Lord God to provide you with food and drink. Accept it as God’s provision in meekness and with thanksgiving. When Jesus said of those who would hear, that ‘from their bellies would flow living waters of life’, he meant that the divine truth would be their first concern in life. They would bear fruit, and were likened by the apostle Paul to good ground that drinks in frequent showers of spiritual refreshment, and produces vegetation or Kingdom fruits which are of use to those for whom the ground is cultivated. Pioneers are cultivated by God for his work of advertising his Kingdom and warning of Armageddon.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">31. Why is this the special time to join the pioneer ranks?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>This is the acceptable time for you to join the pioneer ranks. Never was the need for them so great, nor the time so short and the harvest to be reaped so plentiful. If you have been called out of darkness into the marvelous light, reflect it to others before it is too late. The more time you spend in reflecting the light, the brighter your reflector becomes and the more brilliant your light, and the more are attracted to the truth. The day of Jehovah is far spent and the night of Armageddon is very near. Do not be caught napping and in a state of indifference toward those who are in bondage. Hear the call for more and more pioneers of good news. Feel the urgent need, and then respond!</p>

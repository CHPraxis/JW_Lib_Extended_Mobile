The Most Enjoyable Book
One of Jehovah’s witnesses employed as electrician at a department store in Dayton, Ohio, was asked by the editor of the store paper to write a brief report of about 100 words on the most enjoyable book he had read lately. He wrote the report, it was published, and favorable comment came from fellow workers. He placed many booklets on Bible topics. Several clergymen called to see the writer of the report, but lost interest and left when they learned from the editor that the writer was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The report has been reprinted in other papers. One of his fellow workers said that they were having trouble with their church minister constantly preaching politics from the pulpit, that a special meeting was called at which he read this book report, and then to the preacher this fellow worker said: “Look what an electrician can tell us for nothing, yet we pay you a big salary and get nothing but politics!” The book report that the witness of Jehovah had written follows:
“I will never finish reading this book in my lifetime. It begins by having a beautiful home destroyed by rebellion. Tragedy, disaster, sorrow, murder and death follow. As the family multiplies, the plunge into despair and darkness accelerates. Centuries roll by, nations rise and fall, thousands of characters pass in review, every human emotion from stark, raw hate to a martyr’s love is encountered. Hope, beginning as a faint spark, grows to absolute assurance. A perfect government is to re-establish the beautiful home. Its ruler is the King, Christ Jesus. The government, the Kingdom of God. The family, the human race. The book is the Bible!”

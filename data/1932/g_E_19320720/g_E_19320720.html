<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Jehovah God and the American Government</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font9">T WAS a tense moment, a situation unlike any other in history, when Judge Rutherford stepped to the microphone on the morning of June 26, 1932, to answer the question “Can the American Government Endure?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All intelligent persons of mature years know that the American Government as it was in the days of our fathers has ceased to exist. No one would be willing to say that what is functioning at Washington is “a government of the people, by the people, for the people”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It cannot be said that there is liberty in a land where 8,000,000 of the citizens are without employment and therefore without the means of life. In a natural paradise where there is too much of everything, too much coal, too much cotton, too much food, Big Business, by its unwisdom, has in a few short years made an end of liberty and brought serfdom to millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And it is unrepentant and unchastened in the face of the greatest follies ever laid at the door of any governing group. It now wants even the nominal restraints of the present laid aside and all power-placed in its hands, regardless of law, reason or consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span><span class="font9"> magazine, in its June (1932) issue, contains an article by its editors entitled, “Wanted: a Dictator!” It is a magazine that circulates among the wealthy and makes its appeal to that class. The concluding paragraph in that article is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this country, Congress has failed utterly to meet the test. Representative government has collapsed before the clamor of special interests. The American people can give no mandate before November, and the situation is critical. We must declare an immediate truce on party politics and create, legally or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">illegally,</span><span class="font8"> an emergency organization, if the executive power is to rescue the national finances and the national credit from the nerveless hands of a lobby-ridden Congress. The alternative is chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This Big Business crowd that has taken the government and the wealth of the nation out of the hands of the people and put it in their own hands, and that now brazenly proposes a dictatorship to make its rule absolute, is exposed by Judge Rutherford in what is believed by his friends to be the strongest address he ever made. It is featured in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Judge Rutherford gave this address official Washington, guiltily conscious of this dictatorship conspiracy in process of forming, was and is terrified by the presence within its gates of 45,000 World War veterans who have come, so they say, to stay until they get their adjusted compensation, and more are on the way. They want $2,400,000,000, so they say, and want it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As he stepped to the microphone there were many officials in Washington and elsewhere who no doubt hoped that the judge would call for a revolution, so that they could release against him and against these veterans all the powers which have been reserved for just such an occasion. How astonished they must have been when they heard him give counsel in exactly the opposite direction! Judge Rutherford’s only appeal is to the Word of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But what Judge Rutherford had to say to official Washington was of a great deal more consequence to them than if he had called for a revolution and had gained the objective, for in recent years there have been revolutions in many lands, and counter-revolutions. These are events of minor importance. The adverse judgment of Almighty God against any institution of man means its final and complete annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And that is the message Judge Rutherford had to give. It seemed like the inaugural address of the New Government, the setting aside of the old and the proclamation of the new. It was delivered under circumstances befitting the dignity of earth's new King. Forty selected radio stations from Maine to Texas carried the message to millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Headquarters were opened at 1603 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Washington, D.C., in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">heart of the embassy district, a proper place for the work in hand. Special courtesies were shown to the president of the United States, the members of his cabinet, United States senators and representatives. When incumbents of office will be leaving shortly, the least one can do is to be courteous to them, and kind. Even an executioner need not be rude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At first there was some confusion on the part of Washington's officials, as would be natural Under the circumstances. In one instance a navy official demanded that the work of preparation for the broadcast be stopped and the Society’s representative come to see him immediately. When inquiry was made as to who was talking he replied, “The Government”; and not until the second inquiry, “What government?” he did not seem to know that there is any other government than that of the United States. He was informed of Jehovah’s government, and told that ‘he could find its representatives at any time; meantime, we stand on our rights, and on our instructions from Jehovah God’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In any business enterprise, when the board of directors decides to oust the old administration and put in one entirely new, the old one always hates to go, but go it must. Whether its record is good or bad, it must go. What it has done or not done is merely a matter of history. No attention is paid to its protests of what it ‘will do if allowed to remain’. It is like that with the government at Washington, and with all the governments of earth. They must go; their time is up; their fate is sealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Illegal clamorings for a dictatorship, such as proposed by Owen D. Young, chairman of the board of directors of the General Electric Company, and by the editors of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair,</span><span class="font9"> will do no good. Nor, on the other hand, is it necessary to lock up the men who have advocated these illegalities. Jehovah God has a better way, and His way will succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even the most elementary student of the Scriptures knows that a time conies when God's kingdom, ‘the stone cut out of the mountain without hands,’ comes into power in the earth, and while previous governments are still functioning. The statement is that this “kingdom which shall never be destroyed’’ “shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever”, (Daniel 2:44,45) That time has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is no disgrace to be living at the time when God’s kingdom comes into power. On the other hand, it is a great privilege and a great blessing to those who are willing to submit to the sway of the new King. But whether men choose to submit willingly or not, submit they must. If they submit willingly they may live; if they submit unwillingly they die; and Jehovah God has pronounced the decree, not in a corner, but publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On June 26, 1932, He used Judge Rutherford to declare His righteous judgment on the government at Washington, but not that government alone. Britain must go; it may not forever keep 50,000 political prisoners in the. vermin-infested jails of India; nor may it forever betray the people of Egypt and of those to whom Balfour gave his word of honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">France must go; it may not forever maintain its Devil's Island off the coast of Guinea, or hold the world in terror of its airplane squadrons and savage soldiers from Africa. Italy must go; Mussolini may not forever ridicule the lovers of liberty and hold in the Liparis, under conditions worse than death, the few in his realm that dare to use their reasoning faculties. The black shirts are the skulls and crossbones of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Poland must go; not for always may it, in its prisons, assault the helpless, beat them black and blue, and compel them to take their food from the same containers in which they ease themselves. Germany must go; God will not hold her guiltless for the treatment accorded His witnesses within her borders. And she still nourishes militarism in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hungary must go; its treatment of its prisoners has been almost as bad as that of Poland. Russia must go; the entire land is one vast prison from which, if one attempts to escape, his life is the forfeit. And who would wish to save the government of Japan, or any other of the governments that have filled the world with terror and with sorrow?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the face of what has happened and what is happening at Geneva, what interest can God or man have in any of these institutions that are backed up by battleships, Big Berthas, machine guns, flame throwers, poison gas, chaplains and diplomats, except to wish their speedy end, and the establishment of the better order for which Jesus taught us to pray, ‘Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is of that Kingdom, not a dream, but an actuality, that Judge Rutherford, as the mouthpiece of Jehovah God, spoke so plainly, so forcefully and so kindly, June 26, 1932. Will the rulers hear and live, or will they refuse to hear, and receive destruction at the hands of Almighty God? It matters not; God will have His way and will grant deliverance to all whose hearts turn toward Him in this fateful hour. In the end such will say, ‘Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘'And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 0 house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.” (Isaiah 2:2-5) Judge Rutherford’s address June 26, 1932, is an invitation to all the world to come into this Kingdom. They may come or be destroyed, and the decision is with them. ‘'Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!” Each must decide for himself. None may decide for another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All our readers will be interested to know of the circumstances attending the announcement and delivery of this climacteric proclamation. What was done at Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font9"> What were some of the outstanding incidents? Was the work done openly and courageously, or stealthily and furtively? Read the report of Anton Koerber to the president of the Society. It speaks for' itself. (See page 654.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A unique feature of publicity for the broadcast was that one-minute announcements were made frequently from two hundred stations during three days preceding the address date. Each station giving the announcements made mention of one or more stations that could be heard in that certain locality during the chain hour. And there was other publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the broadcast Judge Rutherford was deluged with telegrams and subsequently with thousands of letters of appreciation from all over the United States and Canada east of the Rocky mountains. Believing that many of our readers will appreciate seeing some of these, we reproduce a few of them elsewhere in this issue. The address itself begins on page 647.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Hints of a Dictatorship</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">(Confirmations, in the day’s news, of the aecuiaey of Judge Rutherford's findings in the epoch-making address reported in full, beginning on page 647.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">H</span><span class="font9">AVING ruined the country Big Business is now clamoring for a dictator and has its speakers out getting things lined up with that in view. In an address before the Rotary club of Fort Myers, Fla., Rev. O. T. Anderson quoted a statement by Owen D. Young pointing to what he considers an existing necessity for a dictator in America, and himself added: “What we have is an impasse—or a vicious circle. The manufacturer or producer is in no mood to open his mills for fear he will have no market for his products. But he can have no market until the buying public gets a job and has money with which to buy. If a dictator should step in tomorrow and order every wheel of industry to start turning next Monday and every unemployed man to report for work at a living wage (I do not say at labor union wages) we should be well out of this impasse inside of 60 days.” How perfectly this backs up what Judge Rutherford said in his great speech over the hookup Sunday morning, June 26, on the theme, “Can the American Government Endure ?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">PLAN is afoot to control the purchases of the small business man, and make him pay interest on everything from the start. This plan, which, if adopted, will be a financial dictatorship, is said to have the approval of the heads of General Motors, Standard Oil, Bethlehem Steel, General Electric and U. S. Steel. Hints that a virtual dictatorship would soon be in effect in America have frequently come from Washington of late. It is held that the president needs an advisory council to assist him, a supergovernment.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Where the Power Resides</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font9">HE New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font9"> says, comically but truthfully: “The early Americans, throwing off the power of the English kings, thought they could arrange a plan under which power would be located nowhere in particular. They were mistaken. Power always goes somewhere, and here it has gone to organized finance. The president of the United States can take it away and exercise it himself whenever he chooses.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Coming Events at Washington</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font9">F COMING events cast their shadows before, one instinctively wonders what it means to have an army of several thousand ex-soldiers permanently encamped at the capital, waiting, so they say, until they get their bonus money. The police say they do not think it wise for them to handle them roughly, the men say they won't go home until they get what is coming to them, and it is doubtful if the regular army would fire on them even if they were given the command.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“A </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cry to Save the Government”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">E</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dward F. McGrady, legislative representative of the American Federation of Labor, testifying on relief legislation before the Senate Manufactures Committee, made the statement that “the president and Congress must realize that conditions are not going to get better, but that they will get worse”; and said that if relief is not afforded the unemployed next winter “it will be a cry to save the government”. Meantime, the railroads have been helped up to as high as $27,500,000 at one crack.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>“A Gangster-Ridden Country”</span></h4>

<p><span class="font8">We are a gangster-ridden country. There is no doubt about that. We can pooh-pooh the idea or resent it all we please—we are gangster-ridden, gangster-controlled. There are all types of gangsters. Some of them would become really excited should you call them gangsters; they do not consider themselves gangsters. Some of them occupy high places in churches, pass contribution plates, teach Sunday school classes, fill offices in chambers of commerce and other trade bodies; some have titles of “Honorable”; yet they are gangsters. Any man is a gangster who is part of an organized group deliberately and wilfully exploiting the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font9">CHICAGO a gangster threatened a judge and prosecuting attorney with death by machine gun unless they dismissed a charge of bank robbery which they had against him, and the judge signed the order dismissing the case. But hardly a week goes by but that some “brave” Jersey policeman, in Bergenfield or Westfield, or elsewhere, arrests some mild, defenseless Christian man or woman, one of Jehovah's witnesses, for going from door to door, comforting the people in the Scriptures and seeking to place in their hands the message of God’s kingdom as the only hope for the world. And when it comes to the “brave” judge he boldly repudiates the law of God, the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New Jersey, and sings out, “Ten dollars or ten days.” Is it any wonder ruin is at the door?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Can the American Government Endure?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">[Chain Broadcast from New York June 26, 1932, by Judge Rutherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font9">OR more than a hundred years America has stood in the very foremost rank of the governments of the earth. In natural resources America is today the richest country under the sun. The United States and Britain constitute the two pillars of the great seventh world power and which power is described in divine prophecy as the double or twofold government. Both nations claim to be Christian, and they form the chief part of the realm called ‘‘Christendom<sup>-</sup>’, but, in fact, Satan is their invisible ruler and god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The founders of the American nation desired greater freedom than they possessed. That they might be free and independent of cruel and oppressive rulers they fled from Europe and established the American republic, to which nation men have long pointed with pride. When the nation was young many of her statesmen were patriots, because they loved their fellow men and honestly and valiantly contended for a just government. Today there is no true patriotism among the rulers of the nation. It is now impossible for the people to elect men to public office and to expect them to enact just laws and to administer the affairs of the government for the general welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The three visible elements of men that rule the nation are, to wit, the commercial, the political, and the religious, and of these three the commercial is the most powerful. Among the earlier statesmen of America there were some God-fearing men who foresaw the advance of a mighty and selfish power and gave warning that the greedy would some day destroy the liberties of the people. That warning was unheeded, and the selfish, commercial element, which is otherwise called “Big Business”, has stealthily and constantly moved forward to its goal. With grasping arms like the tentacles of a mighty octopus it has laid hold upon practically all of the visible wealth of the nation. At the same time the men who by laborious efforts have developed the country and produced the wealth of the land have been unjustly treated and robbed, and today they are crying for bread, and that in a land of boundless plenty. Many Americans in sorrowful tones are now asking the question: “Can the nation of America long endure while such unjust conditions exist</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Business has no regard for the rights of the common people. The Civil War of 1863 was fomented and carried forward for the purpose of creating a condition by which Big Business could obtain a strangle hold upon the nation. To free the land from the traffic of human flesh and blood was the ostensible reason for that war, but the real reason was to enable a selfish company to control the finances and all the business interests of the nation. In 1917 Big Business, for ultrasellish reasons, needlessly and wantonly forced the American nation into the World War, which resulted in the greatly increased wealth and power of a few men and made serfs and paupers of many millions of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today Big Business owns practically everything visible. By the manipulation of the finances of the nation Big Business has acquired title to almost all of the real estate, while hundreds of thousands of honest toilers are losing their homes and their land. A few ultrarich men fix the prices of the food produced by the farmers, and which food products are reaped down by laborers, and by reason thereof the farmers are robbed and the laborers are caused to starve, and that within the borders of the richest nation of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Business owns the ships that ply the seas, and that fly through the air. It owns and controls the railways and other ways and means of transportation. Big Business has acquired the preferred securities of the public carrier corporations, while some of the common people hold the less desirable stocks and securities. When the railways were recently pressed for money to pay the interest on their preferred securities Big Business caused the American government to advance a hundred million dollars to the banks upon the pretext of helping the banks to thaw out their frozen assets and to stimulate business immediately, but instead of so using that money Big Business immediately absorbed the entire hundred million and applied it to the payment of interest on the preferred securities which it held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Business, which is composed of a very few men, owns and controls the telegraph and telephone lines, the radio, the electric and power lines, and it owns and controls the mines that produce the fuel and the building material which all the people are compelled to use. It owns and controls the banks and most of the money that is in them. It is in possession of the greater portion of the gold that rightfully belongs to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the government. The factories and the great mercantile establishments are owned and controlled by the same selfish interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Business has in its employ the most astute lawyers of the nation, who write the contracts always in the interest of their clients, and the common people must take the ragged end. Every branch of the government is contaminated and improperly influenced by Big Business. It controls the two major political parties of America and names and elects at will the public men to office who will best serve its selfish interests. Big Business controls the army and the navy, the guns and the ammunition, and the police power of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Practically all of the business corporations of America are owned or controlled by Big Business. The employees of these mighty corporations have a hook in their nose, so to speak, and they dare not call themselves their own. They must obey the selfish men who are the mighty lords of finance or else lose their jobs. They need their salaries to feed and clothe themselves and their families; hence they are at the mercy of Big Business and are therefore serfs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Business either directly or indirectly owns or controls almost all of the newspapers and magazines of America, and which agencies serve as propagandists for Big Business and their immediate political and religious allies. The same selfish interests own and control the professional clergymen, and these men make merchandise of the Word of God in order to keep the people in ignorance and in subjection to the ruling powers. Thus it is plainly seen that the power of the government is centralized in the hands of a very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In times past statesmen have warned the people of the danger that would result from the centralization of power in the hands of a few men. While the people have heard this warning, and many of them have sensed the advancing danger, they have been helpless to prevent what has come to pass. Today the common people are bound hand and foot. In 1917 the predatory element that rules the nation created the slogan, “The w<sup>r</sup>ar will make the world safe for democracy,” and then caused its propaganda press and its hypocritical clergymen to sound this false slogan throughout the land. Now after fourteen years democracy has disappeared from the earth. There is at this very time a concerted movement by those few men who control the commerce of the land to have America ruled by a dictator, which means the setting aside of all constitutional law and the putting into force such orders as the dictator may deem necessary. The public press has been instructed to diplomatically educate the people as to the necessity of a dictator before that step is actually taken and the dictatorial power disclosed. You have observed recently in the metropolitan press statements couched in guarded phrase advocating a dictator in America to control the affairs of the nation. From one of the well known magazines, dated June 25, 1932, I quote these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What could be done by a dictator with powers of a military nature? He would first make every possible effort to increase the confidence of men of affairs in the future of the country, to make </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">business men</span><span class="font8"> everywhere realize that the government intended to encourage, assist, and protect </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">them</span><span class="font8"> in every possible effort they might make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is a brazen statement made in the interest of the few and against the common welfare of the many. Big Business maintains paid lobbyists at Washington, which lobbyists conduct also a bureau of information for the special benefit of their employers. Each week a letter goes from that bureau of information to the executive heads of Big Business corporations. From one of these communications, dated May 14 last, I quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is beginning to be apparent that some substitute for a coalition government will have to be formed to handle the situation after adjournment of Congress. . . . There are several plans, but one revolves about the idea of assembling in Washington, or subject to quick call, a group of a dozen or more men. . . . Dictatorship, which is being advocated more from week to week, would be avoided, but some of the practical merits of dictatorship would be obtained. At least this is the hope behind the idea, which is an adaptation of the set-up represented by the war-time Council of National Defense. . . . One practical objection is that the public might be-unduly alarmed by implications in the summoning of a council of advisers. . . . We have reason for believing the plan will materialize, and we advise you [executive business heads] in advance to consider it a good sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The information is provided for only corporation executives, and not intended for publication. These secret communications disclose in advance the action that Congress will take, what bills it will pass, and what it will not pass; and by watching the public press it is seen that these predictions come true.. This is one of the evidences that men elected to public office represent the predatory interests and not the common people. This and other facts show that the rulers are greatly perplexed and proceeding with much fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am not taking sides in politics. I am merely calling attention to the facts, that I may in a moment cite Jehovah God’s prophecy applying at this very hour and which discloses the cause of the present trouble and what is the only possible remedy. In the language of the second Psalm of the Bible I ask the powers at Washington to give heed to the Word of Jehovah God and be wise. L ike wise I ask the people to hear and give consideration to what the Word of God has to say on this matter, because under the rulership of a dictator the opportunity to use the radio to tell you of the great truths of God's Word, which are now vital to all, may cease for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In recent months Jehovah’s witnesses by radio and by calling at the homes of the people have repeatedly directed attention to the Bible testimony which shows that Jehovah God foretold the present distress and perplexity that is now upon the world, and the cause, and what will be the result. Their only purpose in so doing has been and is to inform the people for their own well being, in obedience to Jehovah’s command. (Isa. 43: 9-12; 6:1-11) Their efforts to thus inform the people of the truth, which is vital to be understood at this time, have been bitterly opposed by the hired clergymen, who have also enlisted the cooperation of the police power to keep the people in ignorance. Now as I have opportunity, I plead with the rulers and with the people to hear the voice of Jehovah God as set down in the Bible centuries ago, foretelling these conditions and pointing out the way of escape. Whether you do take heed or not, the responsibility is yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well do you know that fear has laid hold upon almost everyone. You see this manifested by government officials, bank officials and employees, by business men and farmers, by professional politicians, clergymen and the common people. Why is there such great fear and perplexity amongst the rulers, and distress amongst the people everywhere? Jehovah God’s Word at Luke, chapter twenty-one, states that this very time of crisis would come upon the world, and that when it arrived there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . . men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken’’. “The powers of heaven” means Satan’s invisible organization, the members of which know the great crisis is here. What is the cause of this fear and perplexity, and which the public press designates “lack of confidence” ? The Word of Jehovah God answers the question in plain phrase. Then why not let the people know what that answer is ? Because Satan the invisible ruler of this wicked world wishes to keep the people in ignorance of and away from Jehovah, and to do this Jehovah’s witnesses are put in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Men of Big Business and their “strong-arm squad” are reprehensible before God for hindering the witnesses of Jehovah in telling the people the truth, but the clergymen are far more reprehensible and responsible, because these “gentlemen of the cloth” have held themselves out as teachers of the Bible, thereby misleading the people, and have refused to teach the people the Bible themselves, and they oppose others who do teach it. Why then has this terrible condition of distress and perplexity come upon the world at this time, including the fair land of America? Jehovah’s Word at Revelation, chapter twelve, answers: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Satan’s world ended in 1914, that point being marked by the beginning of the World War. Satan, as Jehovah had foretold, was then cast out of the heaven, and from that time forward it is but a short time until the final destruction of his organization, and until the full and complete establishment of Jehovah's government of right-eousess. Never was there a truth so important as this for the people to know and to learn now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of this world. He has blinded men to the truth and has subtly influenced others to do his bidding. Satan is the author and organizer of the cruel and oppressive commercial Big Business system that rules the world. He has used commerce, politics and religion that he might get complete control of the human race and defame the name and word of Jehovah God. For this reason, it is written in the Bible (1 John 5:19), ‘The whole world is now under the wicked one.’ It is also stated (2 Cor. 4:4) that Satan is the god or invisible ruler of this world, and the one who blinds the people to the truth. He uses various instruments to accomplish this purpose. Satan, knowing that the time approaches when he must make his last stand, is now desperately trying to stampede every creature into his own camp and into a position against Jehovah and His kingdom. Within a short time Jehovah God will destroy the Devil and his entire organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But why did not God destroy Satan the Devil long ago, and thus prevent so much wickedness in the earth ? Bear with me, please, while I give the Scriptural answer. When Satan beheld the perfect man and woman at Eden, and knew that they were endowed with power to multiply and fill the eqrth, commerce had its birth in his selfish mind. He saw that in the future, with the human race in his power, he could build a mighty machine of commerce, politics and false religion, and thereby gain control of the people and defame the name of Jehovah God and make himself, Satan, the most important one. For this reason he challenged Jehovah God to put on earth men that would remain true to Him under adverse conditions. Had Jehovah refused this challenge and immediately destroyed Satan there would not have been an opportunity afforded to prove to all creation that Jehovah God is the Supreme One, that He is the Giver of life and all other blessings, and that His name is above all and worthy of praise. Jehovah accepted the challenge and permitted Satan to proceed in his effort to prove his boast. At the same time Jehovah informed Satan and man that when the due time should arrive Jehovah God will destrov Satan and all of his works. (Gen. 3:15-17; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8; see </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font9"> Book Two) Satan’s first world power was commercial and military Egypt. Jehovah sent His chosen people the Israelites to sojourn in that land. The Egyptian government oppressed God's people. In due time and after full warning to the Egyptian rulers Jehovah delivered His people from that land of oppression and destroyed the Egyptian rulers. The Scriptures plainly point out that such was an illustration of what Jehovah God will shortly do to Satan and his entire organization that rules the world. Pharaoh the king of Egypt pictured Satan the Devil, and the Egyptian nation pictured or foreshadowed the present nations of the world; while the Israelites pictured the order-loving people who desire to be-on the side of God and righteousness. Now in the language of the Scriptures I answer the question specifically as to why Jehovah God has permitted Satan and his wicked workers to exist for such a long period of time, and which answer God caused Moses to write, at Exodus 9:1G </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Leese r),</span><span class="font9"> to wit: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” To for ever settle the question of supremacy Jehovah has permitted Satan to go on in wickedness until due time to destroy him and his wicked organization and thus prove that Jehovah is the supreme and eternal God. That time of crisis has now arrived, and Jehovah’s witnesses are proclaiming his name throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is the Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of life. All His ways are just and righteous, and no one can enjoy the blessings of eternal life and happiness except at the hands of Jehovah. The name of Jehovah God is most important of all. His name has for centuries been defamed. The time has come to vindicate His name, and to place in the minds of the people the proper understanding and appreciation of His name. The defamation of God’s name has been brought about by Satan and his great commercial organization, aided and abetted by the political power, acting in conjunction with the false and hypocritical religious leaders who falsely charge Jehovah God with responsibility for human suffering. Satan’s organization oppresses the people, and at the same time the preachers or clergymen tell the people that the nation of America and other like nations rule by divine right, are Christian nations, and hence exercise power in harmony with the will of God. For this, amongst other reasons, the clergy, while claiming to represent God, in fact represent the Devil and his organization. In order that the people might hear the truth and determine this matter for themselves, recently I challenged the combined clergy of America to select their best man to debate this question by radio. Charged with misrepresenting God and serving Satan these gentlemen should either come forward and prove the falsity of the charge or. failing in that, should cease to hold themselves out as teachers of the Word of God. Jehovah foretold the outcome of such a challenge and the attitude that would be assumed by the preachers, when He caused His prophet Jeremiah to write, at chapter fifty-one, verse thirty: “The mighty men of Babylon [Satan's organization] have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed.&quot;’ Let the people take note of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The greatest crisis of the ages is now upon the world, and this includes the American government. The power of Satan's earthly government is now centralized in the hands of a few. Seeing that a great crisis is at hand, even these rulers are in great fear and perplexity; hence they evolve and announce many schemes. But no such schemes can pull the nation out of the present dilemma. The rulers have been duly informed and duly warned that Jehovah God's kingdom is here. They have refused to give heed. They disregard the Word of God and go on with their imperfect schemes, and will continue to try one after another, all of which shall fail. I venture the opinion that before the end of the year the American government will be ruled by a dictator, aided by a company of advisers that are selected and directed by the chiefs of Big Business. Such will be a military rule and one which the people will be compelled to submit to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1917 millions of young men were forced into the military ranks at the instance of Big Business. The lifeblood of more than a hundred thousand of these was spilled upon the soil of France in violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant. Other thousands, returning to America, found themselves without a job and with no means of support for themselves and their families. And now after fourteen years thousands of those war veterans march to Washington and beg the government to feed them and their starving children. They ask for bread and receive a stone; they petition for meat and receive a deadly serpent. Many are now’ asking: “Can the American government long endure under such conditions ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Would a revolution relieve the people and pull the nation out of its present dilemma ? I answer most emphatically, No. There is no man in America that could lead successfully a revolution. To undertake it would be worse than folly. Satan has seen to it that the power of the nation is centralized in Big Business and its allies. The army and the navy and the “strong-arm squad” will do the bidding of Big Business, and the people are powerless before them. A revolution ■would be a dismal failure and would accomplish no good results. Let thoughtful people who believe in what is right refrain from advocating revolution and abstain from all violence. No person who believes and serves Jehovah God will resort to violence. This is Jehovah’s fight.—2 Chron. 20:15; 2 Cor. 10: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shall the cruel and oppressive commercial power selfishly and wantonly continue to rule without limit ? What shall the people do for relief? I strongly appeal to you to be calm and learn what Jehovah God has provided for relief and deliverance. By His Word the great Jehovah now speaks to the rich and oppressive ones who rule behind the throne of visible power, and says to them, as recorded in James 5: 1,2: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.” How true is that statement of the Lord’s Word applied at this day. With all their wealth they are in fear and in perplexity, and they weep and howl because of the miseries that have now come upon them. They have the money, but they do not know what to do with it. Further addressing them Jehovah says (Jas. 5:3): “Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.” Heretofore I have pointed out from the Bible that we are now in the last days of Satan’s rule and that God’s kingdom is at hand. The millions of people who once produced the wealth that others now have, and who are now’ without employment and without money, are crying for help. They are not crying to God, because the agents of Satan have kept them blind concerning the truth of God. They are crying because they have been robbed and defrauded, and their burdens are unbearable. Yet Jehovah hears their cries, even as He heard the cries of the oppressed in Egypt, and now further addressing the oppressors He says (Jas. 5:4, 5): “Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped [and have fought your battles] are entered into the ears of the Lord of [Battle]. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been Avanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The invisible and visible armies of Satan and of Jehovah God are assembled now at Armageddon. Satan’s chief field marshal is called “Gog” and is the one who commands the host of devils invisible and the powerful visible organization that is on the earth and under the hand of Satan. Jehovah's chief field marshal is Christ Jesus, who leads and will lead the fight against the enemy. He is supported by legions of glorious spirit creatures that are invisible to man; while on earth there is just a little handful of men whom He uses, not to fight with carnal weapons, but to bear testimony and inform the people of what is coming and to point them to Jehovah God’s kingdom that will be their relief. Already Satan and his wicked forces under Gog, both invisible and visible, have formed a conspiracy and have begun the committing of overt acts against the faithful witnesses of Jehovah. The day rapidly approaches for the great conflict, and Jehovah God says to the enemy forces, as stated in the prophecy of Ezekiel: ‘I am against you and all your organization, and I will destroy you.’ (Chapters 38 and 39; see </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font9"> Book Two) Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated and all creation shall know that He is The God. Hence Satan and his entire organization must fall, and that includes the American government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people who are oppressed are powerless to deliver themselves, and they continue to cry. Some have assumed leadership amongst the people, and these advocate various schemes of relief, amongst which are communism, revolution and other deeds of violence. Their homes have been swept away from them. They have been robbed of their earnings. They are without employment and they see their children starving, and they have become desperate. Jehovah God by His prophet now<sup>7</sup> addresses them and tells them to stand still and watch what He shall do. (2 Chron. 20:15) He says, at Zephaniah 3:8: “Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” Jehovah is the God of Battle, and, the time having arrived for the vindication of His name, He will fight the battle of Armageddon for His own name’s sake; and it will result in the complete destruction of oppressive powers and the deliverance of the people. There is no need to seek for or look for any other way out of the dilemma, because there is none other. Those who love God would not wish to find any other, because they know what Jehovah does is done right and in the interest of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the information of those who love God and w’ho would know Him and His righteous way, He has caused to be recorded in the Bible illustrations of the great and final battle now approaching and during which the nations of this earth shall fall. The eighty-third Psalm describes the enemy’s organization under Satan led into action by his chief officer Gog. The psalmist then, as Jehovah’s faithful representative, says (Psalm 83:2,3,5,9): “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee. Do unto them as unto the Midian-ites; as to Sisera.” Satan’s organization is described here under the names of Midianites and Sisera; and concerning the battle in which Sisera was destroyed it is said, in Judges 5:20: “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.” The “stars” picture the invisible army of Jehovah God, which army will do the destructive work at Armageddon, and against which Big Business and all military powers of earth can do no hurt. Christ Jesus, in Matthew, chapter twenty-four, describes that battle as the worst trouble that will have ever afflicted the world and that it shall be the last. That battle is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The responsibility of nations before God is in proportion to the light and favorable opportunities afforded those nations to learn righteousness and deal justly. America and Britain are the leading nations of the realm called “Christendom”. The light and favor of Jehovah has been greatest to them, and hence responsibility is far greater upon these than upon any other nations of the earth. There has been more hypocrisy practiced and more blood unrighteously shed in these nations than in any other under the sun. Why will Jehovah destroy these nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible answers: Jerusalem was a type of “Christendom”. It was in Jerusalem that Jesus, the Son of Jehovah God, was foully murdered and His disciples persecuted to death. Jeru-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">JCL. 20, 1932 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tfc &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>E</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">653</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">salem was completely destroyed. During the World War it was the seventh world power that led in the persecution of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. It is in America that Jehovah's witnesses are now cruelly persecuted because they insist upon informing the people of God’s kingdom, which is the only hope for human relief. This persecution of Jehovah's witnesses is led by the clergymen, the same class of men that persecuted Jesus to death. If Jesus were to walk into Washington today and mingle with the suffering veterans in their camp He would be denounced by the clergymen as a man of low’ civilization. It is this same class of clergymen and political lobbyists that recently adopted a resolution, which appears in the Washington </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font9"> under date of June 10, 1932, declaring that Christ Jesus belongs to a low’er civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Scriptures use the v’ord ‘'inhabitants'’ as applying to the rulers who have ruled the earth as Satan’s representatives. In Isaiah (24:5,6) Jehovah says: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants [rulers] thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dw’ell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants [rulers] of the earth are burned, and few’ men left.” That means that the present unrighteous rule of this earth shall cease by the hand of Jehovah; and the greatest trouble W’ill be upon “Christendom”, w’hich includes America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This speech is not made to disturb the people, but to inform them that there is hope of complete relief in Jehovah’s provision. If you believe that the Bible is God’s Word, then study it in the light of present-day events. Send a card to Watch Tower, Brooklyn, N. Y., requesting a full text of this speech and you w’ill receive it free of charge, and it will enable you to better study the Bible. This speech is not made as a warning to the rulers. They have already received notice of the approaching w’orld storm, and instead of giving heed thereto they go on with their abortive schemes. Concerning this, Jehovah, at Psalm 82: 5, says: “They know’ not, neither will they understand: they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But why do I state that complete relief will follow<sup>7</sup> the downfall of “Christendom”, including the American government? I answer, Because Jehovah God says so. In Zephaniah 3: 8 He declares His purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, and then, in verse nine, says: “For then [after the destruction] will I turn to the people a pure language [of counsel and advice], that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” All shall then know that Jehovah is the Supreme God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the nations of the earth, and Satan is the greatest enemy of God and of man. Satan has caused the people and the rulers to be blinded to the truth. God has not heretofore interfered with his wicked w’ork, but now the time has come w’hen Jehovah will interfere and will destroy Satan and his organization and vindicate His name. The w’orld henceforth shall be ruled by His righteous Son Christ Jesus. That government shall be upon His shoulders, and of the peace and prosperity thereof there shall be no end. (Isa. 9:6, 7) Then the people will know the truth, and, as God’s Word declares, the people shall say: ‘Come, let us go up and put ourselves under the government of the Lord, and He w’ill teach us the right wav’; and then they w<sup>7</sup>ill cease from war and strife and dwell in peace for ever.—Isa. 2: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah made this earth for man to live upon in peace and plenty, health and happiness; and under the reign of Christ, He declares, the earth shall yield her increase and God shall bless the people, and all in the earth shall know Him. (Ps. 67:7) Christ is the invisible Ruler of the new<sup>7</sup> world, but He w’ill have on earth true and faithful men who will honestly and faithfully carry out His orders. Those men have already proven their faithful devotion to God. Some of them are named in the eleventh chapter of Hebrew’s; and in the forty-fifth Psalm the Lord declares they shall be the rulers in all the earth. In Isaiah 32:1 it is w’ritten: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in [justice].” The duty and obligation laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth is to bring this information to the attention of the people. They are not seeking or expecting personal gain or the approval of men. They are jovfullv obeying the commandments of Jehovah God. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the Word of Jehovah I specifically answer the question “Can the American government endure?” And that answer is emphatically, No! The terrible suffering, distress and unrighteousness now’ prevailing in this land of plenty should be sufficient cause for sober-minded persons to consider the reason and the remedy therefor, and all of which information is clearly set forth in the Bible. Those who will escape and be brought through to safety in this approaching time of greater trouble will be those who heed His Word and who take their stand on the side of Jehovah, because He so states, in Zephaniah 2: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses are your friends because they bring to you the information of how you may receive complete relief. We should expect Satan and his agents to do everything possible to prevent this information from getting to you; and that is exactly what they are doing. For your own sake, and that you might know the way that leads to life, peace and happiness, I plead with you in this hour of great crisis to study the Word of God. All efforts put forth by men or earthly organizations of men to relieve the people must fail, and the great trouble upon the world must come, because Jehovah God has decreed it so. When the wicked, cruel and oppressive organization of Satan has ceased to exist, and when you see and experience the righteous government of the world under Christ, the Prince of Peace, and the blessings that flow from that just rule, you will forget the distress that you now have, and you will rejoice and give praise to Him who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The American government has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. It cannot endure. Together with all other nations, it soon shall fall. Such fall will be in spite of everything Big Business, politicians and clergymen, the military and the “strong-arm squad”, and the Devil and all of his hosts can do to hold together the oppressive rule. It must and will fall because Jehovah God’s kingdom is here. Hasten now<sup>T</sup> to take shelter under Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under the righteous rule of Jehovah’s kingdom you will enjoy the fruits of your labor. Your wives and your babies will be housed and fed, and you will dwell in peace and happiness and health upon the earth for evermore. (Mic. 4: 2-4) I bid you, therefore, to be calm, refrain from violence, trust in Jehovah God, and wait for the salvation and peace and endless joy that His kingdom will bring to the now suffering millions who are obedient to Him. The kingdom of God is solely your hope. Your greatest Friend is JEHOVAH GOD.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">June 27, 1932 The President, Honorable J. F. Rutherford, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah has dealt bountifully with us, and every one who has had any part in the campaign here at Washington in preparation for the Lord's message over the air on June 2G is rejoicing. Following is a condensed report of some of the happenings in which I believe you will be most interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ralph arrived with radio equipment Wednesday. Apparently we were blocked at everything we attempted, by the police, the government, and the Electric Power Company, but by the Lord’s grace all this was overruled in a wonderful manner, and by Friday we were broadcasting. The authorities attempted to interfere, but the veterans set several guards over the equipment and the police and power company did not have a chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That night Brigadier General Glassford, head of the police department (who had previously during the day sought to prevent us from putting up the equipment), issued orders not to let anyone go into the camp; and at the same time issued orders for the veterans to leave the camp, upon threat that they would not furnish any more food rations. The veterans said they would stay, and told the police to keep their hands off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Friday night the Lord had an organization functioning here in preparation to serve notice of Jehovah's message on June 26 to every government official and employee in the ten governmental offices, as well as those in the Senate and House office buildings on Saturday morning. Exactly 300 of Jehovah’s witnesses went into action at 8:45 a.m., at which time the government employees and officials entered their offices. Arrangements were made and timed so that every man would have a certain portion of a building to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the fireworks began. Jehovah's witnesses poured into the buildings and placed the notice before them before they knew what had happened. By ten o’clock, however, the alaim had spread by the officials to other buildings, and their guards and policemen were waiting for them. But every man went ahead and carried out the commands given, regardless. So while the guards were holding a few for the police the others finished the building. In some of the buildings it seems the officials had taken special precautions against such an attack on their building, and when Jehovah's witnesses boldly walked past the guards into their offices they jumped up and cried for the guard and police. Others ran through the corridors crying ‘•The place is taken, the place is taken; call the guards!” Finally some of the guards learned they were Jehovah's witnesses and quieted the people, while other guards were very abusive, denouncing Jehovah and all His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A number of varied experiences were had which can be explained only in person. Might add that Ralph and I served the notice on ten members of the cabinet early in the morning, so that by the time they reached their offices the place was full of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As I look back over the scene now I am reminded of Joel 2: 9, which says, ‘They are coming through the doors; they are coming through the windows.’ A number were taken to the police station. Then the officials began to call me up, both police and governmental. Of course we just proceeded ahead, by the Lord's grace, advising the authorities this is Jehovah’s work and vital to the people’s welfare. Finally they gave up and let them all go who had been arrested. The police began to give us some special attention from this point on, but Jehovah’s witnesses went right ahead in the strength of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All day Saturday we put out the radio notices, far into the night, about 200,000 in all. By Jehovah’s grace, on Sunday, His message was heard as clear as a bell. Every word was heard distinctly over the entire field of the veterans camp, which is at least a mile long. Ralph had things in good shape. We had spread the radio folders on Saturday afternoon in the camps also. There were five other camps scattered throughout the District with a small number of veterans. Most of these were encouraged to join the main camp, but the officials had a cordon of police guarding one of these camps of about 3,000, where the men were actually in a state of incarceration, to prevent them from joining the larger groups, but again, by the Lord's grace, we placed battery receiving sets, so they were able to hear the message also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Immediately after the witness was given Jehovah’s witnesses began placing the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font9">booklets in the hands of the veterans. Many questions were asked, and quite some time spent there. They were very orderly; the officers had sent three men with bugles to call them to attention, and every one was commanded to be seated on the ground and be quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Immediately after the broadcast some big popeyed priest was running around with one of his monkey hats on and wanted to talk over the. radio, but he was bluntly told “Nothing doing”. Finally several of the officers of the camp came over and asked what he wanted. When he told them he wanted to speak on the radio they asked if he had heard Judge Rutherford's talk, and further remarked that they did not want him shooting off any more hot air here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We also had amplifiers mounted on a car driving through the streets of Washington after the broadcast. On the sides of the car were scriptures proclaiming Jehovah's name and referring to the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After an hour’s rest the witnesses went into the field carrying bound books and current radio folders to the homes of the people. On the one day, June 26, the following results were realized, by the Lord's grace and goodness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Total number of Jehovah’s witnesses 300</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Total books and booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24,278</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Total hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,140</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Total obtainers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,360</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Total testimonies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,960</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We had every one of the 300 witnesses to register their names and addresses, as per the attached, and took this list to Brigadier General Glassford, superintendent of police, together with the letter outlined by you. I did not request a permit, but simply referred to the message given in the morning and requested him to please see that Jehovah’s witnesses, who were engaged in the most important work on earth, would not be interfered with any more. He immediately assured me that they would not be interfered with any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The response of Jehovah’s witnesses to the call to action, and their boldness and obedience</span></p>

Important issues that threaten the life of a nation cry for decision, yet even the man in the street knows there has been nothing but indecision, straddling, refusal to face the facts. I claim that very much of this state of affairs lies at the doors of the business men and women of this country. I claim that we have worshiped greed and profits at any price, to the point that we have established this standard in the minds of the American people, a standard which is gradually infiltrating the political and social life of the country.</span></p>

The month of February witnessed a rush to sell old gold for twenty-seven to twenty-eight sterling shillings unexampled in the history of Britain. One British duke sold his coronet for £15,000. Wise man; if he had kept it he might have seen it worth something merely as a curiosity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Athens, Ga. “The lecture ‘Can the American Government Endure ?’ came in clearly here from Charlotte, N. C., WBT. It was enjoyed immensely.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Belleville, Ill. “Please send me a copy of the talk by Judge Rutherford this morning. . . . Also heard Judge Rutherford speak of the messengers of Jehovah God and the treatment they receive, in regard to which I will say, if there are any of these people coming here, please let them come to my place and make it their home while working here. I have no mansion, but just a humble home, but they are welcome to what I have.” F. A. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New York, N. Y. “Will you please mail me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s today’s, Sunday's, address, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ I consider it one of the finest addresses delivered in years.” P. P. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lisbon, Ohio. “I would like to have you send me live (5) copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> containing Judge Rutherford’s lecture, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ Several who listened to the lecture have requested me to get these forthem. . . . The message was surely timely and given boldly and fearlessly in the name of Jehovah. Some who never before have had anything to do with anything coming from the ‘Watch-tower’ have expressed themselves much pleased with the straight-forward truthfulness of the entire lecture, both as to present conditions and what we can expect in the near future.” E. E. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Philadelphia, Pa. “I listened in over the radio to your address on the subject, ‘Can the American Government Endure ?’ and enjoyed it much because it is to the point. I shall be much obliged if you will send me a copy so I can study, for myself. The people have wandered away from God and I believe that is the trouble today. Satan is the ruler today of the majority of the people.” W. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mexico, Mo. “Am anxious for a copy of that fine address from Judge Rutherford I heard this morning over the radio. I have his nine books, and this address, like the books, will be passed around to others in darkness, that they may see ‘the light of the world is Jesus’.” A.B.B., King’s Daughters’ Home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peru, Ind. “Will you please favor me by forwarding me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s address, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ Having been an over-seas gunner in the World War, 26 months’ service, disabled in line of duty, but receiving no recognition from the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, I wish that if possible you would call the personal attention of Judge Rutherford to this letter. I consider the judge’s mention in his address of the appeal of the World War Veterans the greatest tribute and recognition that has ever been given the veterans of the World War and their demands for righteousness. In times past the soldiers and sailors have been lauded with false tributes by prominent financial and Government officials who were sure that they never got near the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">front lines.</span><span class="font9"> Such tributes the veterans usually considered with little faith in the men that uttered them, and now we know that they had but little truth in them. Again I wish to commend Judge Rutherford for his faithful mention of the plight of the disregarded veterans of the World War. I shall preserve his address.” G.R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bristol, Tenn. “Please send me copy of Judge Rutherford's radio address of this date.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Swayzee, Ind. “Please send me six copies of Judge Rutherford’s address of June 26. I want to distribute them among my friends. I think that was the most wonderful address I ever heard. I only wish that everyone could have listened to it. I think Judge Rutherford is just right in everything he said.” V. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bangor, Me. “Heard your inspiring broadcast June 26, and am sending for a copy of same. I have just bought a set of your books and find comfort and hope in them. Thanking you in advance and wishing you the Lord's richest blessings in your work.” F. P. H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syracuse, N.Y. “Would you be kind enough to send me the address by Mr. Rutherford of Sunday, June 26.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayton, Ohio. “I listened to Judge Rutherford’s discourse last Sunday. Never have I heard anything more enlightening.

Also, tell us of any way in which we can be of any assistance in this movement.” J. F. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Boston, Mass. “With friends here in my home I heard your address on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ and felt much interested. Would be thankful to you if you will please send me a copy of the same address when you get it off the press, as I wish to read it. We did feel glad to hear you.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whitt, Tex. “I have just listened to Judge Rutherford’s masterpiece over WFAA, Dallas, Texas. Will you please send me a copy.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Elizabeth, N. J. “I listened with much interest to your lecture Sunday morning on the subject, &quot;Can the American Government Endure?’ Your treatment of the subject was praiseworthy and to he highly commended. I am perfectly aware that in an address of such a nature, and with the time at your disposal, only a bare reference to the facts of the case could be made. Most interesting to me were the statements that you made concerning the hold that Big Business has had on the government of this country, especially in its promulgation of its foreign and domestic wars. You intrigued me by the statement that the financiers and business heads were largely responsible for the Civil War. Being a Southerner both by birth and by eminent ancestry, I had always believed this war to be due to the pig-headedness of the North on the question of slavery. Thus you can imagine my surprise at your statement. It is easy to see how modern conditions of government may be controlled by Big Business. . . . I am also very interested in the statement that you made concerning the possibility of a dictator assuming control of this country. Believe me, my dear sir, to be in very deep sympathy with the cause of the Lord. By your lectures and appeals, my whole theological thought has been overturned. For the first time I seem to have a full realization of the full meaning of the Holy Scriptures. I quite agree that this government cannot and will not endure; that the end will come soon.” C. D. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Philadelphia, Pa. “Thank God for the radio and for Judge Rutherford, who is brave and courageous enough to stand firm to his convictions and broadcast truth to these blinded peoples. Will you kindly send me a copy of the message he delivered to us today. My thanks in advance, and assure you of my appreciation.” E. Q. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chicago, Ill. “I have been an interested listener to your wonderful radio programs and at this time request the address by Judge Rutherford, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ My slogan has been that to remedy the wretched conditions we need an earthquake, but, thanks to this wonderful and divinely inspired talk by the judge, I now believe that Christ Jesus can and does solve our problems.” F.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grand Rapids, Mich. “I was greatly impressed and am interested in Judge Rutherford's broadcast Sunday morning on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ Kindly forward me the magazine containing this lecture.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. “I want to take this means to thank you for your wonderful radio lecture last Sunday. I am sure it will enlighten many to the truth of God’s Word. I do hope you will continue to be a regular feature in person each Sunday on the radio, because one of your lectures does more good in bringing the truth to the people than all the Catholic and Protestant sermons put together.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">St. Louis, Mo. “I will appreciate greatly that you will kindly forward a copy of the radio talk of Judge Rutherford, ‘Can the Government Endure?’ I take this opportunity to express my satisfaction that so able a student of world conditions can publicly and without fear expose and point directly to those in high places that are covering iniquities. The newspapers are tremendously delinquent in their responsibilities. They do not, as a general statement, represent the people, nor spiritual principles; they pander to pelf.” B. AV.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">AVabash, Ind. “Got your chain broadcast this morning. The reception was fine, and am profoundly impressed with it. In accordance with your offer, I am asking for a copy of this speech and also the booklet and have ordered the set of books. I have followed Judge Rutherford for about a year in his broadcasts and wish to say that I believe him to be as entirely right as a human can be. May that glorious day hasten that we may not be oppressed any more. I am just one of those ten millions that cannot find a job.” E. F. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayton, Ohio. “Kindly send me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s address, ‘Shall the American Government Endure?’ I wish we had more citizens who had the courage to express in such forceful terms the corruption and lack of faith in this present deplorable state of affairs. Such a man as Judge Rutherford is a credit to anv nation.” M. G.

I have several of his books. I have just been reading his book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font9"> and I sure think his writings all that could be asked for. I am a Methodist, but some of our preachers are afraid to preach the second coming of our Lord, and often afraid to preach the sound truth, for they think it will offend the rich. But I sure like the way Mr. Rutherford hands it out, just like our Lord did when on earth. I pray the Lord will give him power and health to go on in the good work.” R. T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arlington Heights, Mass. “Your courageous assertion that the American Government would certainly go down in the immediate future, along with every other part of Satan’s wicked order, was as it were the glorious voice of Jehovah making known His righteous judgments in tones of thunder, while at the same time giving words of comfort and encouragement to the faithful ones. And what a solemn warning to the order-loving peoples of every land to ‘stand still and see the salvation of God’. May the great God of Battle strengthen, comfort and uphold you in this glorious fight.” W. B. F.</span></p>

It is just what I have thought all along. The evil one seems to have power too great for humanity to endure, yet God will save us from further suffering, and soon. Please send me a copy or two if you can, for the ones that did not get to hear it.” R. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Smithfield, W. Va. “I would like a copy of Judge Rutherford’s address, ‘Can the American Government Endure ?’ Why can't we have more men like him? Mav God bless him and his work.” E. C. T. ’</span></p>

C. “I heard Judge Rutherford’s lecture over my radio, and am writing to ask if you will please send me five copies of his lecture, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ I wish to send some of the copies to different ones and keep one for myself. The idea of living under a dictator surely seems horrible.” W. D. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abilene, Tex. “I heard the wonderful address over station WFAE, Dallas, Tex. Please send me this great American address that every red-blooded American should have and read. I only wish we had some of Judge Rutherford’s kind in Washington, D.C.” J. E. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Connersville, Ind. “I listened to Judge Rutherford’s one-hour broadcast yesterday and am very much interested in your work. You surely have plenty of Bible proof for all your statements.

T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ponca City, Okla. “On Sunday, June 26, I listened to your wonderful talk, beginning at eight o'clock. Please send me a free copy of same. I am now fifty years old and I have listened to all kinds of sermons, but I haven’t as yet heard anything that will equal what you have had to say in bringing the people to the enlightenment of the truth. We have all your books and pamphlets and sure appreciate them.” W. M. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Altoona, Pa. “Please send me a copy of Sunday morning’s radio address. Enclosed is 4c in stamps. I would be glad to pay for the address if I knew what to send. The lecture was marvelous. You are doing a greater service for the people than all the churches combined. Thank you for the truth.” G. W. H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dracut, Mass. “Unless God was back of you it would be impossible to write and talk the truth as you have done. Would like a copy of your speech, if possible.” J. E. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Madison, Ohio. “Heard this morning over WJAY Judge Rutherford’s message, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ I have nerve trouble and can’t concentrate, so would like to read it.” L. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Des Moines, Iowa. “I would appreciate a copy of the speech given over the radio last Sunday by Judge Rutherford, ‘Can the American Government Endure ?’ Or if you can send me three copies, as I want to send one to my folks in Ireland and another to Australia, please do.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Williamsport, Pa. “I just had the pleasure of hearing the Hon. Judge Rutherford in person over the radio. Thanks for such a man, who is gifted so as to be able to tell God’s truth to the people. I have read many of his books and believe that only through men like him can the common people learn the truth. May God be with him, and my hearty congratulations for such a powerful radio address. Please forward by mail to the above address, his radio lecture.” G. H. H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Decatur, Ill. “Words of mine cannot in any way do you justice for that most wonderful and appreciated talk which you gave this morning. I would appreciate it very much if you would send me your talk.” N. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raleigh, K. C. “I have just heard with much interest your lecture, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ over the WPTF station in Raleigh. You mentioned the fact of your belief that we would have a dictator by the first of next year. I happen to be one of the many who have been deprived by Big Business, in losses of honest labor and saving. I know that the Savior of mankind is very near always, and I am satisfied in mv mind that I will be taken care of.” Miss M. H. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cranston, R. I. “Please send me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s speech on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ which I heard over the radio this a. m. I would like my friends to read this for themselves, as I have not been able to convince them that these times are foretold in our Bible. I hope that this will convince them.” C. J. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jackson, Tenn. “A most wonderful message. Words fail me when I try to express my feelings. One incident occurred which more than repaid me for the time and money I spent in advertising the program. My brother, who has been a bitter opponent of the truth, listened to Judge Rutherford's speech. He had his regular Sunday contribution to Babylon in an envelope. After he heard the lecture, he put the money back in his pocket and said, T am through. I know the truth, when I hear it.’ It filled me with joy to hear him say that.” E. B. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sayville, N.Y. “Please forward to my address at your earliest convenience a copy of Judge Rutherford’s wonderful address of this morning, ‘Can the American Government Endure ?’ I pray that Judge Rutherford may be given grace and power from our heavenly Father to continue his work of enlightening and warning, especially for the benefit of God’s children still within the organized bodies known as churches.” W. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dallas, Tex. “I have heard the special national broadcast transmitting through WFAA of Dallas the magnificent and courageous address by Judge J. F. Rutherford, last Sunday morning, June 26. If I recall correctly, the address was entitled ‘Will the U. S. Government Survive?’ Please mail me a copy of the abovementioned address. I would also be pleased to have you send me a copy of each of the addresses made by Judge Rutherford by radio since, the first of the year. I have heard some of these, but not all, and would therefore like to have them for my file. Would it be asking you too much to have you place my name on your mailinglist for a copy of each of the radio talks made by Judge Rutherford in the future? If you can do that, I shall be grateful to you for it. I always enjoy these talks; they are courageous and full of truths, and, according to my way of thinking, Judge Rutherford is doing more public good with his radio talks than any other feature of broadcast that may be given out by the National Broadcasting Company.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paterson, N. J. “Will you kindly send me a copy of Judge Rutherford’s address over the radio, June 26, ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ The address was most wonderful to my mind, and I trust millions heard it and will understand that God is love, and what is going on now is purely and simply the Devil’s work. Thanking you in advance, I am yours in the cause of justice.” C. L. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chelsea, Mass. “I would much appreciate a copy of Judge Rutherford's radio talk of Sunday, June 26. It is the finest discourse I ever listened to.” F. E. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pittsburgh, Pa. &quot;Will you please send me a copy of the sermon called ‘Can the American Government Endure’’ I will appreciate your kindness a lot.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Moline, Ill. “My! How we enjoyed Judge Rutherford's address this morning, and what truths he told! Hope we may hear more of the same. Please send me a copy of his talk.” H.A.Z.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kaymoor, W.Va. “I heard Judge Rutherford's address over the radio last Sunday, and wish to say that it -was a masterly exposition of the present world dilemma, and its only solution. I have been a close observer of all that has been said and written by the late Pastor Russell and Judge Rutherford for a good many years, and believe them to be the greatest Bible students of modern times. Please send me a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> containing the address, and I would like to have a half dozen other copies for distribution among my friends, if you can spare them. Wishing the Watch Tower and Judge Rutherford all the power possible in pushing their message to the farthest parts of the earth.” C. B. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Columbus, Ohio. “I have just heard every word of Judge Rutherford’s ‘Can the American Government Endure?' and certainly do want the lecture in print. If a clerk happens to read this letter I hope you can show it to Judge Rutherford with our sincere thanks as war veterans for his remarks about the Bonus marchers. I am a veteran; worked nine years here in Columbus on mass production at the Timken Roller Bearing Company at night, twelve hours per night; paid $1,700 on a semi-modern home and have just lost it, so you can well imagine how 1 relished his great talk this morning. My wife cried several times during the lecture, so plainly could she see the truth of every word. I firmly believe that Judge Rutherford is a selected master mind to point out these truths, as Noah was before the Flood. The people who distribute your books are and have always been welcome in our house, and all that have come to our place have shown that they feel that their tasks are necessary. This lecture is the best I have ever heard anywhere any time.” D. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fort Wayne, Ind. ‘‘Would very much like to have the copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> with address of Judge Rutherford on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ We are staunch believers in Jehovah's witnesses and have nine of Judge Rutherford's books.” W. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Philadelphia, Pa. ‘‘Enjoyed your inspiring talk this morning over the radio. In hearty accord with your ideas.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nacogdoches, Tex. ‘‘I have just listened to Judge Rutherford in his address, ‘Can America Endure ?’ I heartily appreciate and commend h</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9"> and what he says. Please send me a copy of this address. 1 would like to have several copies for distribution and I will be glad to pay for them. Please let me know what they will cost. I will want at least a dozen copies. I heartily endorse Judge Rutherford in all that he said in his address. I am very anxious to see what the reaction to his lecture will be. Please tell me just what The Watch Tower is, and what it stands for and does. I am very much interested, and this is the first time I have heard your program.” R. M. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kokomo, Ind. “This morning I heard the radio address of Judge Rutherford. I wish to thank him for the message and would greatly appreciate having a copy of it. Also, I should like to know when I may hear from him over the radio in the future. I am very much interested in the subject, as I feel we are surely in the last days. Thanking you for a copy of the radio address.” P. A. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barberton, Ohio. “Being impressed by Judge Rutherford’s talk today on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ causes me to write for the complete talk, as it is very interesting. If the judge’s talk had been at 9 p. m. instead of a. m. 20 millions more would have heard it, and, again, maybe not.” E. F. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Clovis, N.Mex. “The writer heard the address of Judge J. F. Rutherford through WFAA of Dallas on the subject Will the American Government Stand?’ I desire a printed copy of that address, and will further advise that I am the teacher of a men’s Bible class in one of our Sunday schools and have about fifty men in the class. I would very much like to have several copies to place in the hands of these men if you can consistently supply us with same.” J. L. L. (Bank official)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brockton, Mass. “Please send me your address of June 25. I wish we had more public-spirited citizens like you. God love you!” W.C.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Glendale, N. Y. “Your talks over station WMCA every Sunday morning are a comfort to the people in these trying days. Since I was able to read I read a chapter of the Bible each night until I was 21 years old, and since I have been listening to your Sunday talks I have gone back to read the Bible, and I feel the comfort and rest that you want the people to have, and that is faith in Jehovah God. Your talk on ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ is a masterpiece. I know that your talks are not in vain. The people of this country and of the world need men of your courage and type in these trying days to show them the way as it is in the Bible. May God grant you good health, long life and happiness.” J. P. T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">West Allis, Wis. “I was deeply impressed by Judge Rutherford's broadcast over KYW, Chicago, Will Our Government Endure?’ and would be very much pleased to receive a copy and pass on to many who did not hear it. Praise God for men who have the courage to speak forth these great truths as the holy spirit guides, instead of quenching it.” G. P. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chicago, Ill. “To say we thoroughly enjoyed your address of Sunday, June 26, is saying entirely too little. May we have a copy of this address? And if not asking too much, kindly put my name on your mailing list for future speeches. What this country needs is a man like you to fill the president’s chair. Thank you many times for the enjoyable hour. This is the first time we have heard your broadcast, but will be looking and listening from now on for each one. Greater power to you for these great thoughts, and wisdom so ably expressed.” J. T. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Maumee, Ohio. “I listened with much interest to your Sunday address on the possibility of the American nation’s existing. I think there is no doubt that the United States was a chosen nation, but has since lost its precedence with the Lord. What I want to ask about is: you say the common people must be patient and endure until the crucial moment when they are freed from capitalistic rule, but you did not say about how long this might be and how we can continue to exist without income. I have friends who call you radical, in spite of my persistence in telling them what you and your books say. Would appreciate a copy of the talk of Sunday, June 26.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">D. W. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fort Worth, Tex. “Kindly send me as many copies of Judge Rutherford's wonderful address, ‘The American Government: Can It Endure?’ as the enclosed $1.00 will buy. The speech which Judge Rutherford made was the most wonderful which I have had the pleasure of hearing him deliver. May the Lord bless him abundantly, that he may be enabled to give the public many more of such discourses in the future. May the Lord's blessing also be given to those worthy men and women who are assisting in the furtherance of His work in various parts of the world.” C.L.W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Newport, Del. “Let me express to you my congratulations for the wonderful message of comfort and good cheer which came from your station this morning on the Watchtower chain program.

H. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Detroit, Mich. “Have heard Judge Rutherford's analysis of conditions leading up to the present ‘distress of nations with perplexity’, in yesterday’s morning lecture from WJAY, Cleveland. I must confess that Big Business is supervised by the ruler of the darkness of this world. Discrimination is made against men past 40 years of age. According to their policy a man past 40 years of age is fit for nothing but the bone yard, or to be kept by the tax payers, as Big Business is hiring the youth of the land. If they don’t work cheaply enough, they are replaced by women or girls at $7 to $13 per week. Such an injustice and height of unrighteousness towards the helpless widows and orphans, all that the overseers and rulers may have their big income and stockholders may maintain their dividends. Always am an admirer of your lectures and articles in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font9"> Ever keep up the good work, in Jesus’ name.” IL C. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fort Worth, Tex. “1 have just heard over WFAA, Dallas, Texas, the wonderful address given by Judge Rutherford. I will certainly appreciate receiving a copy of ‘Can the American Government Endure?’ I have not words to express my feeling of gratitude for the privilege of hearing Judge Rutherford this morning and his masterful address; also for whatever part The Watch Tower had in making such possible. </span><span class="font9">I too happen to be one of the many who has lost his job, with nothing possible in sight to do; one who has in the past had a convenient, comfortable living, but now almost everything gone, and with a wife and a soon-expected addition to the family to support on nothing. My only salvation is trusting in God. I thank God for men like Judge Rutherford, and am praying that we might have more like him. May God’s richest blessings be upon him and also upon The Watch Tower, with all of its associates in this great work you are doing. May God save us and our nation, along with the rest of the world.” J.S.G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scranton, Pa. “I listen in on all of your talks, and I greatly enjoy them. You said last Sunday that if I would like a copy of your sermon, to write and ask for it. When can I get your sermons, how often, and on what stations, and on what days ? I enjoy listening in so much that I hate to lose any of your talks. Please send me your sermons and anything that will help me in understanding the gospel more thoroughly. Please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience. I got your sermon over station WGBI, Scranton, at nine o'clock Sunday morning.” C. K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hope, Ark. “We listened to your excellent address through station WFAA, Dallas, Texas, and wish to congratulate you upon your farsightedness, which is a splendid antidote for the prevalent nearsightedness of the rank and file of the population. We are straight-laced Presbyterians, and I teach an adult class in our Sunday school, but do not find it at all difficult to coordinate our beliefs with yours. Please send me a copy of your address.” M. E. T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crisfield, Md. ‘Will you kindly send me a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine and a copy of the lecture which was delivered by Judge Rutherford yesterday, June 26, on ‘Can Our Government Endure?’ I want to compliment Judge Rutherford for the fearless type of lectures that he delivers over the radio. All of us look for Sunday to come, in order that we may listen to his lectures.” Dr. J. H. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rockford, Ill. “Will you please send me a list of the stations you broadcast from, and the hours. It is plainly written in the sky that your words of this morning are coming to pass. Would like to know more about the Battle of Armageddon. Please direct me to an enlightenment ; your talk and direction to the Scriptures was so clear, this morning.” E. II. P.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font9"> copy of the message broadcast Sunday morning was placed in the hands of the veterans today, to be published in their newspaper, which comes out on Saturday; this according to their request. I should add that after the broadcast the men in camp gave several rousing cheers and openly expressed their gratefulness to you and all of Jehovah’s witnesses who had some part in giving this message to them and to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The conditions described by you are so well pictured at the seat of this government here in Washington that every one with a reasonable mind could see the truth of the statements made. Many throughout the camp, as well as in Washington, openly assented that they believed that the time has come when this wicked organization must go down, but they never fully understood just what was going on until yesterday. Jehovah greatly blessed you, and we are grateful to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is good to His people. We rejoice to serve Him and trust we shall be daily His delight. The 300 here join me in sending loving greetings to you, with gratefulness for the privilege of being in the army of the King to serve our God Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Requesting Judge Rutherford’s Lecture</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Can the American Government Endure?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After hearing this startling lecture and then reading it in this magazine, all will be convinced, we feel sure, that Judge Rutherford knows what he is talking about. His statements are based on facts and supported by Bible prophecy. Anyone who reads his books will find that ample proof is offered to back up every conclusion he so well presents. It is because of this convincing manner in which he treats his Bible explanations that his books have reached the record circulation of 120,000,000 copies within the past twelve years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you have not yet read these marvelous books explaining Jehovah’s purposes clearly, logically and convincingly, you must do it now or soon. They are free from creedal or religious fantasy and when you read them you can understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">His books are offered to anyone at the bare cost of manufacturing and distribution. That is why all ten of his bound books may be had for only $2.50. Each is attractively bound in cloth, embossed and gold-stamped, contains 350 or more pages, and is beautifully illustrated. If at the present time you do not wish the entire set of ten, choose any four of them for $1.00; or, taken singly, 30c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For your convenience we print below a coupon, to which you can attach your money order for the literature. All books are mailed to you prepaid.</span></p>

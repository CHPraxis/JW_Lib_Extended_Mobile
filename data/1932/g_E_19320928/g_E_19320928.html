<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Semi-Invisible Friends and Foes—the Insects</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Two Parts—Part 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE best friends man has, and the worst enemies he has, are invisible. Our praise and adoration rise “unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God”. (1 Tim. 1:17) Our hope and faith are pinned to Him “who is the image of the invisible God”. (Col. 1:15) Like Moses of old, we endure “as seeing him who is invisible”.—Heb. 11: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Next to our heavenly Father and our Savior, our best friends are in their entourage invisible, the holy angels that go forth to do Jehovah’s will, the members of the heavenly organization that we know are soon to smite all evil in the earth and really and truly robe it in God’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ranged on the opposite side, and equally invisible, are Satan and his cohorts. In “the evil day”, since Satan was cast out of heaven, there is utmost need of “the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”.—Eph. 6:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our visible friends are mostly good men and women, the plant world and the domestic animals. Our visible enemies are mostly bad men and women. The foes of the plant world are, generally speaking, semi-invisible. The wild animals that onee were serious foes to man have been mostly killed off. The semi-invisible friends and foes of man exist by the duodecillions. This article is about them; we briefly discuss a few of the better known insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">185J000 Kinds of Flies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We hope nobody will conclude that we are about to attempt to describe the 185,000 kinds of flies estimated to be in existence. In the first place, only about 35,000 of these flies have been described by anybody, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> complete description of even the common house fly would be a considerable article in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About the house fly, you may have had one determined to land somewhere on your body. If you have, why should we write about it? All we will say is that a female fly will at one time lay 120 eggs in a pile of manure, and thereby puts to lasting shame the hen that has so much to say when she gingerly lays but one. In six or eight hours the fly’s eggs turn into maggots, and in ten days the maggots turn into adult flies, and the procession begins all over again. It is estimated that one pound of manure will sustain the eggs of 1,200 house flies, and bring to maturity 144,000 flies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The house fly is not particular what kind of excrement it lives in. It does not mind in the least making its home in privies, or in the sick room. It likes to go from one to the other, and from there to the kitchen and dining room, and then to your bald head, and if anywhere en route it can wipe itself off and spread typhoid germs or anything else around it is most happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its number of eyes the fly has us all beat. We forget the exact figures but believe the estimates are that each fly has some 5,000 pairs of eyes, or lenses through which to receive information. At one time he can look all around him in a circle horizontally, and at anything and everything that is anywhere overhead, and pretty much everything around his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it comes to strength we are nothing. The big Turk in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West supported ten men on his shoulders, but a bluebottle fly can lift thirty times its own weight and can draw a load 150 times as heavy. It is not so strong on its wings; if kept continuously on the move for 18 minutes its strength is exhausted and it refuses to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The odor of daisies is objectionable to flies. It is said that a few bouquets of these placed around the room will keep them away entirely. The cost of keeping flies out of American homes has been estimated at about $10,000,000 annual-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ly. The stable fly, big brother to the house fly, is worse than his little brother, because he bites harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Hessian Fly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Hessian fly gets after us another way. It eats our food, our wheat. It is short-lived, its usual life span lasting less than a week. But during that week it makes up for lost time. The female of the spring generation'lays 230 eggs; and of the fall generation, 285. The eggs are laid on the upper surface of the wheat leaves, being reddish in color, very minute, and just visible to the unaided eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a few days the eggs hatch and maggots emerge which crawl down the leaf to joints near the base of the plant, where they suck the sap from the stem and damage or ruin the plant. The feeding stage lasts about three weeks, when, without changing its location, the maggot forms a brown case about itself called a puparium. It then has the appearance of a flaxseed. From this puparium the adult fly eventually emerges, and leaps to another plant to start life all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The farmer can get but one crop of wheat a year, but he gets two crops of Hessian flies: one in the spring, to feed on his spring wheat, and one in the fall, to feed on his winter wheat. In the fall the fly has sense enough to stay low down on the plant, where it will be relatively warmer, but in the spring it gets into the upper branches, where it can get better food and enjoy being waved about in the breezes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Mediterranean Fruit Fly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Mediterranean fruit fly is another very bad actor in the fly family. When only four to ten days old the female fly knows enough to drill a tiny hole through the skin of almost any kind of fruit and lay from four to twenty eggs in the ripening pulp. She does this every day for three months, by which time she may have ruined a hundred oranges and reared five hundred children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It takes about three weeks for one generation to mature. The eggs quickly hatch into larva;, each equipped with two spine-like hooks with which to tear the tissue as they go boring their way through the fruit. By listening with the electrical stethoscope one can hear these little fellows at their devastating work. This helped science to conquer them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As they grow in size and strength the larva; work their way out of the fruit and drop to the ground, where they have the peculiar ability of being able to curl up and jump from one to six inches. They next go into the pupa state, and after a few days burrowed into the ground emerge as mature flies ready to begin another round of cussedness all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In April, 1929, the Mediterranean fruit fly, which has ravaged the Hawaiian Islands, made <sup>-</sup>its appearance in Florida. In a whirlwind campaign it cost the government $6,355,000 to exterminate the pest completely and to reimburse the growers for the damage done to the trees and the fruit destroyed. It is believed to be the first victory science has won over an insect. At one time the government had 5,000 men on the job, fighting the pest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Californians have a less serious pest in the citrus white fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Buffalo Fly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The buffalo fly is spreading over Australia. This insect was brought from Java, but seems to thrive more in its new home than in its old one. There are some who fear that this fly may put an end to the raising of fat cattle for slaughter, in at least some parts of the island continent. It has already become a main limiting factor in beef production in the northern area of the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One thing is sure. If trade and travel are not doing anything else in the world, they are spreading earth’s pests around so that no spot is overlooked in which a fly shall have a chance to see what it can do. Hundreds of new varieties are popping up every year. What harm they may do to humanity we cannot know until they have been distributed around a bit and started to add and multiply and do arithmetical and geometrical progression in squares raised to the nth power.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1,500 Kinds of Mosquitoes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Of the 1,500 kinds of mosquitoes known to scientists only 131 varieties have been found in the United States, but that is enough, and sometimes too many. The gentlemen are all well-behaved; they feed exclusively on plant juices. It is the women that found out how to torture us. It was a bad day for humanity when the first female mosquito “struck oil” by drilling through some human hide and finding juices underneath that seemed almost as good to her as the fruit or plant juices with which she was more familiar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We say ‘almost as good’ instead of ‘quite as good’, for the reason that there is room to suspect that human blood is not as agreeable to mosquitoes as some of their other forms of food. There are varieties that will not touch a human when horses are near. They prefer the taste of the horse’s blood. Another variety is fond of frogs, but will not touch humans at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The female mosquito is a disagreeable person. In a deceptive manner she lands so lightly that one does not know she is present. Then she soft-soaps her intended victim into thinking that nothing serious is contemplated, by spreading a little fluid over the skin, the purpose of which is to soften it and get it ready for the saw. What a mean disposition!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The saw is a wicked contrivance, with 22 teeth, made to go through the human cuticle in shortest time. When a sufficiently large hole has been made, a small hose pipe is run down into the reservoir and the unprincipled creature begins the transfer of your lifeblood to her own anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It would not be so bad if she would do that once and stop there, but that is only the beginning. If her posterity all lived, it is calculated that one solitary mosquito mother would in one year increase the mosquito population of the earth by 159,000,000,000; yet a hen has to be encouraged in every kind of way to lay one egg a day. Shame on the hen!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Truly Dangerous Creature</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A truly dangerous creature is the female mosquito that has learned to drill holes in man and suck his blood. It is calculated that mosquitoes have slain more humans than were ever slain by all other animals put together. As distributors of yellow fever and malaria, they have caused themselves to be feared as w<sup>y</sup>ell as hated. It has been found that twenty percent of the planes arriving at Miami from South American countries contain some species of disease-bearing tropical mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some varieties of mosquitoes that are cannibals; at least they live entirely by eating other mosquito larva?. Some are dwellers only in forests. Others are entirely house-dwellers. Those in the Arctic seem to be the most voracious of anywhere on earth. There is one kind in Montana which stores up fat in the summer and hibernates in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greatest single disaster laid to mosquitoes is the Black Tom explosion of munitions at the piers in Jersey City in July, 1916. It is believed that this explosion was caused by a smudge fire built by watchmen to keep off the mosquitoes. The cost of the material destroyed is estimated at about $50,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among scientists, Mosquito Day is celebrated on August 20, the anniversary of the date in 1897 when Sir Ronald Ross discovered in the stomach of the anopheles mosquito the black granules he had many times previously seen in the malaria cells in human blood. It was definitely proved on that day that the anopheles mosquito is the carrier of malarial germs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Mosquitoes a Peculiar Problem</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The mosquito problem is one peculiarly difficult to handle, on account of the great number of varieties. Sonie kinds are travelers, and some are not. In many instances those that annoy man were bred on his own lot. An empty tomato can makes an ideal breeding place and home for a colony of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mosquitoes prefer blondes. It is said that a brunette will be spared nine times out of ten when a blonde is present, and that among the animals the light-colored ones are the greatest sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The United States Public Health Service asserts that where the effluent of a town septic-tank empties into a small stream near the edge of a town, the water thence will sometimes be black with mosquito larvae for a distance of two or three miles. The Culex variety seems to prefer dirty water to clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is claimed that a person can discipline himself so as to feel a mosquito bite but slightly. Some have even said that if no resistance is made there is a certain sort of pleasurable sensation, akin to that of adding hot water to a hot foot bath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The irritation of the flesh is caused by the softening fluid first put upon it to soften it. If this is scratched in, the wound is made more difficult to bear. It is said that if a needle is inserted in the skin exactly where the mosquito inserted its drain pipe, and two drops of blood are removed, all the poison is thereby taken and the itching ceases. Rubbing a little onion juice on a mosquito bite is said to relieve the itch and to keep mosquitoes away. Mosquitoes also dislike the odor of lemon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The “Gambusiafinis”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The gambusia apinis, a little fish three quarters of an inch long, that makes its habitat off the coast of Florida, is one of the most efficient destroyers of mosquitoes. In a half an hour a dozen of these will eat a pint of mosquito larvae. In twenty-four hours this little fish devours sixty times its own weight in mosquito larva?, its favorite food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Referring to the prodigious appetite of the gambusia apinis one of the New York newspapers several times miscalled it “gambusiafinis”. It was not a half bad error. The gambusia spells the finis of the mosquito in jig time when inserted in the place where he breeds. Goldfish and pollywogs eat mosquito larva? with great gusto, also. Dragon flies are fond of them, too. They take them on the wing, as do many varieties of birds, bats, spiders, lizards and frogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been discovered that if a barn stands between a swamp and a house the residents of the house will be comparatively free from annoyance. The mosquitoes get as far as the barn, and as they prefer horse meat to human, the human escapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Frenchman has met with some success in substituting in a certain locality what we might call good mosquitoes for bad ones. As a result, a district which was notoriously bad is now populated by a certain variety that avoids man, probably because of the saline condition of his blood.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A §60,000 Mosquito</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At the national capital in May, 1930, $60,000 was appropriated to fight mosquitoes on the White House lawn. A gentleman who had lived for twenty years in the immediate vicinity testified he had never seen one or heard one. The appropriation contained an item of $9,000 for automobiles. The House turned the legislation down, but a letter from the president insisted that it be passed, and it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">America cannot afford to have a mosquito buzzing around on the White House lawn, not as long as we can afford $9,000 for automobiles to chase it. At the time this $60,000 mosquito was being hunted for on the White House lawn, the president was at Rapidan. We cannot afford to have a great man like Herbert Hoover bitten by a $60,000 mosquito, and so while the hunt was on he was away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Governments do not feel as wealthy now as they did in 1928, but in that year the federal and state governments expended upward of $100,000,000 in the war against mosquitoes. Poison gases were used, deadly acids and powders, oil, fish and birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Airplane dusting was found a good method. A plane flies low over a mosquito swamp, spreading a Paris green mixture or oil. By this method from 80 percent to 90 percent of the larvae are destroyed, and it is cheaper and quicker than the old-fashioned hand-spraying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are some plants that feed on mosquito larvae. One of these, the bladderwort, has small bladders in which to entrap the larvae. One of the water ferns is also deadly to them. It is thought that the growing plant releases chemicals inimical to four of the varieties. In any event, it is known that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chara fragilis,</span><span class="font3"> as it is called, gives off oxygen bubbles which are fatal to larvae when they are in the wiggler stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very interesting and important discovery has been made that clover, peas and beans furnish a juice called coumarin which does not destroy the mosquito but which does kill the amoeba of malaria which may be in the mosquito, with the result that there is no malaria in a region which grows these useful and valuable crops. Citronella grass, which grows only in the tropics, is a mosquito repellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That it is necessary that the mosquito be controlled is suggested by the fact that malaria, which is a mosquito-borne disease, is believed to have brought the downfall of Greece and Rome. It is claimed that Alexander the Great died of malaria.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Shocking Way of Dealing with Mosquitoes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">An accidental but altogether shocking way of disposing of mosquitoes was discovered at the General Electric Company's laboratory at Lynn, Mass. It seems that the male mosquito has bushy antenna projecting from the side of his head. These enable him to locate the presence of the singing female anywhere for several miles around. Well, the heartless engineers put up a job on the male mosquitoes. They devised a hummer that sounds exactly like a singing female. The males came in droves and got cooked to death by the million. This probably served them right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Outright electrocution of all kinds of insects has also been resorted to. A weak current is run through a transformer into wire gauze. Any insect alighting upon the gauze is electrocuted. During the day, bait is used to attract the in-s^ts and at night a light is placed inside the gauze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Gorgas plan of mosquito destruction, which changed Panama from a center of malaria and yellow fever to a health resort, is based on the destruction of mosquito larvae by a special type of drainage and other permanent work. Yellow fever had been rampant in Havana for 150 years and was conquered by the Gorgas plan in eight months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Gorgas plan has been put into effect in the marshlands to be found within the area of Greater New York. In one section alone 1,500,000 feet of ditches were dug. In inland districts where draining was not feasible the mosquitobreeding swamps were covered with fuel oil, which kills the larva?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sportsmen have objected that the drainage of swamps not only kills off the mosquitoes but also kills off the birds that feed upon them, and when the swamps are oiled it kills the larvae but it also kills the fish. But it is evidently important to reduce the number of mosquitoes, even if it does result in fewer birds and fish. The wishes of the game killers may well be ignored; the business of taking wild life is a bad business.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Shingles of the Butterfly</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Laid on with meticulous care, overlapping each other in the same mannei- as shingles on a roof, the little shingles that cover the frame of the butterfly are among the most beautiful things of which we have any knowledge. Not all of these shingles are filled with coloring matter, but many of them are. Some of the colors are obtained by interference, the breaking-up of the rays of light when they hit the tiny ridges found on some of the shingles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These shingles help to give firmness to the butterfly’s wings. They average about 1/100 of an inch long by a width one-fourth as great. Each is a little flattened sac, which may have either granules of coloring matter or simply air. In the case of the males these sacs give off an odor supposed to be attractive to the females. A male may completely envelope a female in these odors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The shingles can be removed from a butterfly’s house, but he is still a butterfly, though all his beauty is gone. It is the exquisite way in which the shingles are laid on, and the tricks that are played on the eye, that make him so beautiful. Examined under the microscope it is found that a beautiful bronzed blue is not blue at all. It looks blue because a quite plain brown has a transparent shingle top resting upon it, and the light is interfered with in such a way as to make the color appear different from what it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Certain butterflies which have unusually large and strong scales are known to make faint squeaking noises by the rubbing together of the fore and hind wings. The noise is caused by the shingles’ shifting their position as the house beneath them is moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the first creatures to venture out of doors in the spring is the so-called “mourning cloak’’. It does its eating as a caterpillar. As a butterfly it may sip the honey from a flower, but that is all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Africa Its True Home</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Africa, the true home of the butterfly, a writer describes a migration of small white butterflies, something like the cabbage white, which he estimates to have been 600 miles long. They all flew within fifty feet of the ground. When they came to a house they flew up and over it and down again, and with trees proceeded in the same way. The heaviest rainstorms did not stop them or turn them aside. Those that lived kept on; those that died were not missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In their migrations in Africa it sometimes happens that one kind of butterfly will be going in one direction and one in another. If the paths meet or cross at any angle there is no confusion; both kinds keep to their course. Some of the migrations northward take groups as far as Iceland. Probably none of these survive the Icelandic winters, but there will be more from Africa to take their place the next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some kinds of butterflies, as, for instance, the black-marked milkweed butterfly, migrate southward in the fall, while the southern cabbage butterfly reverses the procedure and migrates southward in the spring. The birds take millions of them, but there are millions to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Travelers in Ceylon report having passed through a swarm of butterflies so thick that the wheels of the auto skidded and the car with difficulty made headway through them for seven minutes. Migrations of the large cabbage white butterfly over Germany are sometimes so thick as to resemble a snowstorm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Butterflies have various odors, according to the variety. Most of the odors are like the flowers upon which they feed; others have a repellent odor and even the birds will not eat them. It has been noticed that some butterflies are like some humans. After they have once mated they are never of any use afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A woman in Iowa has a butterfly farm. Though starting it as a hobby, she has made it a paying proposition by raising some four hundred varieties in a screened porch and selling them. Specimens are mounted for tray and table decorations, and for the use of schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The big blue butterfly of Brazil has been so much sought as an article of commerce that the state has had to enact legislation to protect it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Gsiting Rid of Moths</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">If we could just get rid of the moths that corrupt we would save about $200,000,000 a year. Moths do not attack garments that are worn as often as once a week, or that are brushed, cleaned or<sup>-</sup> beaten twice a month. No practical treatment known will render wearing apparel absolutely immune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Naphthalene, in the form of flakes or mothballs, is very effective, as is also paradichlorobenzol. Camphor is good for tight chests, and so is pyrethrum powder. Dry heat at 100 degrees for eight hours will finish the living inhabitants of stuffed furniture. One night of zero temperature will do the same thing. Moths are also discouraged by alternations of heat and cold. They do not like the smell of cedar oil, and will not stay in closets lined with Tennessee red cedar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are several large green caterpillars which weave for themselves silken cocoons in which to pass the winter, and in the spring they emerge as emperor moths. The death's head moth of Europe and Asia robs beehives and continues feeding on the honey until stung to death. When excited he utters a piteous mouse-like squeak. Persons with sharp ears can hear the caterpillars of the privet hawk moth crunch lilac leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A fly which was imported from Europe to act as a parasite on the gypsy and brown tail moths so plentiful in New England has proven well adapted to its work. Certain collections of the larvie of the satin moth were found parasitized as much as 78 percent by this agent. Some fifty other agents were employed for the purpose, about fifteen of which have accomplished something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In July, 1932, New York city had an invasion of moths that were once measuring worms. To check a similiar invasion in 1862 the English sparrow was imported and has killed off most of our American song-birds. It has proven one of the worst pests ever brought into the country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>One or Two Bee Items</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">On other occasions we have published articles on bees, sometimes several pages long. Here we mention one or two odd items. A French scientist claims that bees are guided solely by odor and will often pass a scentless flower stored with honey for one having a sweet perfume and little sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bees had a good time near Karlovac, Serbia. In moving a freight car it became derailed and a jar of honey was cracked. A few bees sniffed it and sent home for volunteers. The swarm came about the time the wrecking car arrived and they stayed with the honey until it was all cleaned up. The wreckers had to give it up until sundown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Did you know that bees would eat grapes? A grape grower claims that they do, and that when the days are very warm he has known a swarm to settle down on a vine and leave nothing but the empty skins of what had been luscious fruit. Yellow jackets are more destructive of grapes than are the bees, but both know how to puncture the skin and make off with the nectar. Bees yield honey of the value of $6,000,000 annually. They are essential to the production of satisfactory crops of most orchard fruits.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Some Marvels of the Spider</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The spider, speaking technically, is not an insect. Most insects have wings; the spider has none, yet it is so good an aeronaut as to fly for fifty miles or more out over the sea in an airplane of its own construction. Most insects have feelers or antenna?; the spiders have none, yet spiders speak to one another by vibrations. An insect has three pairs of legs; a spider has four. Insects have three pairs of jaws; spiders have two pairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of the spider’s legs are curved toothed claws. By means of these claws a spider will hold on to a ceiling. If his hold slips, he instantly pays out the drag rope which is always trailing behind him, and, instead of ignominiously falling, descends with dignity on a cable made for the purpose. Sometimes he comes part way down, reascends, and takes up his journey where he left off, meantime taking up the cable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every variety of spider has its own peculiar kind of web, and the little spiders when they come into the world have the knowledge of how to make that particular form of web. The general plan of all webs is the same. First placed are the foundation lines, which may be three or four in number. The second step is to drop a perpendicular from the middle of the top foundation line to the middle of the bottom one. The third step is to put in the rays, all of which start at the center and are hauled taut. The fourth step is to start at the center and lay down the temporary spiral, and the last step is to start at the circumference and make the viscid permanent spiral. As this last spiral is laid the temporary spiral is taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The method by which a spider connects two trees a dozen feet apart is to let down a perpendicular from one tree, descend it, cross the intervening area, taking advantage of a favorable wind if possible, ascend the other tree and haul the line taut. After that the web can be placed anywhere desired.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The Heartless Females</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The young male spider contemplating matrimony has to stop, look and listen. Not only is the lady of his choice fickle, but she is many times his size, and frequently the dead and juiceless skeletons of his brothers decorate her apartments. Indeed, some of the heartless creatures make a business of eating their husbands when they have no further use for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hunting spider has been seen to dance in more than one hundred circles in front of his lady love, humping himself up first on one side and then on the other, in the effort to win her admiration. One kind of hunting spider brings with him a present of a choice fly neatly wrapped in silk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The web-spinning spider comes up to the web of his lady love and strokes a thread of the net, setting up peculiar vibrations which the lady spider recognizes. The males often fight together to determine who shall have the right to enter a certain web the entrance of which may mean death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The female spiders, though savage sweethearts, are good mothers. Some of them carry their eggs about with them wherever they go, all carefully wrapped in silk so as to protect them from injury. When the eggs mature, fully developed spiders issue forth from them. All spiders are poisonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The silk for a spider’s net is exuded from its body as a liquid jet which hardens instantaneously upon exposure to the air. Though it is but one two-thousandth as large as a horsehair it is so strong that a spider has been known to entrap a mouse, a snake nine inches long, frogs and toads. In the case of the mouse, by an intricate engineering feat the tiny creature lifted the heavy body of its victim into its net.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In New Guinea the Papuans use spider webs for fishnets. The Papuans build the frames, stick them up in the forest where the giant spiders will see them, and shortly have good nets well able to hold for the purpose.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The W onderful Water Spider</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">'There is a variety of spider that, though it is an air-breathing insect, lives under the water for hours at a time, builds its nest there, and rears its young by means of air which it stores in a reservoir made of silk. It may swim on the surface of the water on its back until it has collected a quantity of air, when it suddenly dives, carrying the air with it for use below the surface, as occasion may require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One mother spider makes a trapdoor nest, sunk deep in the earth. The shaft is smooth, plastered,and fitted with a lid with a silken hinge. It provides a safe home for her babies while they are growing up and getting ready to shift for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “spider” is a corruption of the word “spinner” or “spinster”, the spinning one. “Cob” is an old name for spider, hence the origin of the name “cobweb”. The spider’s teeth are merely for holding his victim. He takes only liquid food. He has from six to eight eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brazil has spiders a foot across, the most repulsive creatures imaginable. These spiders catch humming birds and other creatures of equal size. The black widow, more or less common from New Hampshire to Patagonia, will sometimes, under great provocation, attack humans. A single bite has been known to kill a horse. It is spreading very rapidly in the Hawaiian Islands at the present time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In Mexico there are spiders which live in societies, construct common nests of large dimensions, and have their food supplies in common. The nests are kept with utmost cleanliness by little creatures, Latricides, which nourish themselves on everything cast off by the spiders.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Other Little Friends of Man</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While there are some scientists that profess to believe that the ultimate owners of the earth and everything in it will be giant spiders, yet the general and manifestly the correct view is that spiders are a blessing to man because they help to keep down the insects that prey upon man’s food. The general view is that it is the insects, and not the spiders, with which man is waging a fight to the death, and that man must find some way to control the insects or he is done for as a resident of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the insects there are numerous parasites which, like the spiders, subsist entirely upon animal life, i. e., upon other insects or their larvae. The little wasp, bracon mellitor, is one of these. It lays its eggs in the hole in which the boll weevil has deposited its egg. The parasite larva, on hatching, bores into the boll weevil larva and eats it up; so good-bye, boll weevil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pecan growers have found a little friend in the trichogramma minutum. This friendly little sinner, which is almost invisible to human eyes, lays its eggs in multiple sets of twins inside the eggs of the foe of the pecan grower known as the nut case borer, and the hopes of the borer of raising a nice large family all perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a somewhat similar little wasp which it is believed will be useful in keeping down the coddling moth, a pest that produces worms in apples. This parasite is being studied at the Moorestown (N.J.) laboratory. The trichogramma minutum is being bred in quantities at Brownwood, Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In California, for many years, the ladybug has been bred for use in the citrus groves. It has an appetite for mealy bugs, and mealy bugs have an appetite for oranges and other citrus fruits. If the ladybug lands on the mealy bug before the mealy bug lands on the orange it is good-bye, mealy bug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is believed that some parasite will be found that can be used in checking the ravages of the corn borer. A careful study is being made of the parasites preying upon the borer in Europe, from which place the pest came. In the selection of a parasite great care must be taken, because these little ‘critters’ when moved to a new location sometimes change their natural habits and develop an embarrassing taste for some other kind of food that it is not convenient to give them. Every effort is made to avoid a parasite which by any chance might become harmful to plant growth or to the beneficial parasites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Texas has a blood-sucking and disease-spreading parasite known as the cattle tick. A way has been found to control this tick, which is done by dipping the cattle in some solution harmless to them but death-dealing to the tick. It is said that by this method a ranch can be freed from ticks for about 30c an acre, and with much profit to the rancher.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The V ermicelli Department</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">“Vermicelli” means, literally, “little worms,” so the idea that may arise in some suspicious minds that here is a covert attack on the spaghetti manufacturers is without foundation. In an article like this we must say something about little worms, so here goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the most useful little creatures in existence is the silkworm. It comes into the world with a good appetite. Almost as soon as hatched it will devour twice its weight in leaves at one sitting. Wild silkworms, when hatched, climb upward in search of leafy food, but domestic silkworms merely wave their heads about and wait to be fed. (In Japan girls are employed whose sole duty it is to feed mulberry leaves to the silkworms.) A silkworm spins three hundred yards of fine silk around itself when it is nine weeks old, and thus does more to honor its Creator than an evolutionist, in the pulpit or out, would do in nine hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cutworms, of various kinds, do much harm to the food plants of man. The cutworm moth lays her eggs on weeds and grass in the late summer. When the eggs hatch, the worms feed for a while and then enter the ground, where they make a little nest for the winter. In the spring they come out with good appetites and are ready for business. A garden plowed or spaded late in the fall disturbs the nests and kills many of the worms. In the spring they can be kept down by poisoned bait. Some of these troublesome little rascals seem to take a delight in cutting useful plants completely off at about the point where they emerge from the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When worms get into flour or other food in the home, the only thing to do with it is to give it to the chickens. It is no longer fit for human consumption. Some birds will not touch wormy flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In New Zealand are found glowworms which hang suspended in caves by a short thread. When a tiny insect touches the thread it is lost beyond all hope. The thread is wound up into the body of the glowworm, and the insect is then and there taken for its last ride.</span></p>

Meantime, they have relatives, and the relatives have it easy, too. For instance, take Senator Joseph T. Robinson, of Arkansas, candidate for vice-president of the United States, on the ticket with Al Smith. Joseph’s mother-in-law is down on the pay roll as an assistant clerk of the Senate. She gets $2,580 a year; she does not have to work for it; she lives with relatives in Little Rock, on the money that Joe has sent to her. And then there is Joe’s brother-in-law. He receives $2,220 a year; he is president of a bank in Little Rock; he was in Washington once this last year, on a visit. Don’t you wish you had a brother-inlaw that was a senator?

By substituting lazy grilling methods for real police work, our police have become incompetent. And when emergencies such as the Lindbergh case arise, they show how helpless they are at plain, ordinary, groundwork methods.” To the foregoing we merely add that a special telephone line, set up to expedite the search for the Lindbergh child, ran through the woods only twenty-five yards from where the body lay.

It did not take long for ■wide-awake people without scruple to see the advantage in applying the same principle farther down.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The 20th Annual Convention of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(By our Western Correspondent)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font3">UDGING by the amount of noise produced, the two great political conventions held in Chicago in June were the most important of 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But there was a less noisy convention, held the latter part of May, 1932, in San Francisco, which was of greater importance: the 20th Annual Meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Next November, whether the voters decide to retain Hoover and Curtis at Washington, or to send Roosevelt and Garner there, the real misrulers of the country will continue to be the plutocracy of Wall Street, represented by the gentlemen who convened in San Francisco May 17 to 20 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here is the way the newspapers announced the Chamber of Commerce gathering:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Striving to find a way back to prosperity, 2500 business leaders of the nation are in session here today, while the faith, and possibly the fate, of the United States hinges on the outcome of their deliberations.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inasmuch as the outcome of their deliberations was as near zero as anything could be, we would hate to think that either the faith or the fate of the United States hinges on such a support. The importance of the convention, to thinking minds, lies in the proof so amply demonstrated by the speakers that no human power can get mankind out of the mess in which it has become mired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As explained by the various speakers, the matter with this country is just this: The tariff is far too high on the products of business and industry in general, and the tariff is far too low on the products manufactured by the particular speaker or by the industry he represents; there is far too much government interference in business, especially in the business represented by each speaker in turn, and the government is far too slow in interfering with the many wrong practices practiced in the lines of business the speaker does not represent; business is being taxed to death, and every business man everywhere ought to set up a howl against government extravagances and against taxation, and the government should increase taxation (on lines of business not represented by the speaker) in order to have money for unemployment relief and to help the business and industry in which the speaker is engaged; the government should enter into mammoth public building projects in order to provide jobs for the millions of unemployed, and it is a terrible mistake for the government to enter into mammoth public building projects in order to provide jobs for the millions of unemployed, because the government is bureaucratic, inefficient, wasteful, and would launch irresponsible, ill-managed, and nonproductive building enterprises; and so on, and so on through five days of general sessions, “round table discussions,” dinner and luncheon meetings, board meetings, councilor meetings, over seventy-five “able” speeches by “able” leaders in business and industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That some of the speakers themselves caught the incongruities of the situation is evidenced by such statements as the following by Philip P. Gott, manager of the Trade Association Department of the National Chamber: “Business men, and trade associations and other business organizations have, on the one hand, requested assistance from the Government and, on the other hand, have criticized the increasing burden of taxation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the leaders of business are really catching occasional glimpses of what lies just ahead is evidenced by such statements as the following by Julius H. Barnes: “We are perplexed, wondering what has happened, wondering if there is not some great impending calamity hovering over us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> representative sat through as many of the sessions as possible, and could fill pages with his own observations, but lest we be accused of bias, we prefer to quote from the report made to the president and secretary of the National Association of Retail Druggists (one of the large associations represented in the National Chamber), this report being made by Harvey A. Henry, third vice-president of that association and an accredited delegate to the convention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘ ‘ It was a meeting of pessimism. . . . Speaker after speaker representing business of enormous magnitude, speakers who in former years would be buoyant, self-reliant, almost, I might say, domineering in their attitude of hauteur and security, this year addressed the assembly with complete humility; business gods or idols are discovered to have feet of clay. An observer at such a meeting, if accomplishing a little for his trade group, does acquire this picture to bring before his own association: he learns by contact and by listening to the so-called ‘leaders of industry’ that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">every group, every business in America, is in the direst straits, that no cure for the situation, not even a palliative, seems to be in sight. He learns that every trade group, every manufacturing group, is in an era of profitless selling to the extent that millions of people in business, because they are selling without profit, are as truly unemployed as though they were walking the streets, and that they are not at present charges upon the community is because they are operating or living upon the reserves acquired through frugality in other times. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Possibly the most amusing feature of the convention was the fact that practically every suggestion, every declaration which had to do with criticizing the government or which told lawmakers just how the United States should be governed, was adopted and published enthusiastically, while practically every suggestion, every declaration which aimed to correct the glaring evils in the world of business and industry, was either ignored, or killed in committee, or so thoroughly lost in a maze of tactful wording that each guilty line of business would understand that the pronouncement was meant for “two other fellows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of the twenty-two resolutions or declarations adopted by the convention, seventeen had to do with government and governmental functions and only five with business and industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Henry I. Harriman, chairman of the board of the New England Power Association, Boston, Mass., was elected president of the National Chamber for the ensuing fiscal year. In his speech entitled “The Way Out”, he really did make a concrete, constructive suggestion that, if put into practice, would go at least part way toward attaining the ideal that Mr. Harriman set before his hearers: “To substitute confidence for fear; to establish credit and to make it possible to preserve a proper balance between the production and consumption of varied articles.” Here is the pointed suggestion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Guarantee the deposits in our national banks, as an emergency measure and for a period of not more than one or two years. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meager protection, “not more than one or two years,” but at least some protection against losing the hard-earned little accumulation of the wage earner, so often lost in bank failures. But would the censors let this suggestion get by? Yes, by some strange oversight, the speech actually went out to the nation’s press just that way; but some censor lost his job or got a round scolding for that, because a revised copy of the same speech was sent hot-foot after the original, omitting entirely this constructive (as far as it goes) suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Harriman also made this rather remarkable confession, and this did get by all censorship :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The depression of 1929 was caused primarily by a loss of moral perspective and a collapse of common honesty. The Sermon on the Mount and the Ten Commandments will always be the true guide to real and lasting prosperity. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What an admission! What an admission! To those cognizant of the fact that the entire time of trouble in which we find ourselves is the divine method of driving home this very lesson, Mr. Harriman's statement speaks volumes. We wonder why some of the clergymen, who, by the way, were not at all averse to speculating on the stock market back in 1928, don’t come out with equally frank confessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A jewel of an “unselfish” speech was delivered by Oscar Sutro, vice-president and general counsel of the Standard Oil Company of California, on the subject of “The Philippines”, wherein Mr. Sutro presented many strong arguments to the effect that (to quote the last paragraph of his speech) “to grant independence for the Philippines would mean a threat to the peace of the world in the Orient, to the United States a loss of military security on the Pacific, and a surrender of a great and important present and future trade; to the Philippines it would bring economic chaos, if not the destruction of political liberty. It should not be done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, of course, Mr. Sutro did not once mention that to grant independence to the Philippines might endanger the business and investments of the Standard Oil over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here are a few bright paragraphs from the address of Oscar G. Mayer, president of Oscar Mayer &amp;&nbsp;Co., Inc., Chicago, Illinois:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The past eighteen years, sinee the outbreak of the Great War, have been one of the most distressing periods in modern history with the forces of selfishness and ruthlessness in the saddle. This steeplechase has ended in a morass in which we are now floundering and in which we are vowing ‘never again’ . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“But while a garden variety depression would amply serve our purpose in this respect, we find ourselves face to face with a cataclysm, due to a combination of causes, foreign and domestic, which has never before existed: a calamitous war, involving the destruction of hundreds of billions of dollars of property and millions of men, ruthless animosities engendered on a prodigious scale, impossible peace treaties, reparations and war debt payments, resulting in an unprecedented dislocation of the world’s gold supply, which with evermounting tariff barriers, has finally brought about a stoppage of the blood stream of prosperity, foreign trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Add to this the ludicrous developments in our own country during the last twelve years, well exemplified by the tale of a movie director in Hollywood who had taken charge of the filming of the Passion Play. On seeing twelve lean, robed figures with long beards congregated in a corner, he inquired of his assistant who they were. Being told that they were the twelve apostles, he impatiently said, ‘That won’t do. We must have twenty-four of them. This is a BIG production! Gentlemen, we have been in big production in this good land of ours during the past dozen years, but we have done it largely through inflation of credit and a staggering increase of debts which haunt us today. We issued billions of dollars of securities whose only recommendation was that they represented other seeurites (including rights to subscribe) which in turn represented other securities which were ‘unquestionably good’. We loaned billions to Europe in order that they might pay us a few hundred millions in war debts. Truly a comic opera! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But, of course, Mr. Mayer hastens to explain that he does not mean to suggest that the financial powers are really to blame. Says he:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘ ‘ Trade associations should take the lead in pointing out to our politicians and to the people in this country, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">frankness and honesty,</span><span class="font2"> the true economic fact that the national welfare and happiness rests upon industry and enterprise; that aggregation of capital is indispensable to the needs of modern society; that the so-called ‘wealthy’ have become so by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">putting practically all their earnings back into industry</span><span class="font2"> where it has created </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">new work</span><span class="font2"> and that even what little proportionately they spend upon themselves is used almost entirely </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in the creation of employment.”</span><span class="font2"> [Italics ours.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, let’s cheer up with these remarks by Philip P. Gott, manager of the Trade Association Department of the National Chamber:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“With all the weaknesses of our present economic system, we must not forget the fact that the standard of living, the distribution of wealth, and the happiness and contentment of the masses of the people are greater than in any other country in the world and greater than that w’hich exists under any other economic system.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Try that on the next man who accosts you on the street w'ith the plea, “Give me a nickel for a cup of coffee, Mister. Honest, I’m starving.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Worthless Anti-Typhoid Serum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By The American Medical Liberty League (Illinois)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font3">ERE is the proof of the utter worthlessness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■*-A </span><span class="font3">of anti-typhoid serum. Quotation from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association, </span><span class="font3">December 5,1931:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“typhoid at fort des</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> MOINES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The first explosive outbreak of typhoid in the United States army since the close of the World War occurred during October in Battery E, Seventeenth Field Artillery, Fort Des Moines, Iowa, according to the surgeon general’s monthly review of the health of the army. Between September </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font2"> and October 31, twenty probable cases of typhoid were admitted to the hospital. Specimens for examination were sent to the Sixth Corps area laboratory at Fort Sheridan, Ill., and to the army medical school. A report, November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">7, </span><span class="font2">showed 18 cases diagnosed as typhoid, and two as fever undiagnosed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">All the patients had been inoculated.</span><span class="font2"> No deaths had occurred up to the time of the report.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This proves the absolute incompetency of serum-infatuated allopathic doctors. With men so under their control </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that they must submit</span><span class="font3"> to all sorts of medical and surgical abuse or be court-martialed and sent to Leavenworth, these poor soldiers are subjected to such filthy living conditions that they come down with a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">filth disease,</span><span class="font3"> typhoid fever, after they have received the “sure preventive” inoculation. Please note also that this is called the “first explosive outbreak”. But how many single and sporadic cases have there been which had also been inoculated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above “explosive outbreak” of typhoid in the army is just what might have been expected, for in public service health reports, No. 13, Vol. 34, Colonel Walter D. Macaw, chief surgeon of the A. E. F., passed the following severe stricture on his own medical officers for relying on inoculation for typhoid:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It is evident that many medical officers have gained but little knowledge of the fundamental principles underlying prevention and control” (of typhoid).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We heartily agree with him. The poor simps of doctors found that typhoid inoculation </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">did not protect</span><span class="font3"> in unsanitary conditions, and even laymen now know that when the environment is thoroughly sanitary there is nothing to protect from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Farm Board as an Instrument of Oppression</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(From a radio address by John A. Simpson, president of National Farmers’ Union)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font3">SOLD before me the Government report of the hearings before the Committee on Agriculture of the United States Senate, held here in Washington November 24, 25, 27, and 28, 1931. On page 287 of this Government report Mr. Creekmore, head of the Farm Board’s cotton set-up, admitted that for more than a year he has been drawing a salary of $75,000 a year. He has many assistants under him drawing salaries up to as high as $35,000 a year, and the saddest part of this information is that these extortionate salaries come out of the cotton farmers’ 5 cents a pound cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order that you may get a realization of what such a salary means to the cotton farmers of the South, I call your attention to the fact that the average cotton family produces 10 bales of cotton per year. At the present price of cotton it requires 2,500 bales to pay Mr. Creekmore’s salary for one year, which means it takes 250 cotton farmers, their wives, and children to produce enough cotton to sell for enough money at the present price to pay his salary. For Mr. Creekmore to live in the luxury of a $75,000-a-year salaried man, 1250 little boys and girls for several months in the spring of the year must go into the fields with hoe and chop cotton; and again when frost time comes these same little boys and girls must go into the fields again, up and down the rows, little fingers gathering the locks of cotton, many times barefooted and fingers bleeding on cold mornings. All of this is necessary in order that Mr. Creekmore may have $75,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I say to you the Farm Board is a failure so far as cotton farmers are concerned. Any system or policy that develops a $75,000 salary as a burden on 5-cent cotton is a complete failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Farm Board established a wheat set-up and made a country preacher president of the set-up at a salary of $15,000 a year, with an unlimited expense account. They placed a Mr. Milnor on the pay roll as an expert manager at a salary of $50,000 a year, with a number of assistants with salaries ranging from $10,000 to $35,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On page 217 of this report will be found a list of those who are drawing these extortionate salaries from poor wheat farmers in western Kansas who sold their wheat at an average of less than 30 cents a bushel. The first ten on the list average $21,000 a year in salary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To visualize what Mr. Milnor’s salary really means in wheat, I call your attention to the fact that it would take 200,000 bushels at the price these wheat farmers received to pay the salary of this man for one year. Two hundred thousand bushels of wheat would be 4 trainloads, 50 cars to the train, and 1,000 bushels of wheat to each car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The last advice which the Farm Board offered to the farmers of the nation came forth in the middle of summer of last year. I am sure it was their valedictory. It must have cost them many sleepless nights, brains on fire with the strenuous work. It was a most wonderful remedy which they offered. They delivered it to 2,000,000 cotton farmers in the South, and it was for these farmers to destroy one-third of their property. The Farm Board said to plow under every third row. This was a most foolish proclamation on the part of the Farm Board. In it there was no guaranty that the price of cotton would go up after the farmers plowed under every third row; and it had in it advice that amounted to asking 2,000,000 cotton farmers to commit a penitentiary offense, for practically all of the cotton was mortgaged, and it would be a penitentiary offense to destroy it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">(From </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The American Traveler’s Gazette)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font3">N THE first three months of its record-breaking run, the world’s fastest train, the “Cheltenham Flyer”, covered 6,008 miles in 5,2331^ minutes. This is only 7y<sub>2</sub> minutes over the total booked schedule allowed for the 78 daily runs, and it is a remarkable tribute to the consistent running under difficult conditions, due to signal checks and reduced speeds at points en route owing to alterations to the line. The train has attracted world-wide attention, and has reflected to the credit of British railway prestige abroad, both for its speed and consistency and its extremely smooth running.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For Sufferers with Lung Trouble </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Frank Veltin (Oklahoma)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font4"> AM </span><span class="font3">old now, 72, but still active as at 35. I dig roots, gather herbs and barks, and live in the woods. Let me tell you one of the best things for poor humans suffering with lung trouble. Take pine needles, meaning the small branches of the pine tree; take a deep can or bucket, put in some live coals, put the sprouts on the coals and hold the face over the burning pine and inhale all you can. Balsam can be similarly used in districts where it can be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[We referred this to Eric F. AV. Powell, herbalist, and he says: “The pine needle remedy would be quite good. No harm could result, and the therapeutical value should be marked in most, if not all, lung affections. However, advanced cases of consumption of the lungs should avoid the treatment, as the irritation caused by the fumes might cause bleeding. I see every reason why vou should publish the recipe.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Notes from Cook Islands and French Establishments in Oceania, South Pacific</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By S. A. Shepherd (Pioneer</span><span class="font3"> Witness)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font3">S IN other parts of the world, distress of nations with perplexity is gripping the people in these parts and the great contributing factors to it all are finance, politics and religion, overlorded by the Devil himself. Jehovah’s witnesses have been known here but a short while, nevertheless long enough to make the religious merchants mad. On hearing that the Watch Tower was sending a representative to these parts that “holy Christian organization” called the British and Foreign Bible Society promptly radioed the London Missionary Society’s principal in Raratonga, who thereupon warned his flock. However, it served as a good advertisement and helped to separate the sheep from the goats. Later the same gentleman was called upon with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet, and in reply he asked the pioneer witness never to call again, and said that he was certain that we were wasting our time and money in visiting these parts. Quite easily understood, the L. M. S. are now finding it hard to make ends meet and, from what we can gather, this year’s budget will not balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “social” distinctions and classes are very pronounced in Raratonga, premier island of the Cook group. A few “ordinary people” from New Zealand come over here to take up work just as they did formerly and they immediately put on side as though they were of “English nobility”. This makes the place absolutely rotten to live in. However, the day is coming when the proud shall be abased and the low exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Exploration is being carried on in the Cook Islands extensively. The cost of living is 20 to 25 percent dearer than in New Zealand. One glaring instance is shipping freights. The Union S. S. Co. (N. Z.) charge £3 per ton on cargo consigned from Wellington to Raratonga (1,800 miles). The same amount of cargo can be carried from London to Wellington (12,000 miles) for £2-10-0. Passages are “a little cheaper” in comparison, the charges being but 100 percent extra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A new name for the “Hamanites” or “barnacles”, otherwise “roosters”, has been found by one interested </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> reader in Tahiti. “Cockroaches” is the new nomenclature, and is recommended to Judge Rutherford for future reference. The cockroach has a long black “robe” (just as the R. C. Hamanites wear here) and he eats everything that he comes across to keep up his condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">France gave up the state church in 1905. However there is no religious liberty in Tahiti, which is one of her colonies, without the governor's authorization. Lately a pioneer witness was deported from there on the bare pretext of ‘selling books’ (“religious propaganda”, as it was put) to enlighten the people concerning Jehovah God’s kingdom. The governor had refused the authorization without reason after our fully explaining the work. Sydney office then instructed to “carry on”, with the result of the “kick-out” after 2i£ weeks’ work. Seems to be that the “cockroaches” did </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> bit of crawling to the governor, who in his autocratic position said, “No foes of organized Churchianity to be here.” I notice on his letterhead the motto, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.” Where? Not in Tahiti!! However, Governor Jore, who understands English, received on my departure a letter of protest, along with a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">which was mentioned as giving our true position. Wonder if it was referred to “Father” Cockroach for “mastication” and “digestion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of all the above-mentioned, Tahiti is a grand place and there are many honest hearts there, which is more than can be said of many other parts of the Pacific. It is cosmopolitan, and that adds to its interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In closing, as I am sure that Americans and others are usually rusty on geography, let me give you our position. Tahiti is 3,600-odd miles southwest of San Francisco, Calif., while Rara-tonga, where I am at present, is 620 miles approximately west of Tahiti. The population of these parts is: French Oceanic Establishments, 40,000; Cook Island, 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is to Blame? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Thos. P. Gay (Florida) </span><span class="font1">(Reprinted from Fort Myers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Press')</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font3">E OBSERVE that our discharged war veterans are beginning to mobilize. Our regular army is already organized and mobilized in the interest of the money power. We will, therefore, soon have before us two mobilized and opposing forces, two real armies, one armed and the other unarmed, but probably more determined in their objective. It will probably result disastrously if our armed army seek to impose their will on our unarmed army. Anyway, from the very nature of things, the clash of opposing interests is likely to accentuate the differences between these two opposing forces, and cause the “bonus army”, although unintentional on its part, to become the champion of the common people. It would thus become the nucleus around which could congregate all the reactionaries; and the immediate result of the conflict of these two opposing forces might result most disastrously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our attitude is one of strict neutrality. We would not be against the duly constituted government, although we think it is not what it should be. As long as it is what the people want, let them have it. When they see fit to change it, they may do so. One thing is certain, they set it up, and have heretofore supported it. If they find that the strong have outdistanced the weak in the race of life, and observe that they are mostly among the weak, let them become wise. Theirs is the great school of experience, and it has the proper curriculum that will ultimately induct its students into their proper plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one can say that we have no standard of right uses (righteousness); we had a Leader 1900 years ago, whom nearly the whole world professes to acknowledge, and He gave us the basis of an enduring government. It was, Give all. (Mark 10:21) It is recorded: “All that believed were together, and had all things common ; and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.” (Acts 2:44,45, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> This leader also taught: “He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.”—Matt. 23: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the leaders in the formulation of the government chose ta take the exact opposite of these elements of construction, namely, a government in which every one has the right to take all that he can get legally, even though it be everything; and he that shall be greatest among us is he that has the intellectual strength and cunning to make all the rest of us his slaves, who is to blame? Surely not those only who make a success of the system. Are not all who have endorsed this system of plunder, in the hope that we might be in at the finish, equally guilty? For, most certainly, it is only working out its inevitable climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have followed precisely the opposite procedure from that laid down by the Lord 1900 years ago; and we are experiencing results exactly the reverse of the effect of the shedding of the spirit of the Lord upon the world at that time. And yet He declared himself to be the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We do not want a new leader. We want to truly acknowledge the one we have. We repudiated this, our one and only authorized leader, by rejecting His life; and the curse is upon us. We are probably marked for some experiences during the next few years that will rend our hearts of stone and make them hearts of flesh. (Ezek. 11:19) Upon such only can be built that kingdom for which we are taught to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”—Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No; we have no one but ourselves to blame for the mess we are in; and undoubtedly the worst is yet to come!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Snake at the Top of the Ladder</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">July 2, 1932. Editor, The Golden Age, 117 Adams Street,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> for some time now. I believe that I actually could enjoy your paper if you would mind your own business, but I have yet to read an issue where you do not knock some denomination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The June 22nd issue hit the Methodists the worst. I am a convert from the Methodist to the Catholic faith. There is never an issue of your paper that you are not butting into the business of the Roman Catholics, insulting the vicar of Christ, blaming him for the depression, and so forth; making yourself so small that you actually need a ladder to look a snake in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am. as I stated before, a convert from the Methodist to the Catholic faith. My husband is a German Lutheran. Only after studying history did I come to the conclusion that the Roman Catholic church was the church established by Christ. No one talked Catholicity to me. In all the Catholic books that I have read, I never, in any form or shape, found such low statements about other denominations as you are putting out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1 am going to hand your publication over to the Knights of Columbus and then let them take care of you. You will have to prove your statements sooner or later. You have my deepest sympathy; and you well deserve it. People small enough to knock and condemn other people to draw attention to their own dirty work ought to be exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From now on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">keep The Golden Ape.</span><span class="font3"> Do not send it any more! I have several friends, four of them non-Caiholics, who discussed this matter with me. They find your paper just as insulting as I have found it. Many times wh'le traveling I have been handed some of your literature. I always received it courteously, read it, and handed it to others where I thought it would do some good. I did this before I knew the inside of your corrupt work. But just let anyone hand me anything again and he will soon know what I think about your paper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By K. P. Loop (Oregon)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font3">HILE out in the witness work this week I called at the home of an elderly gentleman and, after talking to him a few minutes, he told me that during these hard times he had lost all his life’s savings; that circumstances had arisen whereby a man had taken advantage of him and had cleaned him out of all he possessed, including his home. He got to brooding over his loss until he got to the point where he decided to take the life of the one who had done him so much injury, dust at that time he received through the mail a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet and read it through, and it interested him. He went through it a second time and got the message it contained more fully, and it caused him to see things differently, so much so that he gave up committing the act he was so determined to do. He was very positive in telling me that the little booklet kept him from committing murder. He took some bound booksand will get the rest later. He was certainly pleased with an understanding of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bank Robber Passes Out Colorfully</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">alvatore Arena, one of the eleven robbers of the Hochelaga (Quebec) bank, and prominent Fascist statesman, passed out colorfully. Mr. Arena and his friends murdered one bank messenger and wounded another when they got away from Canada with $150,000 of the bank’s money. Mr. Arena was held in highest esteem by Mr. Mussolini and his friends, but some thoughtless person on Staten Island plugged him with a .32-calibre bullet in the back of his head and it was not until after his funeral that the high lights of his brilliant career came into public notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As was proper for a statesman of the highest rank in the Fascist party, Mr. Arena’s corpse was handled most deferentially. In the first place, as he was a good Roman Catholic, as bank robbers and Fascists are wont to be, he was given a good send-off on his route to purgatory from the Roman Catholic church at Lexington Avenue and Sixty-sixth street, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And as he was a bank robber and Fascist of note, he was not nailed up in a plain pine box, but slid gracefully toward the flames in a splendid white metal coffin, draped in the Italian flag and surrounded by a color guard. Tapers were lighted, to help his soul find its way to purgatory, if it should get lost in the dark somewhere on the way, and nineteen eminent Fascist statesmen accompanied the body all the way to Italy. The guard of honor about his coffin was changed every two hours during the voyage and was maintained day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Italian government showed that its heart was in the right place. Mr. Arena was treated with as much deference as though he had been one of the murderers of Matteoti, instead of merely a killer of a bank messenger. The Italian ambassador, Giacomo de Martino, came all the way from Washington to attend the funeral, and the Italian consul general, Dr. Emanuel Grazzi, was also there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rank and file of the Fascists treated Arena like a brother. At the funeral they lifted their right hands in the Fascist salute and shouted the Fascist battle cry of “A Noil” It is not believed that the widow and children of the slain bank messenger were in the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Fascists know how to do things right. When the body of the bank robber was brought on board the ship that was to carry it to Italy a company of Fascist militiamen received the coffin on the liner and escorted it aft, where it was carried into a section of the ship’s hospital to lie in state. The account says that the room was filled with many floral tributes, including a palm wreath from the ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The only touch of regret seems to lie in the fact that the bullet which bumped Mr. Arena off is said to have been fired by a fellow Fascist and was intended for somebody else. Things have come to a pretty pass in this country when a prominent bank robber and murderer and Roman Catholic and Fascist statesman is not safe from being carelessly shot by one of his own brothers in arms and in the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, there is much of this which is encouraging to those who hope for a dictatorship in America. It shows that loyalty to Fascist principles is not unrewarded. And it may be that as a result of the Roman Catholic prelate’s prayers on Arena’s behalf, or for some other reason unknown to the prelate, or to any Roman Catholic, Arena may not find it so hot in purgatory after all. Anyway, he had a grand party at the end of his trip.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">End of Oppression Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">H</span><span class="font3">ISTORY shows that in all nations the masses of mankind have suffered oppression at the hands of the few. There have always been three elements acting together that constitute the rulers, namely, the commercial, the political, and the religious element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commercial power holds the wealth and uses it, and by this power and influence controls the political element. The political element obeys the dictates of the money powers and makes and executes the laws. The religious element, in all ages forming a part of the governments, has fallen under the influence of Satan the Devil and made the people believe that the few, the rich and the so-called “statesmen”, rule by divine right. All the time the real ruler has been Satan the Devil. It was so in Jesus’ day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God had commanded the priests of the Jews who formed His typical organization at one time to instruct the people concerning His law. These priests, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees, formed the clergy element. They claimed to represent God, but they easily fell under the selfish influence of the commercial and political power, wielded by the Devil, and they became the sons of the Devil instead of the sons of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus plainly said to them that they were the sons of the Devil and were doing his will. (John 8:42-45) Clearly, by that He meant that all men, though they claim to be God’s children, if they do the will of the Devil, are the instruments of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A similiar condition is now clearly seen to exist in the world. The great financial powers control the politicians and the clergy of the churches. They stand shoulder to shoulder, work together, keep the people in subjection, deprive them of their just rights and oppress them. The commercial and political power do the chief part of this work among men, while the clergy support them and try to induce the people to believe that these rulers are working for the best interests of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The real power, invisible, and which controls the three elements, namely, commercial, political and ecclesiastical, is Satan the Devil. It is easy to be seen that if every man tried to do ri'dit there would be no very rich and no poor. This earth produces plenty for all, and there is room for all, and all should dwell together in peace; but Satan, the god of the world, makes conditions exactly contrary thereto and exceedingly oppressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible shows that it is God’s purpose that Satan’s rule shall for ever end. The time of the end is referred to in the Bible as “the last days”. We have now entered into those ‘last days”, and that is the reason why oppression is so manifest now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We see one class exceedingly prosperous, and this kind of prosperity is magnified in the public press. We see the great masses of mankind are not prosperous, but oppressed. At this time especially we see the preachers teaching higher criticism and evolution, denying the Bible and turning the people away from God’s Word and attempting to make the people believe that a combination or league of the nations would bring what they need. The course of the preachers shows that the denominational church systems have fallen completely under the control of Satan. And now note how clearly God foretold this when the following scripture was written :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, de-spisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We well know that in all the churches there is a form of godliness but at the same time the clergy are denying the power of God. The honest people are plainly told in the scripture just quoted to turn away from such. And then in the same chapter the Lord caused these words to be written: “But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men.” —Verse 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many wonder why those who have the power among the governments are so harsh, cruel and oppressive. The answer is that these men are blind to the power that is exercising influence over them. Satan the Devil is their real ruler and oppressor. God, through His prophet Daniel, described how these world powers would reach the great wickedness and oppression that we now see, and then said: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The year 1914, clearly marked out in the Scriptures, shows the beginning of the. disintegration of Satan’s rule. (Matt. 24:3-14) The Lord foretold that the World War beginning then would mark the great turning point. Being blind to God’s purposes, the clergy and the commercial and political elements told the people that the war would make conditions better. The fact is, the war has made it worse for the masses of mankind. Since then there has been great distress and perplexity. The reason God has not ousted Satan before is that it was not God’s due time. When Jesus ascended on high, God said to Him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1) Other Scriptures show that the end of that time came in 1914; and that is why the world trouble began then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The World War stopped suddenly in 1918. It is set forth plainly in the Lord’s Word that then there should be a great spreading of the truth on earth before the coming of the final end of Satan’s organization. (Matt. 24:14,21,22) You have observed that during the last few years there has been a class of humble men and women going from house to house throughout the earth teaching the people concerning the Kingdom of Jehovah foretold in the Bible. All </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font3"> followers of Christ are now doing that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work done, then the great battle of Armageddon will be fought. That is to be a battle, as the Scriptures show, with the forces of Jehovah led by Christ Jesus on one side, and the forces of Satan led by Gog on the other side. It will be a time of trouble such as the world has never known, and in that trouble Satan’s organization shall perish, being completely destroyed, and there will never be another such trouble. (Matt. 24: 21, 22) The Lord is now permitting many people to get some knowledge of His purposes, which will enable them to avail themselves of protection during the time of trouble. “The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> refuge in times of trouble.”— Ps. 9:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time has therefore come for the people to take their stand on Jehovah God’s side and against the Devil. Those who seek meekness and righteousness and look to God for help are especially promised protection in that time of trouble. (Zeph. 2: 2, 3) You will note that the common people especially are informing themselves about the Bible by home study. At the same time the clergy are getting farther away from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God promised to set up His righteous government with Shiloh as the governor. He said: “Unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Gen. 49:10) “Shiloh” means “peaceful one”, and is one of the titles given to Christ Jesus. That government will bring complete relief to the people. Concerning that time God’s prophet wrote: “Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.”—Ps. 10:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The big financiers flatter the clergy, and the clergy speak with pride concerning those who thus hold them up. These foolish teachers claim to represent God, being blind to the fact that they are representing the Devil. “They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips, and with a double heart, do they speak. The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things; who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?”—Ps. 12:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the above words God’s prophet foretells the present condition, and we are able to see how the oppression comes to mankind; and then God adds through His prophet: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord.”—Ps. 12:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The farmers and men who till the soil, the ones who reap the harvest but enjoy it not, the laborers who bring the coal from the depths of the earth, and others who labor to make rich a few, are now crying out because of oppression. Their cries have reached the ears of the great ‘God of battle’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning such condition God caused these words to be written: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth [Lord of armies]. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.’'— Jas. 5:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here God is called the great ‘God of battle’ because it will be His battle, led by Christ Jesus, against Satan’s wicked organization, in which oppression shall be destroyed. Satan the great oppressor will suffer complete defeat, and his agencies also will he destroyed. Then, in the language of God’s Word, it will he truly said: “How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city the Devil’s wealthy organization] ceased! The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked [the Devil], and the sceptre of the rulers [his instruments]. How art thou fallen from heaven, </span><span class="font4">0 </span><span class="font3">Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!”—Isa. 14: 4, 5,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s righteous government is now set up, and it will break in pieces all oppression, release the poor, and bring blessings to the people. “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.”—Fs. 72: 4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Indian Remedies </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Elizabeth Whyte</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font3">HEN I read your article on wheat, in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> it brought to my mind something I heard about it while living in Mexico. There was an old Indian who used to cure cancerous sores with the oil of wheat. He pressed the fresh grains between two hot irons, gathered the drops of moisture on a feather and anointed the sore with it, repeating the process three times a day, with the fresh oil. Scales would fall off, and after a while the sore would heal completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Indians have many useful remedies. </span><span class="font4">I </span><span class="font3">was making a collection of medicinal plants, which abound in Mexico. I got many useful hints from the natives. Strangers often get fever, called in their language, “fievres paludicas” or “frios”; what we would call malaria or ague. </span><span class="font4">I </span><span class="font3">know all about it from experience. It is very hard to get rid of the “paludicas” generally caused by the miasmas from the swamps. The best remedy for the ague is green coffee, well ground and boiled down to about half a pint. One tablespoonful before breakfast each morning until the quantity is consumed and the fever disappears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The itch (“sarma”) is very common in Mexico. A sure and prompt cure for it is a mixture of flour of sulphur and lard, well rubbed in. It cures ringworm also, and any skin trouble that itches. No need to melt the lard on the fire. </span><span class="font4">I </span><span class="font3">cured many Indian boys by first mixing the sulphur and cold leaf lard in the palm of the hand. Mexicans have good sight. They take care of their eyes. If anyone is reading by an artificial light he will cover his eyes for a moment, with his hands, before going out into the air. I lived fourteen years down there and still read and write without glasses. I am 74.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have much to learn from the Mexican Indians. The real Indian never has gray hair. They say, “Cuando el Indio tendra canas,” which is equivalent to our, “When chickens have teeth.” They have a cactus called “Organo”, the juice of which furnishes a fine black dye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They have beautiful white teeth, due, I believe, to the fruits and cereals they live on, for they rarely eat meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a Mexican Indian that discovered the oil of male fern, which kills the tapeworm. It is called “elecho-macho”, and can be obtained easily, anywhere in California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking of wheat, we can see that if the oil of wheat is a cure for cancer, there would be fewer cases in the world if people used the grain in its natural state, without all the cleansing and refining, which eliminate all its fine curative and nourishing qualities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Actual Tuberculin Test </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By G. Nordstrom</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font3"> HAVE been keeping a cow for about five years which was tested and passed as free from tuberculosis. Last summer’s calf was a heifer, and, as the cow was getting old, I decided to raise that heifer and get rid of the cow; but this spring, when the cow and nine-month-old heifer were tested the heifer reacted, but not the cow. The inspector came back after a few days to see if the cow would not also react. The argument arose, where did the heifer get the tuberculosis? It had been with no other cattle than the mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Well, the heifer had to go to the butcher; that was that. As the cow was getting old 1 told the inspector he might as well take her too. So both were branded with a T. I had to sell them to a butcher within twenty days, and the butcher had ten days in which to kill them. When I later went to the butcher to get paid he told me the cow was so bad that she did not pass the inspection that would permit the sale of the meat. He told me further that they kept the cow for the use of the milk for a few days, considering it clean. Even the inspector had his share of it. But I do not get anything out of the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I was told that really bad cows do not react. If that holds good the worst cows are passing the test. One of the butchers said that many condemned cows do not show any trace of tuberculosis when killed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible, Ezekiel and Revelation, are devoted almost exclusively to a detailed account of just how “the heavens shall pass away with a great noise” and exactly how “the earth shall be burned up”, and what shall come thereafter. Until this very time, these two books have been the most mysterious and incomprehensible of the entire Bible because they were written in symbols. But, now that the Creator’s due time has come to unlock their secrets, almost incredible is the simplicity and the self-evidence of their explanation.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">In five most extraordinary books, LIGHT One and Two and VINDICATION One, Two and Three, Judge Rutherford gives an explanation of every verse of these two prophecies, and you will be amazed to find that those things you yourself have seen take place on the earth, particularly since 1914, were all recorded centuries ago and are undeniable proofs of the nearness of the destruction of present-day “Christendom” and the establishment of God’s glorious world-wide government.</span></p>

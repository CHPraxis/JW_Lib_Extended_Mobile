<p><span class="font1">Since the publication of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Book One many inquiries have been received at this office concerning the further explanation of Ezekiel’s prophecy. It is now the pleasure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> to announce </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Book Two, which deals with chapters twenty-five to thirty-nine inclusive; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Book Three, which deals with the remainder of the prophecy of Ezekiel and contains an explanation of Jehu. It is deemed important that Jehovah’s witnesses acquaint themselves with the contents of these books as soon as possible. They are now in course of manufacture and will be ready for distribution about July 15, 1932. To meet the initial and extra cost of composition and plates the Society will deliver the autographed edition of these two books for $1.00. There will be only a limited number of this edition. The regular edition will be ready later for general distribution. In organized companies it will be best to send all orders through the service director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">200,000-HOUR TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From July rceond to the tenth, both days included, it will be the happy privilege of all of Jehovah’s witnesses to again engage in a period of intensive door-to-door sen ice in the field. These special seasons of united effort in the house-to-house work always prove to be sources of inspiration and blessings from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To have a part with all those who really know Jehovah in singing forth his praises throughout the entire earth produces joy of heart and gladness of spirit that comes in no other way. Local company directors are requested, as usual, to prepare the territory for assignments and to have plenty of literature on hand. Let each one, as a good soldier of Christ, make arrangements at once to spend the entire ten days and as many hours each day as possible in telling others the good news of the kingdom, the only hope of the world, through which kingdom Jehovah will vindicate his name.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>GOG AND MAGOG</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Son of man, set thy face against Gog, against him, and say, Thus saith the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH shall so thoroughly advertise his holy name and so spread abroad his fame that every intelligent creature of whatsoever nature will know that there is no other god like unto Jehovah. In these last days Jehovah is revealing to his people in advance of the world the things that they need to know in order to be fully fortified against the attacks of the enemy and to be strengthened in their faith. If we are near the end of Satan’s organization, and therefore near the completion of the work of the faithful remnant on the earth while in the flesh, then we should expect to be given an understanding of whatsoever part of the Bible is needful for the encouragement and comfort of the remnant and that they would have this encouragement to the very conclusion of their earthly warfare.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> There are but two prophecies in the Bible where mention is made of Gog and Magog, and these are the prophecy of Revelation and that in Ezekiel. It clearly seems to be the will of Jehovah God for his remnant while on earth to have an understanding of these two prophecies. It would necessarily include the meaning of Gog and Magog. Revelation shows that Satan and his wicked supporters will be killed at Armageddon and put in the pit or grave, and then at the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ these wicked ones will be awakened out of death and gathered again in force. In Satan’s organization there are those which are designated “high ones”, and which seem clearly to include both spirit and human creatures: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.” (Isa. 24:21,22) The fulfilment of this prophecy has its beginning at Armageddon, and at the end of the Millennial reign these ‘‘high ones” are visited by the Lord and awakened, together with Satan, and are given the opportunity to again show their depravity which leads to their everlasting annihilation.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, 0 Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.”—Ezek. 38:2,3.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">’ The Scriptures clearly prove that Ezekiel pictured or foreshadowed God’s remnant people on earth serving as his witnesses just prior to Armageddon, which people Jehovah uses to give the testimony of Jesus Christ. This testimony must be completed before the great battle of the day of God Almighty. Jehovah tells Ezekiel to turn his face to Gog, the land of Magog, and prophesy against them. This must mean that Gog is in the land of Magog and that the remnant class must bear testimony against that wicked company that defames the name of Jehovah God. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font2"> the first above mentioned text from Ezekiel reads: “Son of man, set thy face against Gog of the land of the Magog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy concerning him, and thou shalt say, Thus saith My Lord Jehovah, Behold me! against thee, 0 Gog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.”—Ezek. 38:2,3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* A dogmatic statement as to what Gog and the land of Magog represent would hardly be proper. Since Jehovah has promised to show his remnant “new things . . . before they spring forth”, we may expect therefore that he will give his people an understanding of this prophecy. (Isa. 42:9) Based upon the certain truths that are revealed by the Scriptures the following conclusion as to the meaning of Gog and Magog is here set forth, to wit: Gog is one of the princes in Satan’s organization, invisible, of course, to human eyes, with a possibility of the power tp materialize in human form. The land of Magog pictures the spiritual or invisible realm of Satan, and includes Gog and all the wicked angels within his division of Satan’s organization, and which “bear rule over the earth”. It appears that Gog forms and organizes a conspiracy against God’s anointed people, into which conspiracy is drawn many other creatures, both men and angels, and including Big Business, the practitioners of and leaders in satanic religion, and the chief rulers of the earth; and that all these conspire and come against Jehovah’s organization, including the remnant on the earth; that such conspiracy is carried out by the commission of overt acts; and this is done after the Lord comes to the temple and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">restores Jehovah’s faithful people, to himself. The argument in support of this conclusion follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Heretofore we have observed that Ezekiel, at the dictation of Jehovah, prophesied against Satan’s visible organization composed of religious, commercial and political elements, and also against Satan himself. What, then, should we expect to find with reference to the wicked angels that are associated with the Devil in his work? These have had much to do with debauching the human race and have had much to do with the ruling of the nations of the earth, and it is certain that they will be destroyed with Satan because they are enemies of Jehovah God. It is therefore reasonable to expect to find some prophecy setting forth Jehovah’s judgment and the execution thereof against these wicked angels or invisible powers. The Apostle Paul calls attention to the fact that in these latter days God’s people will be warred against by these invisible powers and principalities.—Eph. 6:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> The Prophet Daniel describes the organization of Satan, both the invisible realm and the visible part thereof, under the symbol of ‘a terrible image’ (Dan. 2:30-34); that the image had a head of gold, his breast and arms were of silver, and his belly of copper, mistranslated in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font2"> “brass”. This shows Satan as the supreme ruler of his wicked organization with other parts of his mighty organization under him. A part of that prophecy of Daniel reads: “And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.” (Dan. 2: 39) Special attention is here called to the words “shall bear rule over all the earth”. Satan is the “prince” (or chief) ruler of the entire world and is the chief of devils. (John 14:30; Matt. 9:34; 12:24) This supports the conclusion that Satan has other subrulers in his realm, which are invisible to men, and that one division thereof is especially assigned to give attention to the things of the earth. We are informed that these wicked angels have a special grudge against God’s anointed people. (Eph. 6:10,12) There is a direct relationship between wicked angels, represented by the copper in the image of Daniel’s prophecy, and the visible rulers of the earth. (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, pages 289-319.) In Revelation 20: 7, 8 the distinction is made between Satan and Gog and Magog, which shows that the particular prophecy of Ezekiel, chapters thirty-eight and thirty-nine, is not directly applicable to Satan, but that it does specifically apply to one of Satan’s chiefs, and those gathered under him in a division of Satan’s organization. The Scriptures show that Satan and all of his princes go into death at Armageddon and are awakened out of death at the end of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah, and the Revelation specifically mentions Gog and Magog in connection therewith, which would mean the prince Gog and all the wicked ones that have operated in his division. (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 206.) The prophecy of Daniel specifically mentions the prince of the kingdom of Persia and the prince of Grecia, members of Satan’s wicked organization that oppose God’s people. It appears there are ranks of rulers in Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> According to another translation verse two of the thirty-eighth chapter of Ezekiel reads: * ‘ Son of man, direct thy face against Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Thubal, and prophesy against him.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font2"> “Rosh” means “head”; Meshech and Tubal were Japhetic people. (Gen. 10:2) They were engaged in digging copper and trading in it, and also in the slavery trade. They were dealers in precious metals and in human flesh and did business with Tyre. (Ezek. 27:13) “Rosh,” meaning “head”, would therefore well picture Satan himself and also the head ruling power on earth in Satan’s organization. The most powerful part of earth’s satanic organization is Big Business. The prophecy therefore seems to relate to the satanic organization of the earth, the chief part of which is Big Business, and also to other parts of that organization under the supervision of Gog, the prince of the Devil’s organization and that part thereof having to do with things of the earth. These all enter into a conspiracy against the people of Jehovah, and Gog has charge of the execution of the overt acts of the conspiracy. The conspirators embrace both wicked angels and wicked men. The prophecy shows that Gog controls a great military force which is covetous, preys upon and robs the helpless, and persecutes the apparently defenseless. (38: 4,11,12) The fact that Ezekiel was directed to prophesy against Gog proves that the remnant, whom Ezekiel pictures, would not be left in ignorance concerning this conspiracy and the coming assault upon God’s organization which would be in their time, and that the remnant would testify against the conspirators. It should be expected, therefore, that the Lord would make known to his remnant what is meant by ‘Gog in the land of Magog’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Since Big Business has its principal location in the seventh world power, “Rosh,” meaning “head”, would well apply to the seventh world power, to wit, Britain, which lies north of the holy land and which dominates the nations of the earth. It may be expected, therefore, that the conspiracy against God’s people, hatched in the mind of Satan and prosecuted by his prince Gog, would start by the commission of overt acts within the realms of the seventh world power and spread to all parts of the earth where God’s people are located. It is certain from the Scriptures that Gog represents wicked forces which are antiGod and anti-kingdom in assaulting and moving against God’s kingdom organization, including the remnant on earth, and which forces reach a climax at Armageddon. This is further and conclusively supported by the statement of the prophecy in which the Lord says: “ I am against thee, O Gog. ’ ’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Because of the wicked conspiracy against his anointed people Jehovah declares that Gog and his army shall be destroyed. “And say, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, 0 Gog, the chief prince [prince of Rosh] of Meshech and Tubal: and I will turn thee back [derange thee, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser],</span><span class="font2"> and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company, with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords. Persia, Ethiopia [Cush, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser],</span><span class="font2"> and Libya [Put, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser],</span><span class="font2"> with them; all of them with shield and helmet; Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togar-mah of the north quarters [the remote men of the North and all his hordes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.],</span><span class="font2"> and all his bands; and many people with thee. ’ ’—Ezek. 38: 3-6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Daniel’s prophecy specifically shows that in the invisible realm of Satan these princes operate and that the prince of Persia was so powerful that only Michael could overcome him. This prince doubtless will again fight under the leadership of Gog, who is the chief prince of those who have had to do with the things of the earth. Gog’s great military organization operates under the direction of the Dragon and makes war upon God’s remnant. (Rev. 12:17) Gog gathers his forces from all directions and surrounds the people of God, thus showing an organized attack upon Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> Jehovah God is supreme and he has anointed Christ Jesus as his Chief Officer, who will lead the fight of his forces at Armageddon. Since Satan has attempted to mimic God in everything else, and since Satan claims to be the supreme one or equal to God, it is reasonable to conclude that Satan has appointed a special officer on his side to lead the fight at Armageddon; and since Gog is called “the chief prince” of Rosh, it is reasonable that Gog is the one that leads the fight at Armageddon, while Satan as the general sits in the rear and directs it, even as Jehovah directs Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> In the army of Gog and under his command will be all the allies mentioned in the foregoing verses of the prophecy, including angels and men, and all pitted against God’s organization. This corresponds with Revelation 17:12-14: ‘ ‘ And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.” (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 106.) This mixed multitude that Gog brings against Jehovah’s organization, so far as the earthly division thereof is concerned, reminds one of the heterogeneous crowd that now composes the League of Nations, with the British empire located in the literal north and being the chief part thereof, and leading the League of Nations. This organization of the League of Nations is a subterfuge and a substitute for Christ’s kingdom; and since there are fifty-seven nations in the League, and since God’s remnant people on earth represent his kingdom, these enemies of the Lord do now surround God’s people and they are literally hemmed in by the enemy. According to the prophecy Gog himself is located in the north. (38:15) Satan declared he would establish his seat of government on the sides of the north. (Isa. 14:13) This further supports the conclusion that Gog is the wicked angel prince in the organization of Satan leading the fight and that the British empire of the north is the chief instrument in the visible army that takes the lead in the execution of the conspiracy against God’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> The statement of the prophecy against Gog (38: 4) is: “I will . . . put hooks into thy jaws”; meaning that the Lord will lead him and his organization as “prisoners” to destruction. (Isa. 37: 29; Ezek. 29: 4; Job 41:1) “He [the enemy] hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he maketh his arrows fiery shafts. He hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.” (Ps. 7: 13,15, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font2"> “The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. ’ ’—Ps. 9:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> Before the fight comes off the Lord gives the Devil’s crowd fair warning and says to them: “Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.” (38:7) This applies to the entire army of Gog. The League of Nations is supposed to be the special guard of the safety and territorial integrity of the member nations of the League, and Britain is the chief guard over the League of Nations. Jehovah by his prophet declares his purpose to visit this wicked organization, and when he visits them it means their destruction. “After many days thou shalt be visited; in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered'out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.” (38:8) It is “in the latter days” that Gog comes “into the land of the remnant brought back from the sword”. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> This definitely fixes the time for the application of the prophecy, which is after God’s remnant people have been recovered from their being scattered during the World War, after they have been restored, and made a part of and dwell in Jehovah’s organization. “For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.” (Joel 3:1, 2; Ezek. 34:25; 37: 25, 26; Ps. 125:2) Until the time of the restoration of God’s remnant people following the World War his people are described in the prophecy as ‘‘the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste” and against which now Gog leads the fight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> It appears that the enemy will expect to greatly frighten the people of God and also to easily overcome them. ‘‘Thou shaft ascend [come up, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font2"> and come like a storm; thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and many people with thee.” (38:9) The forces of the enemy will be like the Midianites when “they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number; and they entered into the land to destroy it”. (Judg. 6:5) This part of the prophecy evidently is given for a forewarning to God’s people. To be forewarned by the Lord is to be forearmed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> A conspiracy is a wicked device formed to do injury to others. This prophecy indicates that the conspiracy is formed against God’s anointed people for the purpose of destroying them. ‘ ‘ Thus saith the Lord God, It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought.” (38:10) This is further evidence that the conspiracy formed against the people of God is directed by Satan through Gog. This conclusion is supported by Psalm 83: 2-5: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.” The Lord shows that the conspiracy shall fail: “The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought; he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.” (Ps. 33:10) It is stated that the evil spirits like frogs shall gather the forces to Armageddon. The croaking of the frogs no doubt has much to do with the conspiracy. After the wicked device is hatched, the frogs do the propaganda work amongst the people, and help set the stage for the fight.—Rev. 16:13; see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book Two, page 42.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1 T</sup> Then the prophet declares what that wicked thought of the enemy is, but evidently the enemy does not give any heed to it. ‘ ‘ And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates.” (38:11) This shows that the prophecy applies to God’s remnant following the World War, and not to the Jews back in Palestine. God’s remnant, as these appear to the enemy, are now without anyone to protect them; hence they ‘dwell without walls, and have neither bars nor gates’. The organization of Satan, and particularly his chief instrument, does not give any heed to the words of God. They do not believe that God furnishes any protection for his people, and hence do not appreciate his words directed to Zion, to wit: “Praise the Lord, 0 Jerusalem; praise thy God, 0 Zion. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.” (Ps. 147:12-15) God’s remnant trust implicitly in him, well knowing that, “except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. ’ ’ —Ps. 127:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah has greatly blessed and prospered his people in doing the kingdom work since 1922, which is evidenced and pictured by the chattel goods they possess; so the enemy led by Gog conspires to desolate God’s people. “To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.” (38:12) The witness work of the people of God, taking on a wider scope, and being done with an ever increasing enthusiasm, comes to the attention even of Meshech and Tubal, over which Gog is the prince or immediate ruler. ‘ ‘ And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape [faithful remnant] of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.” (Isa. 66:19) Big Business is that crowd that is always looking after self, regardless of the interests of others. Beginning with 1931 the message of God’s kingdom as the only hope of the world has gone forth to nations never heretofore reached and the testimony has been given very thoroughly throughout “Christendom”, and particularly in the realms of the seventh world power. This prosperity and blessing on the part of God’s people raises the ire of the enemy and causes him to act. Gog fears for the League of Nations. Gog and his allies become aware of the message of the kingdom by radio, which is reaching many countries and many peoples, and also of the house-to-house testimony work which the remnant is doing, and no doubt the leading nations will become like the Pharisees when the fame of Jesus began to spread, and who then said: “Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”—John 11:49, 50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>19</sup> For some time the kingdom message was confined to the religious element. Now it goes to the commercial wing of Satan’s organization, which claims to be and, in fact, is the real ruler. “Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to </span><span class="font3">take a </span><span class="font2">spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle, and goods, to take a great spoil?” (38:13) </span><span class="font3">These </span><span class="font2">nations here mentioned were the ones that did commercial business with Tyre which represents Big Business. (Ezek. 27:12-25) No doubt in that commercial center they rubbed up against Meshech, Tubal and Javan and did business in the same market. A marginal note on this verse by Leeser reads: These </span><span class="font3">are </span><span class="font2">“active merchants, who are in the habit of going out and roaming all countries like young lions, and know where riches can be obtained”. We may be sure that Big Business is fully aware of the assault that is to be made against God’s organization. The Devil and his chief prince Gog will see to it that every part of Satan’s organization is brought into action. The commercial barons, however, by conniving and conspiring to injure and destroy God’s remnant will bring them no advantage. If they ever live at all they must become subjects of earth’s glorious King. The picture of the prophecy new shows Gog’s army coming up to destroy God’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> It is made to appear certain that God will not permit the enemy to say that they had no knowledge that the remnant was advertising his righteous kingdom; hence he directs his prophet to say: “Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord God, In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?” (38:14) Jehovah does nothing in the corner nor in secret, and the forces of Gog will have their chance to know that he is causing the kingdom to be advertised and the testimony given concerning the expression of Jehovah’s vengeance upon Satan’s organization. Jehovah specifically commands the remnant of his organization to declare the day of his vengeance and to proclaim his works in the earth and to say that his kingdom is at hand. (Isa. 61:1, 2; 12: 6) “Say among the heathen, that the Lord rcigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. ’ ’—Ps. 96:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> The prosperity of the remnant and their zeal for the cause of the kingdom of God will be enough to rouse up Gog and cause the hastening of his army to the battle. God sees to it that the enemy will receive notice thereof; hence the remnant must now busy themselves-in giving notice according to God’s commandment.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">JACOB’S TROUBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> In the Scriptures Jacob stands for God’s chosen people and particularly represents the regathcred remnant after the scattering of 1918. It seems quite clear that “Jacob’s trouble” means the attempt made by Satan’s instruments to destroy the remnant and at which time the remnant will be delivered by the hand of the Lord. (Jer. 30:3-11) By the prophecy of Ezekiel God also shows the conspiracy and the overt act of the enemy to destroy his faithful remnant which is now engaged in proclaiming the message of the kingdom; hence he caused Ezekiel to prophesy: “And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts [the uttermost parts of the north, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.},</span><span class="font2"> thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, 0 Gog, before their eyes.” (38:15,16) This same conspiracy and the carrying of it out is pictured by the following scriptures: “And he [they, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sinaitic</span><span class="font2"> JIS.] gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.” (Rev. 16:16) “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.” (Rev. 19:19) In recent years the remnant has conducted an aggressive campaign of witness work in the name of the Lord, telling the people about Satan’s wicked organization and God’s purpose to destroy it. The remnant has not taken and will not take up carnal weapons against the Devil’s organization, but they do and will continue to boldly declare the message against it. Therefore the prophecy concerning violence must refer to Gog that comes with great fury against God’s people. The remnant of God’s people have been working hard since the World War “to build up the land” which represents their part of the kingdom work. It is the “holy land”, or holy condition of God’s people now on earth who have been toiling earnestly to improve and make fruitful these kingdom interests. They have not meddled with politics or with commercial affairs of the world. They have been only telling the truth concerning Satan’s entire organization and of God’s organization. This is the witness to the nations and is a more complete witness than the beautifying of the literal land of Palestine could possibly be as a testimony to the heathen nations. The prophecy shows, therefore, that the coming of the enemy against God's people in the “latter day” is when the Lord is present giving prosperity to his people and when God will cause them to know that he is the Lord supreme. Gog and his allies will not repent and turn to Jehovah, but, as the Scriptures show, the Lord God will make an example of that crowd, such as will vindicate his name before all creation. Jehovah is the protector of his remnant, and hence Gog's moving against the remnant forces God right into the fight, because God and the remnant are inseparable. The enemy is ‘ touching the apple of his eye’ and hence the fight follows. Gog and his coconspirators do not believe that Jehovah God is the Supreme One, and that the remnant have his protection, and hence conclude to rid the earth of this pestiferous company called “the remnant”. The occasion of assault by this mighty army of Gog will be the occasion for God to sanctify his name and to vindicate it, which he will do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>23</sup> In olden times God caused these prophecies to be written, and the faithful remnant can now identify the Devil’s organization and know that God does speak against that organization by his prophets. Now Jehovah says: “Thus saith the Lord God, Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?” (38:17) It seems certain that the Devil will attempt to spring a surprise attack upon God’s remnant people; but, being fully warned, and trusting in Jehovah, the remnant need not be at all alarmed. The victory will be with Jehovah and he will vindicate his name and preserve those who love him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> Let the people of the remnant, Jehovah’s witnesses, be very courageous and bold in the proclamation of the kingdom message, knowing that God will smite the enemy in due time. “And it shall come to pass at the same time [in that day, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.],</span><span class="font2"> when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face [nostrils, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.].”</span><span class="font2"> (38:18) This is a warning to the enemy and a message of comfort to the remnant, giving them strength, and they will not back down or slack their hand. There will be a tendency on the part of some to become fearful and suffer distress; but bear in mind that Jehovah is at the helm, that his chief officer Christ Jesus is in command of his forces and will win the victory. Jehovah has caused his Word to be written for the encouragement and comfort of his anointed people, and one of the appropriate promises to such is: “In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also Of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.”—Ps. 18: 6-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> Christ Jesus and all of his mighty host will fight against the enemy. “And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.” (38:21) Gog and his horde will realize that they have met a foe that knows no defeat. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font2"> this verse reads: “Then will I call against him [the enemy] every terror, declareth my Lord Jehovah.” The enemy goes forth to make war against Christ Jesus and his army, but the enemy shall fail. (Rev. 17:14) “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen: and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.”—Hag. 2: 21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> Gog leads his forces against the people of Jehovah that he might take a spoil in their midst. He has surrounded the remnant and expects to destroy them and put to flight the entire organization of Jehovah. God permits this fight to come on.that he might vindicate his name. He does not call upon his faithful remnant, however, to do any of the actual fighting. He tells them to stand still and “see the salvation of the Lord with you”. (2 Chron. 20:15-17) In that fight the remnant will be protected as God declared: “Behold the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.’’—Zech. 14:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>27</sup> The enemy forces, although of one mind to destroy the Lord’s people, allied together in their wicked conspiracy and acting in full harmony, in the beginning can and will be confused by the power of Jehovah and every one caused to fight the other by his side. In a similar way God caused confusion at the tower of Babel; and he caused the enemy to destroy each other when Gideon engaged them in battle.— Gen. 11: 7, 8; Judg. 7: 22; 2 Chron. 20: 22, 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> All creation will have reason to know that the Almighty God is manifesting his power against the enemy. “And I will hold judgment over him with pestilence and with blood (-shedding); and an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and sulphur will I let rain over him and his armies, and over the many people that are with him.”—38: 22, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> This is the expression of Jehovah’s judgment upon Gog and upon all of his forces. (Joel 3:12) “And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, . . . And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague. ’ ’—Zech. 14:12,13,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>30</sup> Jehovah will rain down upon the enemy destruc</span><span class="font3">tive </span><span class="font2">missiles from heaven as he did upon Sisera by </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font2">waters of Megiddo. (Judg. 4:15; 5:4,20,21) </span><span class="font3">“Do </span><span class="font2">unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison.” (Ps. 83: 9) And also as God did at the first battle of Perazim. (2 Sam. 5:20,21) Also at the battle of Gibeon. (Josh. 10: 10-14) And as upon Sodom and Gomorrah. (Gen. 19: 24) The enemy has had knowledge of these examples foreshadowing Armageddon but has taken no heed thereto. The final fight will come and the Lord will make a complete work of it. (Ps. 11: 5, 6; Hab. 3: 5) Satan will see his forces completely whipped before he is chained, and then he will go into the pit.—Rev. </span><span class="font3">19:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>31</sup> It seems that some of the wicked angels are left behind in reserve and apparently in security. This supports the conclusion that “the land of Magog’’ is the realm of the invisible wicked hordes: “And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly [securely, R.V.] in the isles; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (39: 6) It was there in the land of Magog that the conspiracy was formed, and now the Lord attacks the enemy’s base of operations, which would mean both the invisible and the visible base for the carrying on of the wicked warfare against God’s organization. This is further supported by the apostle’s statement: “But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men ... in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.” —2 Pet. 3:7,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah will put an end to wickedness, that his holy name shall never again be profaned: “So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.” (39:7) No more will Jehovah permit his people to be taken in captivity to the humiliation of his own name. No more will he permit his holy name to be profaned by the enemy in any manner. This implies faithfulness on the part of all who get life and remain alive. Seeing that the battle of Armageddon completes the victory of Jehovah, and the preservation of those who love him, will cause the people of God to more fully appreciate him than ever. The non-followers of Christ, the heathen, have been repeatedly told the truth but have given </span><span class="font3">no </span><span class="font2">heed to it. Armageddon will cause all of them to know that Jehovah is the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>33</sup> The understanding of this prophecy will surely bring great joy to the hearts of his anointed and cause them to walk on in the highway with fear and trembling: “Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God; this is the day whereof I have spoken.” (39:8) This scripture suggests that when the prophecy is understood the fulfilment thereof is near at hand. ‘ ‘ This is the day, ’ ’ and this time is made very prominent in the Scriptures. The “day” or period referred to by all the holy prophets marks a great epoch in the universe because it is the time in which Jehovah vindicates his name. It means much to the entire universe, and not merely to the earth. Lovers of righteousness delight to know that we have come to that day, and which is the day that Jehovah has made for the vindication of his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PERTINENT FACTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>34</sup> Events are now coming to pass which strongly support the conclusion that the foregoing prophecy concerning Gog and Magog is already in course of fulfilment so far as the conspiracy is concerned. The seventh world power embraces England, Canada, United States, Australia and other countries. The “high ones” of England, which include, of course, Big Business as the chief part of Satan’s visible organization, together with the clergy and politicians, have prevented the message of God’s kingdom from being broadcast in that land. Very recently the clergy of Canada have begun an open campaign, the purpose of which is to prevent the broadcasting of the kingdom message by radio in that land. They have also invoked what is there called “the lord's day act”, a law enacted several years ago to protect, as they say, the sabbath day and keep people from desecrating it. This act they now invoke to prevent the preaching on Sunday of the message of truth concerning God’s kingdom, and they have caused the arrest and prosecution of many of Jehovah’s witnesses on this ground. Thus is demonstrated their hypocrisy and that they are against God and his kingdom. A clergyman in Boston recently talked too much, even to suit Gog and Satan, and in his eagerness to tell what is about to be done he said of and concerning Jehovah’s witnesses: “We [meaning the preachers and their allies] are going after them and we are going to get them this time.” In Australia the clergy are in an organized movement to prevent the proclamation of the message of truth concerning God’s kingdom there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>35</sup> In many portions of the United States the clergy are invoking city ordinances which were enacted to regulate hawkers and peddlers, and are attempting to bring Jehovah’s witnesses within the purview of these ordinances in order to prevent them from preaching the gospel of the kingdom from house to house. Recently they have caused the arrest of many of Jehovah’s witnesses, have charged them with a violation of such ordinances, and have caused them to be incarcerated in jail. They falsely charge Jehovah’s witnesses with the ‘crime’ of ‘peddlers’ when they well know that these faithful men and women earn their living by labor and spend their spare hours, and especially on Sunday, going from house to house to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom. It is apparent to all who know the Lord that this effort on the part of the various ones to prevent the preaching of the gospel is to keep the people from learning the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom. We may be certain, then, that Satan is at the back of the entire wicked procedure and that his chief officer Gog is leading in the commission of the overt acts relating to the conspiracy. The Lord clearly foretold such a conspiracy in the texts hereinbefore cited and in the following: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. ’ ’—Ps. 2: 2-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>36</sup> The kingdom is here and the testimony must be given because such is the 'will of Jehovah God! The conspiracy already formed, and being led by Gog the chief one of Satan’s princes, is moving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">en force</span><span class="font2"> to close in on the anointed people of God. The fight is on and the victory will be with the righteous! Let none of the remnant be at all discouraged, but rather let them be greatly encouraged. Jehovah is showing his anointed ones the meaning of these prophecies written long ago and for the very purpose of encouraging them. Jehovah now speaks by the mouth of his prophets to those who are wholly devoted to him and gives them further assurance that he will completely defeat the enemy. To Gog and all of his wicked forces Jehovah caused his prophet to say: “And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.’’ (39:3) To his own faithful witnesses Jehovah now says: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.” (Isa. 54:17) Be of good courage and press the battle to the gate! We know that we are right and that victory is certain!</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GOD’S ENEMY ORGANIZES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">I</span><span class="font2">N THE days of Noah our earth was visited with a great flood, the effects of which are still visible in extensive portions of our planet. Only eight persons survived the flood, and that by taking refuge under God’s protection in the great ark or boat that God had instructed Noah to build for the safety of himself and his immediate family. These were carried over from the old world which had perished. Regarding this the Apostle Peter writes in his second epistle, chapter two, verse five, and chapter three, verse six, saying: “[God] spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.” “Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished. ’ ’ This foreshadowed that the world then beginning is also to pass away, and that from this world shall many people be carried over to the new world, which shall then be established with the great Deliverer in charge; and these shall learn of him the way to eternal life. Noah and his family were living examples of God’s power to save those who trust in him. Noah loved God and was faithful to him; and by the experience of the flood God was teaching his intelligent creatures that the wicked shall not flourish for ever but that they shall perish in his own due time, and that only the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">faithful </span><span class="font2">will be blessed with life everlasting. This rule is stated by the prophet, in Psalm one hundred forty-five, verse twenty, thus: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the flood God began anew the work of populating the earth which he had created for man. Genesis, chapter nine, verses one and seven, reads: “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For three hundred and fifty years after the flood Noah lived on the earth, and his children and grandchildren increased. Because Noah loved and served God he would of course teach his children to love and serve the Lord as the only true and living God. Satan was responsible for the deflection of the angelic sons of God, who by materializing as human creatures and intermarrying with the daughters of men had left their first estate, violating the law of the Lord, and who had thereby brought his indignation down upon them. Now God’s great enemy saw and realized what his wicked course had brought forth. After Satan had seen all the wicked ones of earth destroyed, and all of the angels who had left their first estate placed in prison, this should have been sufficient to teach him that he could not successfully fight against God. But he did not learn his lesson. Egotistical and arrogant he pursued his wicked course. While Noah was on the earth teaching his children and grandchildren to love and serve God, Satan made but little progress in seducing mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then Nimrod, the great grandson of Noah, came upon the scene and became a mighty hunter of wild beasts. And now the Devil influenced the people to worship Nimrod. With Satan it was anything to turn the minds of the people away from the Lord Jehovah. Being a powerful spirit creature Satan exercised his power by influencing the thoughts of men, by injecting into their minds evil thoughts. And this he did that he might again get complete control of the human race and turn them away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It appears from the record that Satan’s next attempt was to organize the people into one compact body or government, that he might with greater ease control and direct all the people according to his own selfish ways. The Scriptural record upon this point, as written down in Genesis, chapter eleven, the first four verses, reads: ‘ ‘ And the whole earth was of one language, and one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was the first attempt after the flood on the part of the Devil to organize the people into a government or world power. A city is a symbolic expression referring to a government; and on the occasion above mentioned Satan induced the people to conclude that now they must build a city and a tower. They proceeded to do so. The tower of Ba-bel builded by the people at the instance of Satan was the Devil’s defiance of Almighty God. Clearly this was his method of planting in the minds of the people the thought that they did not need God but that by their own efforts they could provide for their own kind of worship and their own uplift, and could save themselves when it was necessary, which was another wily scheme to turn them away from the true God. The Devil has not changed his methods even to the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The building of the tower of Ba-bel by the people finds a parallel in the course pursued by the evolutionists and modernists. They say: ‘We do not need God, nor do we need a Savior. We do not need the Bible. Our wisdom exceeds the wisdom of all men of the past. We worship power and our own ability to accomplish our uplift.’ Thus the Devil, using the savants and self-constituted wise men, turns multitudes of people away from the true and living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From that time until now Satan has pursued a similar policy of organizing the peoples of earth into world powers and, through the instrumentality of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">few </span><span class="font2">men, controlling the masses. He has succeeded in steeping them in ignorance of God’s great provision for salvation and in turning them away from the path that leads to life. He has implanted greed and selfishness in the minds of the governing factors of the world powers, and by the use of a false religious system, enforced by the strong arm of the military, has frightened the people into yielding to the wicked influence of the governing factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God </span><span class="font2">permitted the people of the plains of Shinar to go to the full limit of their folly. They were building this tower that they might make for themselves a name, which the Devil had induced them to believe would safeguard them from being scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. Of course he would expect to hold them in the vicinity of the tower and the city, and to cause it to be a mecca or place of worship to which all the peoples of earth would look for instruction; and thus he would control them. He had almost succeeded now in turning the minds of the people away from God that they would no longer trust him. Satan no doubt thought that again he had won the victory over God and that now he would hold the people in subjection to himself and would have their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then the Lord Jehovah took action for the benefit of mankind. Seeing Satan again turning the minds </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font2">the people away from him the Lord knew that they would completely fall under the hands of the adversary; and now he would give them a lesson to teach them that Satan was not the true God but that the Lord alone could help them. Here the Bible record is that God came down to see their organization and their power; and then, for the people’s good he changed their language. It will be noticed that, according to the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the people all had one lip. Genesis, chapter eleven, verse one, according to the marginal reading, says: “And the whole earth was of one lip, and of one speech [or words]. ’ ’ Their lip must have been shaped in the same general manner and they all spoke one kind of words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord, by the action which he now took, demonstrated his own supremacy. The Scriptural report in Genesis, chapter eleven, verses five to nine, reads: “And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one. and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Ba-bel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By this experience some of the people might have begun to think that there is a great God who is above all and who is all-powerful. But would the people ever learn that they could not trust the Devil? Would they ever learn that the great Jehovah God alone can give everlasting life and blessings?</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LAWLESSNESS OF RULERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">T</span><span class="font2">ODAY, more than ever before, men and women in every walk of life are called upon to face facts. Sometimes these facts are unpleasant. No longer do thoughtful persons attempt to deny even unpleasant facts; for even when such attempt is made, the facts remain. And so here the purpose is to stir thought and to prepare the way for consideration of the true and permanent remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font2">three primary branches of the government of </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font2">United States are the legislative, the executive and </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font2">judicial. It is well known that fraud and corruption are rampant in every one of these branches. It is true that there are honest men in all these branches of government doing the best they know how; but the honest ones do not predominate, because the dishonest ones control affairs. A member of the United States Senate publicly exclaims:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The most important question before the American </span><span class="font3">people </span><span class="font2">is to take the government out of the hands of boodlcrs, grafters and lobbyists and place its control in the hands of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public charge goes unchallenged that a high official in the president’s cabinet vigorously enforced the liquor prohibition law against some who were caught, while this same high official himself reaped fabulous sums of money from illegitimate handling of intoxicating liquors. There are two classes who indulge in the violation of the law, to wit, the caught and the uncaught. The weaker ones are caught and examples made of them for show. The stronger and more influential are not caught because there is no desire that they shall be hindered in their wrongful course. It is manifest that the ways of government officials in this respect are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the same president’s cabinet another official, whose duty under the law is to ferret out and punish crime, is vigorous and active in the punishment of men who dare exercise their constitutional rights in the freedom of speech, while the same official himself has his hands covered with corruption from bribes received by him that noted criminals might go unpunished. The ways of the government officials in this regard are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another cabinet official, sworn to protect and safeguard the property interests of the people, enters into a conspiracy with wicked profiteers to wrongfully deprive the people of their property; and for this </span><span class="font3">he </span><span class="font2">receives large bribes. The ways of this department are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conscienceless profiteers by fraud acquire fabulous sums of money, a portion of which they use to corrupt </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font2">voters and officials to the end that they may continue to carry on their wicked work. These corrupt and wicked men are really the power of government behind the scenes. The power of government therefore is in the hands of a few men whose god is money. They control conscienceless politicians who pose as statesmen and they are aided and supported in so doing by an organization called the “church”, and particularly by its clergymen. The government founded as </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">democracy has been turned into an oligarchy because the supreme power of government now is wielded by these few. The power of these few men has been made doubly strong following the World War. Great corporations called “trusts”, owned and controlled by a few unscrupulous men, crush out honest commerce, corrupt public officials, and use the so-called “organized Christian religion” as a screen behind which they carry on their wicked works. The common people suf</span><span class="font3">fer, </span><span class="font2">pay the bills, and in vain ery for relief. </span><span class="font3">A </span><span class="font2">member of the United States Senate in 1928 in a public address </span><span class="font3">said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Trusts multiply and the president of the United States does not choose to interfere; monopoly grows </span><span class="font3">fat </span><span class="font2">and the president does not choose to act; combinations are formed and arrogantly pursue their methods under the protection of the government and the president chooses to approve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font2">ways of this government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To carry on the World War the tax burden of the people was greatly increased. The cost of living was also much increased. Since the war the tax burden has continued and increased, and the cost of living has grown none the less. The reckless administration of the people’s affairs is carried on at great cost and expense with no adequate return to them therefor. </span><span class="font3">A </span><span class="font2">few are favored while the major portion of the people suffer. In this the ways of the government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United States patent office is open to the publie. </span><span class="font3">Its </span><span class="font2">records may be inspected by any citizen. Those records disclose that machines have been invented and patented by the use of which the great power produced by the waves of the ocean could be harnessed and made to produce all the heat, light and power the people might require, and that at a very low cost. But these machines have been suppressed and not put in use. What would it mean to the people to have such in operation? It would mean that there would be no further need for men to spend their days and nights deep down under the earth digging coal. It would mean that there would be no coal strikes resulting in the starvation of families while millions of other people suffer for the necessity of fuel. It would mean greater contentment for the people and employment of men on top of the earth tilling the soil that food might be produced cheaper for the people in general. It would mean, further, that the gigantic corporations that manufacture gas and electricity and rob the people for the use thereof would have to go out of business or else furnish the people fuel, light and power at a reasonable price. It would mean that the army of men who shovel coal to produce the heat to operate the machines of commerce would find more congenial employment and more peace and happiness in life. It would mean that the women who stand over the cookstoves would no longer suffer from intense heat while cooking the family meals. The use of these machines to harness the power of the ocean would mean that all the people could have their homes heated and lighted with electricity, and that at a very cheap rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why are not these machines employed to harness the power to produce these things for man? Because the great and selfish corporate interests that own and operate the coal fields and the oil wells and the gas factories and the electric light plants have such a tremendous influence and power that they can suppress them. And the people suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is well known that there is a patented device whereby automobiles can be cheaply operated with the use of a very small amount of gasoline, and others that can be operated without gasoline. These inventions have been thrown into the ash-heap because the owners and operators of the great oil companies have succeeded in suppressing them that their own selfish interests might be furthered. The people suffer as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some time ago there was brought to light an invention by which telegrams can be transmitted over wires very cheaply. The invention permits the transmission of messages over the same wire in opposite directions at the same time and at the rate of approximately a thousand words a minute. To prove that this invention was practical a line of telegraph wires was constructed over a distance of more than one hundred miles and the appliance put in operation. It was exceedingly satisfactory. The invention, however, if employed, would revolutionize the cost of telegraphy; and the great corporations that now control this method of transmission would be deprived of some of their ill-got gains. They had the power and influence to suppress the use and operation of this invention. And the people suffer as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The government issues a patent to the inventor for these inventions and then stands by and sees a few selfish men deprive the people of the benefits therefrom. In this the ways of the government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A member of the president’s cabinet accepts a bribe to commit a wrongful act. The bribe-giver attempts to wrongfully influence a jury to bring about an acquittal of the wrongdoer. Referring to this on February 26, 1928, Arthur Brisbane, a well known writer in the public press, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A certain rich man, accused of bribing a cabinet officer, is convicted of tampering with a jury and sentenced to six months in jail. The average citizen reads the news and says, ‘Nonsense, they’ll never put him in jail.’ Next day’s newspaper announces that the prosperous gentleman plans a trip to Europe, assured by good lawyers he need not worry about the jail for a year, if ever. Had he been poor and convicted of stealing an overcoat, he would be in jail now, and stay more than six months.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The natural resources of the United States of America make it the richest country under the sun. Its broad and fertile fields produce food sufficient to feed the peoples of earth. Much of the soil, however, is idle and not tilled. In February, 1928, a resolution was introduced in the United States House of Representatives looking to the relief of the unemployed. At that time it was reported that four million persons in the United States were without employment. There is sufficient land to employ every one of them if conditions were made half-way favorable to compensate them for labor. The selfish, cruel profiteers make it impossible for many to till the soil and even make a living. These great trusts loan money upon the land at a usurious rate. They manipulate the price of the marketable products so that the producer is unable to market his crops at any reasonable price, and is therefore unable to pay the interest on his mortgage; and he loses the land. He becomes discouraged and seeks some other way of making a living. The corporations get the land, and then those who till it become serfs and not owners. The government does not aid the producer. In this the ways of the government are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few honest men in Congress attempt to pass a law providing for the irrigation and reclamation of other lands. The opening of such lands to occupancy and cultivation would make it possible for an army of men to engage in farming. Big Business with its ill-got gains controls the legislative body and has power to prevent the enactment of the irrigation and reclamation scheme; and the people suffer as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every four years the people of the United States are called upon to select a president. There are two major political parties that put candidates into the field. Both of these parties are controlled by the favored and selfish interests. Candidates for both these parties are named by Big Business, often secretly behind closed doors; and the convention of the people is manipulated thereafter to cause their election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The voters go to the polls and vote; but Big Business wins, regardless of who is elected. Then the government is carried on by and in the interest of a few and against the interests of the majority. It is anything but a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are some of the unsatisfactory conditions that exist in the United States of America. There are many more and worse conditions existing. It may be conceded, as claimed, that the United States is the best government on earth. If that is true and it is so unsatisfactory, what can be said for the governments that are less favorable to the interests of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without a doubt the British is the strongest government on earth. Among its ruling class there are able men, but these men are imperfect and are influenced and moved like other men. The government is not satisfactory to the British at home. The government is less satisfactory to the people of many of the colonies that go to make up the empire. India is a land ruled by the British government. It is a vast country of a million eight hundred thousand square miles, with a population of upward of three hundred million people. India has never had a satisfactory government. Its people have never been united. The caste system that exists in that land has always produced a wide breach between the rulers and the ruled. Some of the upper caste have started movements for self-government and for freedom from the British empire. This is one of the problems with which the British government has to deal. The British have not established and never can establish a satisfactory government in India. If the British should withdraw and commit all the powers of government to the Indians themselves, the upper caste would grind and oppress the lower strata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At home the British government has had a great army of unemployed since the war. Many have been the strikes and other expressions of discontent against the government. It cannot be said that either the home or the foreign parts of the government are satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The peoples of the world are familiar with the conditions existing to some extent at least in their respective governments. Let the entire list be canvassed, from the least to the greatest, and not one government under the sun will be found that is ideal and satisfactory even to the majority of the people under that government. These things are not here said for the purpose of producing discontent; but it is merely a mild statement of the plain facts, that thoughtful men might consider what is the cause and what, if any, is the remedy. If we would deal honestly with ourselves and with our fellow man we shall want to acquaint ourselves with the real facts and dispassionately consider what may be done for the betterment of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCTING STUDY MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While traveling in different parts of the country I notice how difficult it is in some small companies to get a great deal of benefit from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies, because of laek of order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If rules for conducting study meetings as suggested in Volume 6, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font1"> i» </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Scriptures,</span><span class="font1"> are out of date, would it not be possible for you to give us some good advice regarding the best way of cooperating with brother in charge of meeting that we may use the hour set aside for study in the most advantageous manner!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am sure many study leaders all over the country would be glad to get your helpful suggestions on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hoping this is not taking up too much of your valuable time, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your sister in the kingdom service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Julie Hoffmeyer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer, </span><span class="font1">• • • *</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">.Replying to the above letter, the advice is given that the method of conducting a study in the Bethel home, and which has been in vogue for some time, we believe to be the best. The meeting is led by a brother, usually the president of the Society when present. Three brethren who can read clearly and distinctly in the English language are asked to sit in the front and in turn read one or two paragraphs at a time of the matter under consideration, and then the leader calls for questions upon the paragraphs read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Questions are propounded, and various ones called upon to express themselves in answer to the questions; and then the leader sums up by giving a brief and succinct explanation, if further explanation is required. No one speaks until first recognized by the leader. In this way complete order is maintained and the subject matter is considered in the proper way. By first reading the paragraph those in the company get an understanding of the subject matter under consideration; but if their understanding is not clear, anyone is privileged to propound a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of the study is to more clearly understand the Scriptures and the explanation thereof given. This is believed to be the best way to carry on a study, and, indeed, preferable to the propounding of questions to be discussed and then to read the paragraph finally at the end of the discussion. Most companies are small compared with the Bethel family, however. In a small company, the ones who are able to read clearly and distinctly should do the reading. This might be done by the leader himself; and the leader, after reading one or two paragraphs, should say, “Who has a question on the paragraphs read!” Let every one have an opportunity to propound a question that is germane to the matter under investigation, and then proceed with the expressions as above indicated. Questions should always be confined to the paragraph, and not go off on side issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“STILL NEW BEAUTIES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I have not missed reading a single issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">during the past twenty years. I have wanted to write you hundreds of times, and now I can restrain myself no longer. I wish to have you know just how my life has been enriched by the soul food or dishes recently placed on the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has always seemed superfluous for me to write you, for I know that the hundreds of letters which you must undoubtedly receive, in addition to the stupendous task of directing the greatest organization for militant Christianity in existence, must severely tax the physical and mental strength of any earthly creature. For these reasons I have refrained from writing heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am tired telling myself that “this is the best article 1 have ever read”. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font1"> for October 15, which I am now reading for the third time, is freighted with blessings. Only the Lord could reveal these things. I like the outside covei, or rather the front page, very much. A careful study will show that it is packed with potent truths as the remnant by God’s grace is given to understand at this time. In journalism it may be termed the “new dress”; to us it not only is the symbol of our new name, but vividly portrays the artist’s conception of Biblical interpretation based on facts, past and present, and their probable relation to future events. I am in hearty agreement with all of it. I note also that the “watchtower” supersedes the “lighthouse”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lo, these many years God’s organization has ‘stood upon its watch’, and now we know ‘what he saith unto us’; tor at the recent Columbus convention the answer has been made, in thunder-like fashion, to those who oppose us. And now, as if to fire our imagination and deepen our vision by strengthening our faith in heralding the most momentous message since the resurrection, the current article “Remnant to the Front” is set forth. “And still new beauties, and still increasing light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the past seven years I have been led to see that the scriptures those of us (old-timers) thought we understood better are the ones we understood least. With the flashes of light from the temple, Isaiah 35th chapter clearly shows that some of the remnant are of a fearful heart: their knees are feeble and their hands need strengthening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Praise to Jehovah for a knowledge of the “fools” and the “wayfaring man” and “a way”. Heretofore I sang “a thousand may fall at my side”, etc., without a proper understanding. Now, I can say I have no apologies to make for my determination to follow the Lamb whithersoever he leadetli, though there may be many subtle suggestions to the contrary. I am on the Lord’s side. May the Lord’s grace be multiplied on your behalf while you continue to witness for Jehovah until his name is completely vindicated in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DETERMINED TO REMAIN FAITHFUL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At a recent business meeting it was unanimously agreed that a letter be sent you to say how much we are encouraged by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> to maintain our integrity as a unit in God’s army, for it is quite clear that the world needs the kingdom as never before, so that the whole organization of Satan can be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Knowing that we, of all the people in the world, have the knowledge of the establishment of that kingdom, we would assure you of our desire to loyally cooperate with you in the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom which is vindicating the name of our God and Father, the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our determination is to remain faithful to the end, and in bearing the new name of “Jehovah’s witnesses” we shall endeavor to show by our testimonies in his service, and by singing his praises, that we appreciate being members of God‘s organization, which goes forth conquering and to conquer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Praying that divine power and blessing be yours as you seek to lead his people, to do his will, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brethren in Zion,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">•FLASHES OF LIGHT SPUR US ON’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At a recent meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses the following resolution was read and unanimously adopted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We, as a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, most heartily endorse the resolution as put forth at the Columbus (Ohio) convention July 26, 1931. Also, we wish to disown all names that have been used by us and others in the past, and henceforth to be known and called by the new name as shown to us by the Lord, namely, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Tacoma (Wash.) company of Jehovah’s witnesses desire at this time to express our thanks on your untiring efforts in the service of the Lord and also for the flashes of light that come from the temple. These flashes spur us on to greater activity and the great responsibility of telling the good news of the kingdom to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Tacoma company is smaller in number since the Lord came to his temple, yet we are glad to say that there is that peace, harmony, and oneness of purpose as we have never known before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Daily we remember you and those that labor with you, in our prayers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part II</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A DEMON-CRAZED WORLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the first steps toward being entrapped in demonism is to place reliance upon “signs” and thus to stray away from reliance upon God and His Word and seek guidance otherwise, that is, from the demons. It is astonishing in what a variety of forms demonworship has manifested itself. We mention some of the ancient and modern forms alphabetically, and we do not claim that the list is complete. It is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aeromancy: Divination (invocation of the demons; prophesying) by the state of the air or from the atmospheric substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alectryomancy (or Alectoromancy): Divination by means of a cock encircled by grains of corn placed on the letters of the alphabet, the letters being then put together in the order in which the grains were eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aleuromancy, Alphitomancy: Divination by flour or meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anthropomancy: Divination by the entrails of a human sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bibliomancy: Divination by passages of Scripture taken at random.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bletonism: Divination by power of locating subterranean waters, as by sensation. Named after Bleton, a Frenchman, who early in the 19th century claimed this faculty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Capnomancy: Divination by smoke from the altar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Crystallomancy: Divination by crystal gazing. Dactyliomancy: Divination by finger rings. Extispicy: Divination by the entrails of animals sacrificed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Geloscopy: Divination by the mode of laughing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Genethliacs: Divination by the stars at birth. Geomancy: Divination by aspects of the earth. Gyromancy: Divination by walking in a circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is performed by drawing a ring or circle and walking in or around it until the walker falls from dizziness, the prognostication being drawn from the place of the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Halomancy: Divination by salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hieroscopy: Divination by observing the objects offered in sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hydromancy: Divination by water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hypnotism: Control of one mind by another, probably by intentional or unintentional invocation of the aid of demons. The hypnotized person is put into a state resembling sleep, but hypnosis differs from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">normal sleep and breaks down the human will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lehthyomancy: Divination by fishes’ entrails. Lithomancy: Divination by precious stones. Meteoromancy: Divination by meteors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Pessomancy: Divination by pebbles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Psychoanalysis: The Modern Confessional; an explanation of the mysteries of life resting on a sex basis. A so-called “scientific” method of polluting the minds of women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psychomancy: Divination by “ghosts”. Pyromancy: Divination by the sacrificial fire. Rhabdomancy: Divination by means of a wand or rod. It is interesting in this connection to note that divining rods are said to be always made of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wilchhazel;</span><span class="font6"> a curious thing, to say the least, if the demons have nothing to do with divining rods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Scapulimancy: Divination by reading the cracks and burnt spots after scorching the animal’s shoulder blades over coals of fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sciomancy: Divination by consulting the shades of the dead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Theomancy: Divination by the responses of oracles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Voodooism: A form of sorcery, which, in its worst forms, includes murder, human sacrifices and cannibalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Felinomancy—Tunicomancy—lehthyomancy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Burma and Siam cats in the heathen temples are believed to enshrine the spirits of the dead. In Japan they are credited with the power to bewitch humans. Chaliapin, the Russian singer, was unwilling to perform in any theater where he saw a black cat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In ancient Sweden the demons kidded the old Vikings into thinking that in the place where they were going, Valhalla, they would need their best battle clothes, and so it is still the idea in some parts of Sweden that when a man dies after having been a faithful husband, the shirt in which he was married goes to heaven with him. What happens if he wears this shirt out in the strenuous battle of life, is not stated. If his wife dies first and he is married again, he must destroy his first shirt on the eve of his second wedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In June, 1931, a woman, evidently laboring under a form of ichthyomancy brought into the State Hospital, Far Rockaway, a suburb of New York city, a four-month-old baby evidently choking to death. The doctor held the baby by the legs and shook her; a goldfish fell from her mouth, whereupon the mother said she had fed the child the goldfish as a cure for whooping cough. She expected that the cough would leave the child and enter the goldfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catoptromancy—Potiomancy—Voodooism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of August 28, 1929, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> gives the following interesting suggestion as to how people became involved in this particular form of deception:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When people came to use polished metal instead of a woodland pool for a mirror, you can be sure they treasured these as a very intimate part of their own personality. And when glass came into use, what more logical belief could they have than that when their precious mirrors were broken their ghost self too was destroyed? So, if you broke a mirror, you were out of luck with no kind friend working for you in the land of spirits, dreams and mystic hidden things. You would have to wait until a new self was created in the physical world so that there would be a corresponding new self in this world of reflection. In other words, you would have to wait seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So generally did people come to believe that breaking a mirror brought bad luck that they forgot all the explanation lying back of their belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of April 19, 1931, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> narrates the following which took place in Czechoslovakia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The disinterment of the body of a child from a cemetery for the preparation of a love philter marked an almost unbelievable ease of superstition in Zipser Neudorf. A widow named Andrejcak who had a love affair with a railroad employee, Joseph Koory, thought she detected signs that her admirer's affection was cooling. On the advice of a gypsy she went one night to the cemetery and disinterred the body of a child which had been buried the day before. A gendarme meeting her accidentally on her way home arrested her. On hei’ confession that she intended to use the body for secret ceremonies incidental to the preparation of a love potion, both she and the gypsy who had advised her were committed for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Referring to voodooism, in its issue of December 23,1928, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The so-called Leopard Society and the Society of the Tiger bear strong resemblance to the medieval werewolf superstition, which was the belief that witches had the power to change their forms into those of animals. The initiates dress themselves in the skins of animals when they are about to embark upon their mischief. Prominent among the voodoo rites is the inducement of trances and frenzies by the beating of tomtoms, by monotonous chanting, by rhythmic dancing, by fasting and by the use of drugs. So firm is the belief of the savagery in the efficacy of the witch doctors’ power that the mere warning that he has been appointed to die at a certain time is said to be sometimes sufficient to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Epistolomancy—Capsulomancy—Biombomancy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of April 26, 1931, the Atlanta </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> tells of the president of a department store as personally taking the time to forward a chain letter. This letter was in his own handwriting and contained the following sentences, and the other man in this case was simpleton enough and coward enough and enough under the influence of the demons that he did not dare say nay: ‘‘Send this letter to twelve friends within twenty-four hours. If you don’t do this, serious trouble will follow. If you do send it, you may expect good luck.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soothsayers of East India break eggs against a board and study the size of the bits of shell and the positions into which they fall to foretell events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that the most beautiful screens sold throughout Christendom come from China. In its issue of December 23, 1928, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says on this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The original use of China’s beautiful screens was to obstruct and confound devils. It seems that a Chinese devil can travel only in a straight line. It cannot turn a corner. So when it meets a screen across its path there is nothing for it to do but to retire in confusion and embarrassment.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Mussolini a Cartomancer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Atlanta </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> of April 26, 1931, says: “It is well-known that Mussolini never makes an important move without first consulting the cards, which he deals himself.” There are gamblers who refuse to play cards if a dealer is lefthanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the foregoing, it is believed that Mussolini's reluctance at receiving guests is prompted by his fear of being cursed by the “evil eye” known in Italy as “la jettatura”. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Review</span><span class="font6"> in its issue of December 8,1928, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Italy especially the evil eye has been believed in and guarded against for centuries. It is known as “la jettatura” and many persons were, and still are known as “jettatori”, or possessors of the evil eye, who have the quality of injuring all on whom they look, even against their own will. Those who meet them cross their fingers or make the sign of the cross or touch some charm against the evil eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Superstitions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ancient contracts for the purchase of real estate have been brought to light which show upon their faces that the curse of the king of heaven and earth, the sun god, and other gods, were written into contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are some superstitions that seem to have a shred of common sense about them, as, for instance, the one against passing under a ladder. It stands to reason that one is less likely to be hit with something dropped from a ladder if he goes around it than if he goes under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hot cross-bun has no reference to the cross of Christ, but dates back to offerings made, to the gods in the days of Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In parts of Great Britain it is regarded as unlucky for a mine if a woman enters it or if a miner meets a woman when first leaving a mine or leaving his home to enter one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some people are superstitious about two-dollar hills; some think a hangman’s rope is lucky; some actors think Shakespeare's play </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Macbeth</span><span class="font6"> is unlucky; some theater managers refuse to allow yellow costumes in their plays; some think it is unlucky to open an umbrella in the house; some think iron is magical; some are careful to make no gifts of knives; some actors will not sit on a trunk; some dancers refuse to discard old shoes until completely worn out; some think the touch of a gold ring will cure a sty; some think that one who turns over a mattress on Christmas day will die in the ensuing year; some think a book placed at the head of a newly born child will make him quick at reading; some think toothache can be avoided by putting the right stocking on before the left; some gamblers think they change their luck by walking around their chair; some think the four-leaf clover is lucky; some old sailors think the sound of the waves foretells certain events; some persons in the coal mining regions think that when the clothing of a child is buried, the evil spirits go out of it; and some persons think that if a baby cries at its christening it wards off the Devil, but if a baby does not cry it will grow up wicked and cross-tempered.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>All Kinds of Bait</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">But now see what you can get when you are willing to go farther, for just one magazine offers to provide its readers with a training in the following subjects: crystals, ouija boards, yoga philosophy, clairvoyance, occult powers, seership, mediumship, sex regeneration science, dynamic thought, mind power, personal magnetism, mental science, psychoanalysis, metaphysics, ‘‘new thought,’’ mental healing, suggestive therapeutics, constructive occultism, esoteric philosophy, Rosicrucian philosophy, psychic research, theosophy, astrology, numerology, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But that isn’t all. There is a widespread belief in charms of all kinds. Some of these are as follows: Garlic is used as a charm against vampire bats in Bolivia, where they really have vampire bats and where it is perhaps some protection to the people to have strings of it around their necks or the necks of cows, horses and mules; but the odd thing about it is that in Hungary, in the Middle Ages, the people hung garlic over their beds because they believed in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">human</span><span class="font6"> vampires. Quite likely the demons carried this information from the wilds of Hungary to the wilds of Bolivia before there was any visible connection between the two countries.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Widespread Belief in Charms</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and Orientals believed that a precious stone, a piece of writing or a ring tied around the neck would ward off all evil, and though they do not know it, that is probably the reason why to this day women wear wreaths and trinkets around their necks, and why every good Catholic is supposed to do so. In other words, this is a bid for demoniacal protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In rural Denmark, before a new-born infant is put into its cradle, the women place amulets there to prevent evil spirits from hurting the child. Along with the amulets are placed bread, garlic and something made from steel. These are just so many recognitions of and just so many bids to the demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the World War, hundreds of thousands of men went into battle carrying charms supplied by their friends and relatives. Some of these were written charms; all of them, in effect, bids to the demons, and therefore recognition of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the occult magazines there are advertisements of talismanic jewelry. These talismans are made in accordance with old alchemic laws in which each metal is supposed to focus the rays of the beneficent planets. This point will be discussed under the heading of astrology when we get to it, shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gamblers are such believers in luck, that is, in the powers of the demons to control their affairs, that some of them have watch chains famous for their size, and for the charms depending from them. Some gamblers have been known to have a charm depending from every link. Tigers’ claws, rabbits’ feet, engagement rings, lucky stones, medicated rings, love charms and magic squares are all charms that have their devotees to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A magic square is an arrangement of numbers in the form of a square so that in every column and in each of the two diagonals all the numbers add up alike; and this brings us to numerology, which will also be mentioned elsewhere.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Ouija Boards and Planchettes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">One of the first steps in the road to ruin by the evil angels is the use of the ouija board or planchette. These apparently innocent devices, freely advertised as games and sold everywhere, have led thousands of people into demonism. Husbands and wives working together over these things have both gone insane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A woman who became a planchette medium and then a writing medium finally became obsessed. She experienced pains at the base of the brain, her sleep was interrupted, her health began to fail, and the intelligence that had communicated with her took full command of her body so that she no longer was a free agent. Voices sounded in her head, sometimes as many as four at once, talking with one another and freely conversing about her. Some commended her conduct; others blamed her, swore at her, cursed her and called her names so vile that she could hardly bear them. At length they urged her to commit suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font6"> of January, 1929, a gentleman tells us about his experiences with the planchette. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I did not believe all the planchette wrote, and one evening, shortly after I had found out that it did not always tell the truth, I told the company present that I had finished with it and that it was of the Devil and that I was going to tell it so. I did, and you may imagine our surprise when it bounded out of my hand, flew across the room, and bounded back again into the wall, as if it were in a temper. I consider spiritualism to be a serious menace to mind and body. For days after using the planchette I could scarcely use my arm, such power had gone out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil is always bringing out something new to help those who are willing to surrender to him. Thus </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum</span><span class="font6"> of September, 1930, describes the invention of a Belgian professor for receiving supposed messages from the dead, consisting of two glass prisms, a dry battery and an electric bell. This, of course, is merely a modified form of the ouija board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Automatic Writing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From using the mechanical devices of demonism, it is an easy step to spirit writing, but when a man whose own hand the. demons used to produce a beautifully drawn picture of his mother became angry and took the picture and threw it into the flames, he was immediately subjected to torments and was also ordered to commit suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> tells us that there are two kinds of writing mediums: one in which the control is what is termed 'mechanical control’, and then the connection between arm and brain is entirely severed and yet the manifestation is made through what is called the nervous fluids, a certain portion of which is retained in the arm for the purpose of action; but when the manifestation is what is called an 'impressional manifestation’, then the brain and the entire nervous system is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Basil King, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmopolitan Magazine, </span><span class="font6">says of himself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In writing these articles, I am little more than an amanuensis, and I am at liberty to take a detached and appraising view of this presentation of a great topic for the sheer reason that the presentation is not mine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He goes on to say, in effect, that these evil spirits are good Christian Scientists and that they are the ones really responsible for the silly chatter that “all is good, there is no evil”; for when asked why they never expressed themselves on what human creatures call 'faults’, the demons said: “We do not know them. We look upon you and see all the good, never any evil. We cannot perceive evil and are conscious only of blanks when it is present.” This shows that these are not from God; for God declares that His eyes are in every place “beholding the evil and the good”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demons not only have produced writing and painted pictures, but have composed poetry and drawn architectural details. A woman in St. Paul, Minn., in March, 1928, who had never studied Egyptian mythology or had a lesson, revealed a definite knowledge of the days of the Pharaohs. She did not know whence the knowledge came, but we can tell her that it came from one of those old birds that were practicing this same game of deception in Egypt itself while Pharaoh was still alive and on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Charles Hanson Towne, in a copyrighted article in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> of November 24, 1931, tells of his experiences in connection with automatic writing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One Sunday afternoon I happened to be reading a book in my rooms and was quite alone. Suddenly, and for no reason which I have ever been able to explain, I was seized with an impulse to try automatic writing. I closed my novel and went solemnly to my desk. I remember feeling a little foolish as I picked up pencil and paper, for the sunlight was streaming in at the windows. My hand moved indolently across the paper, and the pencil made curlicues for a long time. Then, as if through some force beyond my will, words began to form; indeed, they raced across the page. The letters came faster than I have ever been able to write: “Do not be afraid. I am Cas [the nickname of one of my deceased friends].” I was naturally not a little frightened, but I kept on. “Do not be afraid,” the writing continued, “your sister Minnie has just come through.” Really alarmed now, I asked aloud: “Do you mean that my sister is dead?” “Yes,” the paper revealed. ‘<sup>1</sup> She had pneumonia. ’ ’ Then it was that I made note of the time, as I was sure I had something of importance for the Psychical Research Society. I had such a sister in the far West, from whom I had not heard in a long time. So I put pencil and paper aside, rushed out of the house to the nearest telegraph office, and wired to my sister, inquiring how she was. The answer came in a short while, “Never better. What is the matter with you?” This happened in 1918 and mj<sup>T</sup> sister is still alive. Who can account for such a bewildering experience? I am sure now that Theodore Dreiser was right when he told all us younger people, so long ago, hearing of our “experiments”, not to go on with them. “That way madness lies,” he quoted. And yet, in the light of what occurred that sunny afternoon, one cannot help wondering. I am wondering still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cerebellum of the brain is the power house of the body, and it is from this center that the evil spirits seek control over the reasoning faculties located in the cerebrum, and over the whole body. Contact with these demons causes the victims to lose sleep, to become dizzy, and to have a constant headache in the base of the brain. A gentleman who got into the trap through a ouija board and became a writing medium said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I was ashamed to go to a doctor, so I simply had to weai<sup>1</sup> this uncanny spell off. In my sleep I was tortured by hot, strangling fumes, and a sensation as if something was pushing me headlong over a cliff, and would wake from the sound of pencils rattling. To abuse or bruise the mind or make it the tool of unknown and unscrupulous agents is unhealthy and dangerous business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spirit Pictures and Levitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demons have power to draw and paint pictures, and they can do this either through using the human hand or through making use of the ectoplasm exuded from the medium. They have directed the staging of a play, and they play musical instruments, such as guitars, harps and bells, and produce a variety of other sounds. They do various lifting feats, such as the elevation of tables and chairs off the floor. A mechanical engineer who attended a seance gives the following data:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although a heavy man sits upon the table, it moves about the floor with great ease; or, the table being levitated, a strong man pushing from the top cannot depress it to the floor; or the table moves to the side of the circle farthest from the medium, and an experimenter is asked to lay hold of it and try to prevent its return to the center, but he is totally unable to do so; or the table’s weight can be temporarily so much increased that it cannot he lifted, or, on the other hand, so much reduced that it can be raised by an upward force of an ounce or two; or the table, being turned upside down on the floor, cannot be raised by a strong pull on the legs, being apparently fastened to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same writer, after recording a number of experiments seeming to show the use of levers and suckers of great power emanating from the body of the medium, said respecting the sitters at the seance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sitters supply most of the energy required for the manifestations, and this energy is taken in some unknown form from their bodies. If a person is in poor health the drain of vital energy may be disastrous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After such an experience as above it is noted that the medium comes to himself with feeble, uncertain, scarcely perceptible pulse, a little deaf, extremities cold, sensationless, taking some time for recovery. Sometimes a medium has to cease from seances altogether for a period of weeks.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Control of Voice and Sense of Smell</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Demons have power over the voices of those they obsess and have vocal powers of their own. A gentleman who had experience with them says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They could imitate the manner of speech peculiar to my relatives and acquaintances, and so exactly did they give the particular intonation and inflections of voice that I would have been compelled to believe the imitation to be the real had they not also imitated the voices of some whom I knew to be living. Upon one occasion that occurs particularly to my mind, the voice, style of address, and intonation were so exactly personified that for the moment I felt positive that the gentleman and the lady represented had deceased, and that their disembodied spirits were before me. But when I knew by the evidence of my physical senses that it was not the case, I was then convinced that the spirits were presenting assumed characters. All my experiences with these creatures who surround us in the air sum up this distinct conclusion: that they delight in evil as their chief object, and especially that branch of evil called deception. If any one thing pleases them more than any other, it is to make those in the earth-life believe the most monstrous and absurd theories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> contains a story of a fine singer who was approached clairaudiently by evil spirits who promised that, if she would surrender her will to them, they would make her the finest singer in the world. Alarmed, she refused, and her voice shortly began to fail until now its beauty is all gone; but the Lord gave her the truth instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the demons have the potver to produce impressions on the organs of sight, hearing and touch, so they are also able to affect the sense of smell, and. there are several well authenticated instances where at seances and at time of death and even in insane asylums they did produce odors recognized as sandalwood, roses, violets, and what have been lyingly put as the “sweet, wild odors of the heaven land”, but the truth of the business is that when the origin of these odors is known, the worst-kept barnyard would, to the nose of any honest person, be attar of roses by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Demonism at the Capital</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In February, 1929, Washington, D.C., was said to have seventy-two astrologists, card readers, clairvoyants, cosmologists, crystal gazers, fortune tellers, letterologists, metaphysicians, palmists, tea leaf readers, trance mediums and witch doctors. The licenses cost $25 apiece and are good for a year. Their offices are said to be well filled with prominent people much of the time. If they have only 100 clients apiece, that would still represent 7,200 families, or approximately 30,000 people, and shows the very large influence that the occult has in Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> of February 10, 1929, discussing the various occult (demonistic) practitioners then practicing in Washington, has the following to say about tea leaf reading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up-to-date tea rooms now have professional fortune tellers on their staffs and a reading of tea leaves is thrown in with a meal. This childish practice seems to have gripped the imagination of a part of the feminine public. It probably was not at first intended to be taken seriously, but the fact remains that many patrons in expensive fur coats do take it seriously and go back again and again. The claim is that the “vibrations” of the patron’s hand in holding the teacup serve to arrange the leaves in symbolic designs which, interpreted by a specialist, are significant of the past and future. The tea-leaf reader usually is a clairvoyant, and if the curiosity of the customer is sufficiently whetted by the revelations of the leaves she will reveal more of the designs of the infinite at a private sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crystal Gazing—Chiromancy—Halomancy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is in the National Museum at Washington a globe of glass fourteen inches in diameter and weighing 110 pounds, which it is known that several senators and representatives regularly visit on certain days of each week. What would you think of a “statesman” sent to Washington to safeguard the interests of the people who would spend any time looking in a glass ball trying to find which way he should jump when the party whip cracks ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In July, 1931, there were iu New York city and vicinity 200 palm-reading gypsy camps, or groups of chiromancers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says that no one knows how Hallow<sup>r</sup>een originated, but it gives the following information as to how divination was originally practiced on Halloween night:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man who put a spoonful of salt in his mouth, drank no water and walked away in silence to a place where three crossroads met and sat thereon on a threelegged stool, was rewarded at midnight by hearing a sepulchral voice announce the name of the neighbor who would die within the year. On his return to his home and the water bucket it was his privilege to make the news known, and with the victim’s wife sewing on the shroud, the preacher asking him to prepare and the neighbors inquiring solicitously about his health, it often came to pass that the prophecy was fulfilled. In Scotland to this day the housewife empties a thimble of salt on every breakfast plate before going to bed, and if in the morning the salt has fallen out of shape on any plate it is believed that that individual might as well get ready, for the bell has rang for him.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Astrology—Divination by the Stars</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The idea of the astrologer that Saturn and the moon are evil ‘planets’ and Jupiter and Venus are good ones is, of course, perfectly silly, as is also the theory that all the children born in a given area at a given time will have exactly the same conditions of life, death, love and disaster, yet to our day tens of thousands, perhaps millions, of people are interested in astrology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are a number of magazines devoted to it; some newspapers make references to it in every issue; and some of the so-called great financiers of Wall Street (who are responsible for getting the world into the jam in which it now is) will do nothing of consequence until they have consulted their astrologer to determine whether the move is going to be lucky or unlucky. Some astrologers charge $50 a reading. Some clients are furnished with a daily service suggesting the exact hours which are lucky or unlucky for them. There are astrologers that make incomes of $50,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout much of 1931 a tooth paste company employed a wmman to broadcast lectures on this worse than nonsense over the Columbia network. A book from this woman went through four editions in two months. In the ten-cent stores, millions are invited to purchase little books and to “read the answer in the stars”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God, the Bible, Jesus, and everything else that has any real hope for humanity, is missing from astrology. People look as they look and are what they are because they were or were not born under the influence of certain planets I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in 1928 a large department store in New York city featured astrological silk scarfs, each scarf having “your sign and birth mark hand-embroidered in the corner”. One could also buy zodiacal hats, shoes, hosiery, belts, jewelry and handkerchiefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Astrology in the White House</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One reason for the current interest in astrology is given by the Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star</span><span class="font6"> in its issue of February 12, 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three strange ladies called at the home of an astrologer in the spring of 1920 and asked to have their horoscopes cast. They did not give their names. She told one of them that her husband would be the next president of the United States. This lady -was the late Mrs. Warren G. Harding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No doubt Harding had already been nominated at the time the above-mentioned interview took place, and, without a doubt in our minds, the astrologer either knew Mrs. Harding from her public photographs or was a spirit medium, and the demon in control of her identified Mrs. Harding and the guess that Harding would be elected turned out to be a good one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spiritists claim that Abraham Lincoln was a spiritist; that he frequently attended seances and that the Emancipation Proclamation was the result of advice received at a seance. We doubt this, and think it likely that this is merely another one of their lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, we do know that today there are relatively few of the so-called great men of the world who have any real faith in Jehovah God or in the Bible as His Word. Practically the whole world has been led astray on this subject and is leaning for help upon the doctrines of demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Astrology a Bunk Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The modern science of astronomy had its rise in astrology. Long after the astronomers knew there is no truth in astrology they continued to make some recognition of it because only so could they obtain from wealthy patrons the means wherewith to continue their honest scientific investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one denies the potent influence of the sun and, to a lesser extent, of the moon, upon earth’s affairs and that they pour down sufficient light to make a difference in respect to crops, tides, weather, etc.; but all attempts to identify the stars or planets as having any appreciable influence on earth’s affairs are futile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a custom among foresters that timber cut while the moon is waning is less liable to rot than if cut at other times. It is doubtful if this custom rests on any scientific basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In July, 1927, the Astrologer’s Guild undertook to prognosticate by the stars from day to day the weather for the month of August of that year. The result was a complete failure, as the guesses were right in only six out of a possible thirty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The so-called “astrological tables” are entirely inaccurate, and, indeed, as the ancient astrologers were unfamiliar with the precession of the equinoxes, their months are now some ten days askew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Astrology Is Sun Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The widespread buying of swastikas a few years ago was a recognition of the interest aroused in America by that branch of astrology commonly called “sun v’orship”, inasmuch as the swastika is the Egyptian symbol of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Middle Ages astrologers were assistants to the doctors and surgeons. They studied the skies and fixed the hour wffien the patient could have his arm or leg chiseled or sawed off with the least danger. One of the ancient astrologers advised the faithful that the best time to take a bath is in May. We recommend this to present-day enthusiasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mesmer, the hypnotist, v<sup>y</sup>as originally a student of astrology and naturally and gradually v’ent over into that form of demonism with which his name is associated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Traces of astrology are to be found in the unwillingness of certain actors to start a new play on Friday or of business men to start a trip on Friday or of certain people to call in a doctoi' on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Superstitions respecting the doing or not doing of certain things in certain phases of the moon rest upon a somew’hat similar basis, but some of these it maybe suspected have a moiety of truth in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason a horseshoe is considered lucky is that it bears a partial resemblance to the moon in the second quarter. The horseshoe stands for good luck everywhere, in Hindustan as well as in Europe and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We read the other day of a man’s coming out of his own house w<sup>T</sup>here he had himself tacked </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">horseshoe over the door. He slammed the door a little too hard; off came the horseshoe and hit him on the head, knocking him senseless. Just how that horseshoe brought him good luck, we leave it for others to explain.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Witchcraft and Bug Worship</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The demons have distorted and misused everything in connection with God's wonderful creation. Thus they deceived many of the ancients into believing that the rainbow is a bridge or road by which the spirits of the departed reach their home in the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the demons are back of witchcraft in its various forms is proven by the beliefs and rituals that are common to all who practice it, whether among the Negroes of Africa, the hill tribes of East India, the Devil worshipers of Tibet, the shamans of Siberia, or some of the German farmers of Pennsylvania. Concerning these practices the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of February 23, 1928, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One practice invariably found in all centers of magic, despite the barriers of land, sea, language or race, is that of modeling in clay, wax or some other substance the effigy of the person whom the witch doctor wishes to destroy, and burning the image, sticking pins into it, or otherwise maltreating it. The idea is that the practice will cause the person to suffer and eventually to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As showing the meanness and smallness of soul of the demons, consider how they have deceived the poor Hindus into thinking that if they kill a bedbug they may have put out of business the reincarnated soul of an ancestor. A wealthy Hindu recently left $100,000 for the building and endowment of bug houses in central India. Poor travelers are allowed to sleep over night in these bug houses and are even paid a small sum for doing so on condition that they let the bugs feed upon them, but if they retaliate by actually killing even one bug, they are at once ejected by the attendants and forfeit their sleep money. There are 200 such bug houses throughout India. The demons seem to have exhausted their ingenuity to see how unhappy they could make the poor people of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nobody but the big Devil or the little devils or the big and little ones together could possibly be responsible for the hideous customs that prevail throughout Africa, where ■women distort their lips, noses and ears until they lose all semblance of humanity. Surely the demons responsible for this do it to reproach the Creator.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Psychoanalysis Rottenness</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most diabolical manifestations of demonism is tin; modern curse of psychoanalysis. It is well-known that in the Roman Catholic confessional something like 90 percent of all confessions deal with sexual subjects. The psychoanalysts outdo the confessional. They do not ■wait for confessions, but interpret everything in terms of sex. They have been instrumental in breaking up many happy homes, poisoning the minds of many poor girls, and even spoiling the minds of innocent children and adolescents. For a complete presentation of this phase of demonism, see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 188.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of these psychoanalysts transfer to themselves the confidence and affections of both married and unmarried women, the same as often happens as a result of the supposed sacred but actually filthy confession. There are said to be in the United States about J,000 practitioners of this peculiar system of metaphysics. There is nothing good that can be said for this system. It is wholly evil, and there is no end of harm it has done.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Numerology—from Egypt’s Ancient Mysteries</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">At the present time, numerology is the form of demonism which has the greatest number of adherents. The practitioners frequently admit that this is a survival of the mysteries of ancient Egypt. In other words, it is demonism pure and simple. The patient is flattered, is shown a table in which each letter of the alphabet has a numerical value. From this table is obtained the key number which is supposed to show that certain definite characteristics influence such an individual’s mind. There are said to be more than a thousand professional numer-ologists in the United States at present. Numerology is a branch of astrology, and both depend upon the foolish philosophy that everything on the earth is in some way tied up with the other planets and the stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A mere detail of the numerology swindle is the superstition regarding the number thirteen. Napoleon, Bismarck, and Victor Hugo were all afraid of the number thirteen. There are skyscrapers in New York city which have no thirteenth floor. There are no number thirteen berths on the London &amp;&nbsp;Northeast Railway sleeping cars. The people on Thirteenth Street, Far Rockaway, asked to have the name of their street changed. At a state luncheon in Paris in June, as thirteen guests were about to take their seats, the minister of finance rushed out and got an extra guest so that there would be fourteen at the table instead of thirteen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Path to Insanity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Observers who have paid attention to the experiences of others have noted that those who dally with demonism in any form always lose rather than gain by the process and are eventually left fit for nothing. Even after a disease is temporarily healed by these evil creatures, yet in the end the victims are driven to insanity. Human brains are not capable of withstanding continued contact with these superior and devilish intelligences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thousands of the insane hear voices of demons. They see faces, too, but the faces which they see are not the faces of their loved and lost ones, but, whatever they seem to be, are nothing less than the faces of devils. Surely none but a devil would stoop to harassing poor unfortunate humans who had landed in an insane asylum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having gotten the confidence of their victims, spirit mediums frequently show that they are in the control of devils by the unprincipled things which they do. They are frequently brought into court for inveigling property away from those who have fallen into their clutches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> of July 8, 1930, Adrian Conan Doyle, referring to the death of his father, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We shall always know when he is speaking, but one has to be careful because there are practical jokers on the other side as there are here. It is quite possible that they may attempt to impersonate him. But there are tests which my mother knows, such as little mannerisms of speech, which cannot be impersonated and which will tell us that it is my father himself who is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason for our quoting the foregoing is that it provides the evidence that even those who are most fully committed to the practice of communication with the evil spirits have found from experience, as this young man has found, and as his father most certainly found, that nothing that comes from them is to be believed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A spiritist hymn book contains a warning not to hold seances more than twice, or at the most, three times a week, as to do it oftener has a tendency to weaken the will. That statement is of itself a confession that demonism is the Devil’s own business from start to finish.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Malignancy of the Demons</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Some idea of the malignancy of the demons can be gathered from the fact that once a year at Puri, in Arissa, India, on the roadway leading to the great temple of Jagannath, scores of poor demonized creatures are buried alive as the barbaric car passes. Some remain buried for half an hour, some for a day or more, with their arms sticking out of the ground like so many rows of posts. Who but a devil could want to see any human put through such an experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These devils, both in the Catholic Church and out, make their victims sometimes sleep on beds of spikes. In India they go a step farther and make them pierce their cheeks with iron skewers. Who but the Devil would ever have put it into the hearts of the medicine men of Mexico to pull the heart out of their victim while he still breathed? This horrible thing is still done in Siberia to appease the spirits, but a horse is used instead of a human creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A man who ran amuck in a Polish village and killed six persons and wounded five stated when he was finally overpowered that a devil had placed in his hands the bayonet with which the killing was done. Quite likely he told the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Chicago sea captain who was convicted of murder gave as his excuse that in a dream the previous night he had seen his dead mother, his grandmother and God and had been told that if he went into the street and saw a desperate burglar he was to shoot to kill, which he did.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Dishonesty and Incapacity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The cures performed by demons are worthless. The London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font6"> of February 10, 1931, told about a medium pouring a stream of power into the body of Rev. G. Vale Owen, a spiritist preacher. A medium placed his hands on him and told him he was going to get well, and the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> of March 9, 1931, showed that this preacher didn’t live thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The German police have tried to use clairvoyance in the detection of criminals, but have been able to accomplish nothing, and it is good for the rest of us that they have not been able to accomplish anything. Imagine the conditions that would prevail if the common people, with all the other troubles they have, had to fight for their rights in the public courts against the testimony of these demons, whose word on anything is worse than nothing at all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the fact that he knew that the demons could not be trusted, the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (brought up a Catholic) wanted to see clairvoyance used in police work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The legislators of New York state are so convinced of the dishonesty of the spirits and of their inability to prognosticate that there is now a fine of $250 in that state for pretending to tell fortunes for profit or where lost or stolen goods may be found.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Abuses of Prayer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The British have had to take steps to bring spiritism within bounds. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">John Bull,</span><span class="font6"> in its issue of January 18,1930, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next week the House of Commons will be asked to give a second reading to a Government bill compelling individuals and organizations who collect money from the public to register and to be accountable to the Charity Commission. A better opportunity has never been provided to put a stop to the money-making methods of a gang of pseudo-religious apostles of faith-healing who for years have obtained immense sums of money from the public, and have never divulged what happens to the revenue. They call themselves pastors, and their leaders are three brothers. These men were once miners at Maesteg, in South Wales, but they forsook the perils of the pit for the profits of the pulpit, and ever since have played and preyed upon humanity’s wreck. . . . Sensitive and highly strung people are reduced to a state of psychic intoxication under the influence of the presiding pastor, whose every word and movement is white-hot with hypnotic suggestion. They are seized by a form of catalepsy and incoherent mutterings are heard from them during their shakings and convulsions. Then the pastor proceeds to interpret their mutterings, which he declares to have been uttered by a divine voice: “I am in the midst of thee. Thou shalt give my servant [here the name of the pastor is mentioned] the sum of £----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prayer, unless it is addressed to Jehovah God and is presented in the name of Jesus Christ by one who has the right to use that name, may go to the demons instead of to God; for a certain London spiritist publication advises its readers that before commencing a seance they should always pray for protection and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In London, in January, 1931, the ministers of all denominations were discussing spiritism and had made arrangements for a future seance.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Impostors and Frauds</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The demons take a peculiar delight in making humans believe the most unreasonable and impossible doctrines. Conan Doyle and numerous otherwise capable and intelligent men were deceived by those impostors into believing that everybody is in heaven. Among them, Jefferson, the friend of Tom Paine, the confessed atheist, Mark Twain, the confessed agnostic, and Napoleon I, the master murderer. Roosevelt and Washington, according to these demons, were in the same heaven with Jefferson, Mark Twain and Napoleon. The demon who represented Washington presented to mankind the following gem through a spirit medium whose cheeps were published in the Wichita </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since that time the world has went forward in the arts and sciences by leaps and by bounds. You have bread up better statesmen, you have far greater advantages for education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thoughtful who are familiar with Washington’s stately writings will at once sense that if this report is true then “St.” Washington, not having been properly “bread up” in heaven’s schools, has not “went forward” in grammar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conan Doyle and his colleagues in demonism were led on from one stage of foolishness to another until they acknowledged having been told the idiocy that heaven has among its attractions undulating hills and verdant slopes, purling streams and fragrant flowers; meandering rivulets and glassy lakes, with the wealth of field and forest, grotto and lawn; with sportive lambkins and paradisaical birds; with towns and cities, hamlets and villages, brotherhoods and associations, schools and sanatoria, colleges and laboratories, museums and observatories, newspapers and libraries, theaters and art galleries, temples and towers, chateaux and palaces, rural cottages and stately mansions.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Telepathic Achievements</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">With their superior powers of observation and memory, the demons seem to some people to have very much greater powers than they actually possess. Thus there is on record the case of a father attending a seance who was told by a medium that at 11: 25 a. m., when he supposed his daughter in a distant city was at school, she was instead playing a piano. He telegraphed home and found it true (though he might as well have found it false, because these liars are so absolutely untrustworthy), but he did as a matter of fact find that she was playing at just that hour, having been detained at home with a cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acting upon this and other similar bits of information, Prof. Hyslop, investigator of psychic phenomena, came to the conclusion that telepathy is not a matter of thought waves, but that messages are carried from mind to mind by the spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not know that it is true, hut are informed by the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font6"> that a telepathist, Gaston Ouvrieu, when completely blindfolded has driven a motor car through crowded streets with nothing to guide him except the mind of another person, a passenger in the car. We charge this up to demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one occasion we had a subscriber who desired to present to us evidence that he had discovered that telepathy is a true science. Drawing him out by inquiry we found that in his own case he could obtain telepathic results only when the experiments were carried on with those of the opposite sex. This looked fishy to us, and its having the general appearance of demonism made us conclude not to publish his article. If telepathy is a bona fide, legitimate achievement of man it ought to be operable between man and man as well as between man and woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conan Doyle claims that he and his wife were told of the Japanese earthquake the night before it happened. The explanation is very simple. The demons without doubt have powers of penetration of solids and liquids and could readily discern the tottering condition of the submarine rock cliffs, the falling of which brought about the Japanese disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An editorial writer in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> tells of a vivacious French lady at a dinner on upper Fifth Avenue, New York city, who suddenly stopped, looked behind her and said, “If I did not know my husband was in France, I could have sworn he called me.” Within a few hours she received a cable from Nice that her husband had been killed in a motor crash. Again the explanation is simple. The demons saw the crash, knew where the man’s wife was, and made a lightning trip to America to try to lead her off into demonism and to use the incident to misguide thousands or millions of others.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Heat and Gravitation Phenomena</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">It is evident that the demons understand something about heat and gravitation not yet understood by humans. It is well known that in many parts of the earth witch doctors and others walk across stones that are heated white-hot, and are even buried in white-hot ashes, without being affected in any way. We do not know what the insulating powers are, and do not need to know, and do not care to know. We merely record the fact. It may be that all the senses of the observers are deceived by mass hypnosis, as elsewhere explained in this article. The holy angels also understand how to insulate against heat, for they did so in the case of the three Hebrew children that were cast into the fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have recently published articles questioning the generally accepted theory of gravitation. Demons manifestly understand how to insulate against gravitation, if it exists. To the existence of this power we attribute the erection of the Great Pyramid, the handling of the great stones at Baalbek, the setting up of the statues at Easter Island, and the placement of blocks in the Peruvian fortress above Cuzco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demons have some powers of stanching the flow of blood that we do not comprehend. Thus there are numerous instances in which daggers, nails and knives have been thrust into the bodies of mediums without, at the moment, giving any indications of pain or producing a flow of blood. Just how this is done we do not know and do not care, but that such powers are demonistic and of no possible value to man is very apparent.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Linguistic and Musical Achievements</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The demons have an intimate knowledge of how the human voice is produced, but can and do use some vocal organs more effectively than others, for the very good reason that some people naturally can imitate any sound which they may hear. Throughout the year 1927, an American 'direct-voice’ medium, G. Valiantine, was used by the demons to record on phonograph records messages in old and modern Chinese, Hindustani and Italian, all of which languages were unknown to the medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A similar case of demonism is that of Joseph Schmidt of Austria. When demonized he speaks ancient Babylonian, old Hebrew, classical Greek and Arabian, but in his ordinary state he knows none of these languages, being familiar only with Roumanian and German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably within the same category are to be included some of the musical prodigies that have recently attracted attention. Thus there is Sidney Sherrington, the four-year-old son of an English miner, who is said to have astonished music masters with his piano playing. His parents are spiritists and claim that the spirit of Mozart is using their son as a medium. Mozart has nothing to do with it. If the child has any help from the unseen world (and he probably has), that help comes from the demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite probably in the same category is the prodigy mentioned in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of November 2(&gt;, 1931. The dispatch from Berlin says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A new phenomenon was added tonight to the contemporary roster of musical wonder children when six-year-old Ruth Slenzynski gave a piano recital in the Baehsaal and dumfonnded a huge gathering with her almost unbelievable performances of numerous and exacting compositions of Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Scarlatti, Chopin and Weber. . . . She never began a piece without first looking long and intently at her audience as if to command attention and silence. . . . The power which the child can summon at will seems altogether uncanny, coming from so slight a frame. Her rhythm, sharpness of accent, sense of phrase values as well as clarity, accuracy and velocity of finger work are matters to move even the most skeptical hearer to consternation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>God's Curse on All These Things</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures group all these forms of deviltry in two verses, in Deuteronomy 18:10, 11:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consult-er with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reviewing this passage we see that one who uses divination is one who receives information from the fallen angels by means of omens or oracles. The manner is immaterial. The fact is the important and evil thing recognized in the Scriptures. An observer of times is an astrologer, one who fixes lucky or unlucky days. An enchanter is a hypnotist. A witch is a medium or mouthpiece of the fallen angels or one claiming to exercise power over the affairs of others. A charmer is one who claims to be able to put spells on people or animals; the newspapers contain frequent references to these as brought up in the courts from time to time, not only in France, Italy and other European countries, but occasionally even in America. A consulter with familiar spirits is a clairvoyant. A wizard is one claiming occult wisdom or occult power. And a necromancer is one claiming to hold communication with the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spiritists are quite unable to understand why the churches should frown on the things that they do, because they claim to specially uphold one of the church’s prominent doctrines, namely, that of the immortality of the soul. How very true! The Bible says the soul shall die. The churches say it does not die, and spiritism “proves” ('?) that the churches are right and the Bible wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was Jehovah God that passed sentence of death upon rebellious man. Death is to be dreaded. But for divine power it would mark the complete end of its victim. Spiritism is the Devil's own religion; because it teaches men and women not to fear death, assuring them that life does not cease, that the soul is immortal, and that at the moment of death they go immediately to the spirit world which is to all intents and purposes as nearly like the earth they have just left as two peas in a pod are like each other. It is self-evident that in teaching the un-scriptural doctrine of the inherent immortality of the soul, organized religion is in deed and in truth nothing but organized demonism. Organized religion, as we have clearly shown in the foregoing article, is one of the principal channels by which these evil spirits give expression to their doctrines and find opportunity to exercise their malignancy against Jehovah God, His Word and His witnesses in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The railways, with their enormous debts and rapidly falling revenues, are a problem of first importance. The government has appointed a commission to investigate the whole situation and report as to how best to deal with it. While the report is not yet completed, some idea of the seriousness of the problem may be gathered from the following editorial appearing in the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In recent issues there have appeared in these columns articles considering different angles of the transportation problem in Canada and what is at this time of some importance the shape of public opinion on the subject. W. A. Irwin has an informative article in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">MacLean’s Magazine</span><span class="font4"> on certain phases of the problem and particularly the decline in passenger traffic and earnings in the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact is brought out that the railways of Canada actually carried fewer passengers in 1930 than they did twenty years earlier, in 1910. The total of passengers annually carried in the ten years 1910-20 increased from over thirty-five millions to over fifty-one millions, but by 1930 had declined to a little over thirty-four millions, a lower figure than twenty years before, although there was an increase of 2,800,000 in population. Mr. Irwin gives it in table form:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Passengers Carried—All Kailroads in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1910 ............................................................. 35.894,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1920 ............................................................. 51,318,000</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Automobiles Versus Railways</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">It will be observed that even in the boom year, 1928, there was a heavy falling off from 1920 in passenger carrying. The revenue lost to the railways from passenger carrying is greater than the loss of annual revenue from freights and express. Motor competition is primarily responsible for it: good roads, built at enormous cost, are competing seriously with the railroads, which, too, were built at enormous cost. Most people, when they speak of motor competition injuring the railways, have the motor bus and the motor truck in mind, but Mr. Irwin says, and quite truly, that as regards passenger traffic the motor bus is a relatively minor factor, as the competition is largely from the privately-owned automobile. People think nothing of motoring to Hamilton, Oshawa, Orillia, Midland, Cobourg, Peterboro, Kingston, Owen Sound; people even motor to Florida, and in the summer to Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver. Almost any day one may see cars in Toronto bearing number plates from New York, Michigan, New Jersey or any of several states, some of whose inhabitants love to roam afar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only the steam railways suffer from the private automobile. The suburban radials have been nearly put out of business everywhere by them, and the street ears suffer heavily. A few years ago one could stand on a corner up town in the morning and see a stream of automobiles go by, most of them driven by owners who rode alone. This year on the same corner one will observe that nearly every car has three or four, sometimes six, persons in it, and the same cars will be seen morning after morning going by at the same time with the same passengers. It is possible that people living in apartment houses and due to arrive down town at a stated time are offered lifts by one of them who is driving. This may have helped establish the present practice. And persons employed in the same office, residing in the same quarter of the city, may be given a chance lift by one of them who is driving, and a habit becomes established. Sometimes one man takes his car one day and his neighbor the next. The effect on street railway earnings in Toronto is serious, but there is nothing that can be done about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Speaking further upon the same matter the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font6"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These be strenuous times with the railways. Coupled with the industrial depression comes truck competition. And as if that -were not enough, the short crop in the west, running in part to famine areas, cuts down freight tonnage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Already the two big systems have made drastic cuts in expenditures. But the end is not yet. The matter of cooperation between the systems is being considered by the Government at Ottawa and the railway executives and the near future promises some rather sensational announcements. Just what they will comprise is at present only guesswork, but one thing is assured, and that is that competition in fast trains between commercial centers will go into the discard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Passenger seiwicc has never paid, according to railwaymen. In some quarters it is estimated that the loss qii this arm of the service runs as high as $20,000,000 a year. And much of this loss is chargeable to the craze to give business men an extra hour in some city, an hour the business man probably sits around a hotel and wastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All this frill and fad stuff is to go in the name of economy and is just one indication of how the boom spirit is to be worked out of the railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In passenger trains as in other walks of life, men are going to move more slowly. And the result will probably be that they will enjoy life a little more and live a little longer.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Cutting Down the Service</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The railways, according to Sir Henry Thornton, are considering carrying freight on passenger trains in order to combat the competition of the motor truck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This can only mean a return to the mixed trains of long ago. It also means that passengers will have to sit and gaze at box cars, water tanks and rural depots while the locomotives do their shunting and remake the train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what of it? The de luxe passenger trains to rural points have become a habit, and a very extravagant habit for the railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Railroads, and passengers as well, will have to get back to a less luxurious mode of living or go broke. And in these days when every other man has an automobile it may be that the railways could, instead of carrying freight on passenger trains, work a further economy by carrying passengers on freight trains.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Second Gold-Producing Country</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">While the mineral wealth of this vast country has only been scratched, the results thus far obtained have been most gratifying and the year 1931 made Canada the second largest gold-producing country in the world. The following item from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire</span><span class="font6"> of Toronto may be found of interest in this respect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The gold mines of the Dominion, and particularly those of Ontario, ended the year with many new records chalked up to their credit. Actual mining operations were proceeded with at a record-breaking pace and most of the producers carried their development to new low levels and in almost every instance the mineral zones, where opened up at depth, proved to run higher in gold per ton than on the upper horizons and generally there was favorable enlargement of the mineralized sections. While all companies are engaged in mine development on an expanding scale, the majority have merely started their big programs and there is no doubt that the present year will see even greater improvement, both in development and production of precious metal, than was reached in the record year 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1931 closed with Canada secure in her position as the second largest gold-producing country of the world. According to figures issued by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, total production from all mines in this country amounted to 2,679,728 fine ounces of gold, with a value of $55,394,892. The above figures not only make a new all-time record for the Dominion, but indicate an increase in production of gold of over half a million ounces when compared with the record made in the year immediately preceding. The production figures here referred to do not include the premium received by the gold-mining companies, due to the current rate of exchange. With the exception of British Columbia and Nova Scotia, all the gold-producing provinces of Canada registered substantial gains in output of precious metal. At this time there is every reason to believe that the present year will show even greater improvement in yellow metal production than that recorded in 1931.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>The Cigarette Curse</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Ottawa </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> gives us the following illuminating item concerning the hold cigarette smoking has upon the people of this land. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember way back when a man smoking a cigarette was all but suspect by his friends? Well, last year, according to a bulletin of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canadians smoked 5,000,000,000 cigarettes, paid $50,000,000 for them. Or thereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1913 our total cigarette consumption was less than 1,000,000,000. By the end of the war we were smoking 2,000,000,000; by 1926 we were close to the 3,000,000,000 mark; in 1928 we had got to 4,000,000,000, and now we are up to 5,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a matter of fact, we are probably consuming many more than that. The figures given by the Bureau of Statistics include only those cigarettes which are manufactured in Canada; takes no account of the imports of British and American brands; takes no account of smuggling. Actual imports are likely light, but, if we are to believe Canadian manufacturers who appeared last year before the Tariff Board, nearly a billion American cigarettes are smuggled across the border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If there are 6,000,000 persons in Canada over fifteen years of age, then they are averaging, smokers and non-smokers, over 800 cigarettes apiece per year. About forty packages per head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fifty million dollars looks like a lot of money to spend on cigarettes, yet it is not as bad as it looks. For the money, really, doesn’t go up in smoke. A lot of it goes to our tobacco growers, a lot more of it goes to thousands of workers in tobacco factories, some of it goes to wholesalers and retailers, a share of it to advertising mediums, a goodly share of it into a hard-pressed treasury.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Babies Have a Right to Cry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">That babies have a perfect right to cry has been wisely determined by a very learned judge, according to a Canadian Press Despatch which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Crying is a normal occupation for a normal baby, and is not ground for canceling an apartment lease, it has been decided by Mr. Justice Archambault in the Circuit Court, in dismissing an action taken by Credit General, Inc., against II. H. Lewis, father of the baby. The plaintiff said that the baby, aged 1| years, was continually crying and disturbing adjoining tenants. Under the terms of the lease, the tenant was bound to see that no such annoyance should emanate from his apartment, it was claimed. The father suggested that to put such an interpretation on the lease would be contrary to the essential principles of humanity.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Overgovernment</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Canadian press has much to say today, and properly so, concerning the fact that Canadians are much overgoverned. The following item is culled from the Brantford </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Expositor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The legislatures of the various provinces are entirely too large for the population, and the axe could be used in the provincial fields with good effect. It is just a question of how long business can prosper and carry the enormous burdens of taxation imposed upon it in this country. This, in the end, comes out of the people. The present depression has afforded a splendid opportunity for a thorough investigation of this whole question, but little attention has been paid to it. It remains, therefore, for the people of Canada, through sheer force of public opinion, to demand of their rulers, both federal and provincial, that they take action to reduce the cost of government throughout the country. If government in the Dominion costs $1,000,000,000, it means that every man, woman and child is taxed $100 for this purpose. This is an appalling sum, and out of all proportion to the services rendered.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>A Mixed Family</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The Millennium is surely here, for the time has come when kittens and little chicks lie down together, if the following news item from Sarnia is true. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A hen owned by Russell German of Moorctown, which, in addition to mothering a brood of eleven little chicks, is attracting unusual attention since she has taken five small kittens under her wing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mother of the kittens died a few days ago and every night the chicks and kittens nestle up under the wings of the hen. During the day it is a common sight to see the little chicks and kittens drinking milk together from the same dish while the old hen sits contentedly by clucking to her unusual family.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Mixed Farming</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking of the development of mixed farming in the Canadian West the Ottawa </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal </span><span class="font6">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So much has been heard about western wheat, most of us have an idea that wheat is the West’s sole product. The idea is profoundly wrong. We pick up an official bulletin, and we find:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That Saskatchewan last year produced 30,000,000 eggs, had a poultry production of $30,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That Manitoba produces one-third of the annual honey crop of Canada, ranking second only to Ontario ; and that Alberta and Saskatchewan are coming along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That most western cities are now surrounded by extensive market gardens, grow most of their own vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That the west is now producing some of the finest of Canadian strawberries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> ‘ That sugar beets are now grown extensively on irrigated land in southern Alberta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That the sugar beet factory at Raymond, Alberta, is now the largest in Canada, having turned out 25,000,000 pounds of refined sugar from last year’s beet crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“People are forever advising the prairies to go in for mixed farming. Perhaps it is because they don’t realize how much mixed farming has been gone in for. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, mixed farming does not appear to be the solution to the present distress, although it will help the farmer to better feed himself and family, as the following item from the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font6"> reveals:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Vegetable farming is having its gloomy days in the Port Credit district. R. Hill, a farmer on Indian Road, speaking to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font4"> reported that some days ago he shipped 72 eleven-quart baskets of mixed vegetables to Toronto. The baskets cost him eight cents each, or a total of $5.76. Yesterday he received word from the commission agent at Toronto that he owed the sum of $3.56 on the shipment, as his consignment had, according to the card received, been “dumped”, and not sold. The baskets are now being returned to him, but before he can have them he must pay the express company another $3.60 for carriage. Hill already this season has shipped some 1,500 baskets of fruit and vegetables to Toronto, and his receipts fox* the lot are less than $100.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>A Drought Commission</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The government of Saskatchewan has appointed a commission to investigate the causes of drought during the past three years in southern Saskatchewan. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix, </span><span class="font6">speaking editorially thereof, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A wonderful opportunity lies before the drought commission recently appointed by the provincial government to study the causes of drought in southern Saskatchewan and the possibility of preventing the continuance or recurrence of that misfortune. Their efforts may result in action which will restore that district to a condition of fertility and prosperity and bring happiness and contentment to the thousands of farmers who have occupied it for so many years. The government action will meet with public approval, and the commissioners, who are undertaking the task without remuneration, will receive the thanks of the people of this province for the public-spiritedness which they are showing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time was when an overabundance or a lack of rain was considered as being ‘an act of nature’, the changing of which it was useless to attempt. The study of climatic conditions and weather along scientific lines has revealed some of the causes and that those causes may in part be controlled. Thus the absence of trees allows the too rapid evaporation of moisture from the soil. The absence of lakes, sloughs and other bodies of water means that there is no reserve supply from which nature can draw the rain so necessary for crop growth. Continuous tilling removes fiber from the soil, allowing it to drift before the wind. These are only a few of the known causes. There are many others. These can be controlled. Trees and shrubs can be planted. Sloughs which have been drained can be restored, and the flow of rivers may be arrested to form lakes which will constitute a reserve supply of water; and in some cases it is possible that water courses may be partly diverted to provide irrigation. All these matters will come under the attention of the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The districts of southern Saskatchewan now burned out have not always been dry. For 20 years or more they produced some of the best crops in the west. Then came three dry years. Possibly the climate will normally return to its former state, but if nature can be aided by the arts and sciences of man, so much the better. And if a recurrence of the dry conditions can be prevented, a wonderful work will have been performed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>Mixed Religionists</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">At a recent meeting of the Saskatoon Ministerial Association the question of having passages from the Bible read, without comment, by the teacher as an opening exercise was considered. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> reports the matter in much detail and we quote therefrom in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Ontario a similar plan has been adopted by a number of cities, and a series of consecutive readings drawn up, said Canon Armitage. If Catholic school boards preferred, he could sec no objection to these passages’ being read from the version authorized by the Roman Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rev. James Strahan of the First Baptist church preferred that such readings should contain passages from the writings of Buddha and Confucius. Rev. J. A. Donnell agreed, urging that every religion was seeking after God and that Christianity should not be treated as the only religion. They should be careful not to try to force the children of the conscientious atheist to listen to instruction in religious belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the Christian churches were making converts more rapidly in Africa than in any other mission field, the Mohammedans were making converts even more rapidly, reported Rev. A. W. Banfield, of the British and Foreign Bible Society. To the mind of the African, Mohammedanism, with its allowance of plurality of wives and its charms and amulets had a special appeal. A man with only one wife had no social standing in an African village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Milwaukee Not Hard Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font6">ILWAUKEE, where tliey have a socialist administration of the city, reports that all city bills are paid and there is a surplus of $2,234,000 in the municipal treasury. It is still easy to remember -when several newly elected members of the New York legislature were deliberately thrown out of the chamber to which they had been chosen, and the only reason assigned was that they were socialists. Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., was a member of the legislature that performed this feat of statesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayers for the Creative Spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Federal Council of Churches in its appeal for prayer for the Arms Conference asks, “Let us pray that the creative spirit may move among the peoples.” America has an amphibian tank, bombproof and gasproof, that will go ten miles an hour in the water, fifty miles on a rough road, and seventy miles an hour on a smooth road. It has the Akron, able to carry a flock of airplanes around the world. Russia has 20,000,000 men and women well militarized. Italy has offered to blacken the skies with planes. Japan has 32 airplane squadrons. The German Junkers project a plane that will fly from Berlin to New York between breakfast and dinner. The Big Bertha can shoot 75 miles. In America the influential are given stock in munition plants. There are varieties of poison gas against which no mask is any protection. Our latest machine guns will shoot SOO bullets a minute and all the bullets will go nine miles. We can guide our bombing planes by wireless. Creative spirit? Creative spirit? What more do we want? If war comes we can create thousands of chaplains over night ready to bless it all.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Truth Sometimes Comes to the Surface Quickly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Chas. T. Betts (Ohio)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE poisoning of the American public goes constantly on. Reports come in daily from some part of America, showing same symptoms, even though the best foods have been carefully selected and prepared by the most careful process. Manufacturers of aluminum kitchenware continue to advertise that those opposed to the manufacture of aluminum cooking utensils are wrong, in spite of the fact that the reports show that such ware is used previous to 99 percent of all group poisoning cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find it very difficult to ascertain the exact facts in most of these cases, but here is one which took very little time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font6"> reported on January 2,1932, the group poisoning of Mrs. Frank Reyas, 109 Lyricway, McKeesport, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">HOLIDAY DINNER POISONS FAMILY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Parents and Two Children at McKeesport Made Ill Are Taken to Hospital</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New Year’s dinner at the home of Frank Reyas of 119 Lyricway, McKeesport, resulted in the poisoning of Reyas, his wife and their two children. Physicians at the McKeesport Hospital said the illness was caused by eating either vegetable soup or fruit cake. None are believed to be. in a serious condition, according to hospital authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following letter was at once forwarded to Mrs. Reyas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of your friends forwarded us the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font4"> which contains the report of your food poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are interested in determining the cause of the plague upon our people at this time. Reports of this kind are coming in from every section of America, showing thousands of persons being poisoned. And in no case have the authorities found the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe that we know the exact cause in many instances, but are continuing our investigation of all poisoning cases coming before us, so we desire a report from you personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kindly advise us by return mail on the back of this letter what kind of cooking utensils were used, what kind of food, and how long the food was stored or prepared and cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following answer was written on January 7:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We received your letter, and you are asking us to make a report of how it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, here it is. It was the first day of the year. My mother sent us some soup in an aluminum dinner pail. The time was about 11: 30 a. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I put the pail with the soup out in a little hallway to keep cool, and did not use it till 5: 30 p. m. Then I warmed it for dinner, and the family sat down to eat it. Just as soon as we were through eating, we became ill. We were then taken to the hospital, and I don’t remember anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The vegetables used were fresh. My mother raises her own. The meat that was used was also fresh, having been butchered for New Year. That is all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, dear reader, the story has been told here as in hundreds of other cases which we investigate. Last week extensive group poisoning was reported in Overbrook Hospital of Cedar Grove, N. J., where more than 200 were severely affected by food contamination. A large number were poisoned at the Hall where the law students live, at the University of Michigan. One hundred nineteen students were taken to hospitals recently, at Purdue University, all of whom recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our people will put up ■with this kind of condition until our authorities act for the benefit of all. A strenuous effort is being made by the aluminum interests to maintain their sales of aluminum culinary ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In December, 1931, a series of articles was begun in a national magazine attempting to prove that aluminum kitchenware is harmless. The wrath of the American public will be brought down upon the heads of such persons, in due time, because it is evident that they know and are familiar with the physiological effects of aluminum compounds produced by their wares.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">swald Garrison Villard, editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font6"> says that if he were dictator of America he would muster out the fleet, reduce the army to 25,000 men, send all the generals and admirals to Guam, abolish all tariffs, boycott Japan, recognize Russia, put all lawless officials on prison farms, and transfer Mr. Hoover and his cabinet to the island of Yap. He thinks these steps would restore sanity to America; and they might help, at that.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>Another Rooster Heard From</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford frequently refers to the dominies as ‘‘roosters’’, and it seems a particularly good sobriquet. Their usefulness is about on a par. The loud voice, the strut, the quarrelsomeness, the special headgear, the fine feathers and the empty head all fit nicely into the likeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In writing to Timothy the apostle said of the dominies that they “lead captive silly women”; and doesn't a rooster do that? And then the Revelator speaks of Babylon as a henhouse of unclean birds, and he must have meant that if we looked around a little we should find one of them was a rooster, one for each pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is further evidence that the word seems to fit the mental likeness. When the ladies of the Reformed Church at Marion wanted to advertise their bargain in noodles and apple sauce they inserted a picture of a rooster as a matter of course; so here he is, showing off. And if you study the picture closely you can see that he looks very big and very beautiful and, by comparison, the world down in the corner looks very small and insignificant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It all depends on the eyes with which one looks at a dominie, whether he is very big and important or whether he is just what he usually is, and that is so small we would not attempt to describe it. To the ladies, the boss of the barn</span></p>
<div>

The various conferences, whose objectives have been the establishment of some permanent arrangement whereby peace may be assured, have all come to naught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the London Naval Conference, which was also a failure, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Current Affairs,</span><span class="font6"> a monthly magazine of gratifying brevity, had this to say on the subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The London Naval Conference was a “dud”. The hopes of the peace-loving people of the world for a radical reduction in naval armament and the creation of a temperate atmosphere of peace throughout the nations—these hopes have been wrecked. All the high words pronounced by the delegates and all the purple rhetoric uttered by the politicians are only a smoko screen. One is reminded of the dispatch which the Russian general, Brusiloff, sent to the czar when he was being routed from the Masurian swamps by Hindenburg’s army: “We advance—backwards.” The conflicting patriotisms of the various nations which were members of the conference wrecked everything. Patriotism is rooted in fear; and fear is a primal instinct difficult to overcome. England fears that by reducing her navy her food supply may be cut off and her population starved in a week. France is afraid of everything on all sides. Italy is afraid of France. Japan is afraid of the white man’s prejudice against “the yellow peril”, and we, ourselves, are afraid of the slightest infringement upon our Americanism. Thus crash the hopes of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many other magazines and periodicals echo the sentiment of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Current Affairs.</span><span class="font6"> That effort in the direction of world peace, like the preceding ones and those which have since taken place, has been an entire flop. They can scarcely be called a gesture, and few people are any more deceived by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But have the world’s hopes indeed crashed ? Is the proposition hopeless ? Is there no certain prospect for world peace? To these questions we answer, It depends upon from which quarter peace is expected. Certainly the various nations which have so far ostensibly made efforts to further the. object of peace have demonstrated that this was not indeed their first concern. Selfishness, greed and hatred were the predominating spirit. Each one was desirous of peace based upon his own particular terms, with little or no consideration for others. It must be increasingly apparent that no human agency can bring about peace. What seems to be the difficulty? The greatest obstacle is in human nature itself, as it is at present constituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures establish that the whole world lies in the wicked one; that Satan, the adversary, is the god of this world and that he is blinding the minds or the reasoning faculties of the people so that the purposes of God may not be understood by them. Consequently, the reasoning of all the nations and people is based upon selfishness, a desire to take advantage of everything to advance their own particular interests, and, as a consequence, distrust and fear of one another is in evidence to all. There are altogether too many people in the. world who are still willing to take advantage of others for their own profit; and where that is true, certainly no fault can be found V’ith nations or people who do the same thing to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The. Lord described the condition in the earth today in these words: ‘There is no peace to the wicked.<sup>5</sup> Those who ignore the most fundamental laws of righteousness are wicked, and such cannot, by any manner of means, expect peace, for they do not know the way of peace. Jesus laid down the fundamental principle which would always result in peace, in these words: ‘Bo unto others as you would that they should do unto you.<sup>5</sup> That seems simple enough, easily applied, but this rule cannot be even appreciated by the wrongly disposed, much less practiced by them. It presupposes a foundation of righteousness which would not expect unreasonable things of others but with clear-sighted justice sees the necessity of dealing fairly and generously with one another. To this end the. Bible counsels, “Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.<sup>55</sup> Peace between nation and nation is impossible as long as dominant warlike elements exist within the nations themselves which deliberately and willingly foment strife and have no concern whatever for the welfare of others. There is here a very great difficulty which is perhaps better appreciated by the leaders than by people in general. The lust for supremacy, power and wealth is so great in this class, and their power and influence over the political and financial phases of their own na-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tion are so impelling, that they can usually have what they want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Idealists may call for peace and for the disarming of the nations, but it must be immediately apparent that as long as there is even one nation that is dominated by those who believe in resorting to force, for reasons which they may deem adequate, as long as there is a single nation that refuses to sincerely and completely disarm, there can be no world peace; for the peace-loving nations, if there were any of such, would have no assurance that they would not sooner or later become the victims of the warlike nations. History is replete with records of instances where peacefully disposed people who were quite content to go about their own peaceful ways were attacked by others not at all peacefully disposed, and thus they were obliged either to resort to arms themselves or become the servants of their foes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus is manifested the hopelessness of human efforts to bring world peace. No individual or human agency has sufficient power or authority to force all nations into a condition where peace would be assured to all. Nor is it altogether a question of nation preying upon nation or people upon people. Within the nations themselves there is a conflict between groups and classes which, although it is carried on in a less spectacular manner than by armed combat, is nevertheless essentially the same in its ultimate effect upon the victor and the vanquished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today every large city in the United States has innumerable groups of racketeers which take advantage of the people in general and by every conceivable lawless means prey upon the people. The less fortunately situated are oppressed by the more powerful and better endowed. Thus, life seems to present but one aspect, the aspect of continual conflict in every sphere of human activity. And this is in no sense exaggerated; it is actually the case. This conflict is a much more momentous issue than appears to most people. It boils itself down to a conflict between the forces of righteousness and the forces of evil, a struggle which seems to have, and actually has, continued for ages, and which, in this our day, has reached a magnitude never before attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are approaching the climax of this issue. It is not a question of France against Germany or England against some other nation, nor is it simply a conflict between the yellow and the white race or the black and the white. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font6"> of these animosities are but side issues in the great struggle between truth and righteousness on one hand and falsehood and evil on the other. More than that, it is a conflict between God and the opponent of God, Satan the Devil. Although the Bible is very explicit in its statements of the activity of Satan and his organization, yet a great many people do not believe in the existence of Satan as a powerful spirit creature, or that he has a powerful organization deliberately planning to keep the people away from God and His benevolent purposes for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This problem of world peace is something that is entirely beyond the ability of any human agency to accomplish. It is an issue that must be considered, not from an earthly standpoint, but from a heavenly viewpoint. Realizing that human resources are entirely inadequate to meet the necessities of the situation, as must be apparent to every thinking man and woman, we should turn our minds to some superhuman agency for the deliverance of the world or else be reconciled to continue indefinitely in this condition of misery and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In turning our minds to some superhuman agency for deliverance, the question naturally arises, To whom should we turn ? Whence shall come our hope? There should not be any doubt in the minds of those who claim to be Christians, in this respect. Nineteen hundred years ago Jehovah God gave assurance that it was His ultimate purpose to establish peace on earth, good will among men, and glory to God in the highest, as a result of the work He would perform through Him who was then the babe of Bethlehem. Jesus assures us, in the model prayer which He left for His disciples, that God’s will shall be done on earth as in heaven; that that will will be perfect and acceptable and that it shall be the desire of every living creature. With these assurances given by the Lord, each one should now reverently turn to His Word for a serious consideration of what He has to offer in respect to world peace. The theories of men should be laid aside, whether those men claim to be representatives of God or not. If their statements are not in harmony with His Word, they are valueless. Through the prophet of old Jehovah laid down the rule: “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no [truth] in them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until the people commence to realize this and turn to the Lord, they must and will flounder about and be the prey of scheming and unscrupulous men and systems. We may safely assume that the majority of the people, though imperfect and sinful, are not in harmony with or content with their present condition. They are longing for something better, and they realize that there must be changes everywhere, not only in themselves, but in the affairs of men and nations. No schedule for the. conversion of the world by evangelistic efforts will meet the requirements. All these efforts have proved to be not only painfully slow but pitifully fruitless. Humanity has tried every scheme, not once, but repeatedly, and in many different ways, and every one has left them disillusioned and disappointed, yet forever turning again to some human leader or scheme for fresh disappointment; and unless the Lord comes to the rescue it seems as though this would go on indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time is approaching, however, when the Lord assures us through the prophet, in these words: “Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: [and] . . . then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time is approaching, and that in the near future, when Jehovah God will wipe out the condition of selfishness, greed and oppression, the time when the efforts of puny men, who with fatuous selfishness seek to establish for themselves a kingdom of righteousness, will end in a debacle so tremendous that they will at last be driven to a full realization of their folly. Jehovah will manifest that He alone is God and that only as He is recognized will the longed for goal of peace be attained. There is no other power that can accomplish this for the human family. The Lord through His Word says that those who come to Jehovah will receive His blessing and peace, in these words: “The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.”—Isa. 32:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can be no peace without righteousness, and there can be no righteousness without God. The certain prospect for world peace, therefore, lies in God’s assurance that He has purposed it and that He, too, has purposed the means by which it shall be brought about, and that means is the kingdom of His Son, Christ Jesus, who as God’s representative will rule the earth in righteousness and establish judgment and justice henceforth even forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only a government having divine authority, and exercising that authority without interference for the benefit of man, can bring “peace on earth”. And it is just such a government that God has purposed. For He has put all things under Christ’s feet, and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be. Then shall the nations dwell together in amity and peace, and no longer shall nation lift up sword against nation. But they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks. The paraphernalia of war will be transmuted into the equipment of peace. The very thought of war will be repugnant to the people then, for they shall not learn war any more. There is divine comfort in these words. Now the nations are bending every effort to perfect themselves in the art of war and to train ever increasing forces of war. But then they shall learn war no more. The time and effort, the wealth and material, wasted in the present insane programs of preparedness, will then be turned to better use, and the nations be immeasurably benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the peace that God’s Word envisages means more, much more, than mere cessation of hostilities between nations. That is only one aspect of the matter, though an important one. The animosities that now stir the breasts of men, the dislike for the foreign, the strange, or for that which is not familiar, will give place to a broad tolerance; for love will, more and more, take the place of unreasoning hatreds, and helpfulness and kindness will replace envy and jealousy. Does this seem too much to expect? Does not God’s Word assure us that ‘he will take away the stony heart and give them hearts of flesh’? God says, “I will . . . reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.”—Jer. 33:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But someone will perhaps object that what I have quoted consists only of fragmentary selections from the Old Testament prophecies which have no direct bearing upon the situation. However, remember that what things were written aforetime do have a very special application for us upon whom the ends of the age are come. Also call to mind the words of Peter, who said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:19-21) Again, someone may say that the times of reconstruction apply only to the nation of Israel, and not to other nations. Let such remember that the Lord tells us through His prophet that the nations shall go up to the house of the Lord, “to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Mie. 4:2, 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the judgments of the Lord arc in the earth the inhabitants of the world shall learn righteousness. And, learning righteousness, they shall have the effect and result of righteousness, which is peace, quietness and assurance forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">M hat has been said is only a very small part of the abundant testimony in God’s Word on the subject of world peace. As already stated, all the prophets bear witness to its coming. And not only they, hut Jesus Christ, the faithful and true witness himself, confirms the assurance that there is a certain prospect for world peace which shall not fail of accomplishment, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</span></p>

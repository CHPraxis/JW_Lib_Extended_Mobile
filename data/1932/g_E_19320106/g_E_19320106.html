<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XIII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N. Y., Wednesday, January 6, 1932 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 321</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Exploration Reduced to a Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T7HFTY years ago an explorer was an individual. He went out at his own expense, expecting adventure, and received it, and brought back what he pleased to receptive, uncritical scientists. Today exploration is a business in which numbers of young scientists have their expenses paid for them by a university, a national museum, a learned society, or a government, and look upon adventures as the result of bad planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today for the first time in history it is possible for an explorer to make a business of exploration and to make money out of it. All publicity agencies are bent on making explorers famous and pay them real money as well. The news rights of any good story today are worth a fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fully equipped scientific exploration expedition costs from $50,000 to $500,000. An explorer calls attention to the fact that such an expedition must consider problems of equipment, radio, press and magazine stories, syndicated features or articles, personnel, and legal items, and to these details must be added the basic one of facing death in the wilderness, and the collection and preservation of scientific specimens under the most perilous circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Exploring involves the hardest kind of physical exertion and the capacity to endure such exertion under stress, both for long periods of sustained endeavor and in the trying moments of emergency. It frequently happens that the explorer’s search for facts about the unknown may result in a race with time against starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are people who have the wanderlust and the desire to explore born in them. There were recently in New York two children, a boy three and a girl four years old, who at that time had already been in forty-three countries, on four continents. At the time they passed through New York with their parents they had never been ill a day and had never stayed so long as a month in any one place. These little folks can travel by themselves and can prepare food for themselves. They are familiar with camel meat, shark meat and buffalo milk. At the time they passed through New York they were on their way as part of an expedition to the South Sea Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A German woman, the daughter of a Berlin engineer, while yet a child participated in an exploration expedition to Africa, and although she is now married and has a family she still feels that she must go again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time expeditions are in preparation to visit a dozen or more little-known corners of the world. There is no trouble finding people who would be glad to go along. The trouble is in picking out the right ones to take and the right ones to leave at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The use of the airplane and the dirigible has changed the entire business of exploration, and it is bound to continue until the remotest sections of the earth are surveyed and charted and until no land longer remains veiled in mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So recently as the year 1800 western and northern Canada were unknown; the western part of the United States was unexplored; almost nothing was known of South America; Japan was still a closed land; Australia (then called New Holland) had but 2,000 inhabitants who knew nothing of the country back from the coast; little was known of the northern and central parts of Asia; and so little was known about Africa that it could well be called the “Dark Continent” in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is, of course, no need for anybody to go on tours of exploration to Europe, and yet something is always coming to light in even the oldest settled countries. Thus, it was not until the summer of 1931 that it was discovered that there is a geyser in Switzerland. This geyser erupts regularly every fifteen minutes, shooting a stream of water thirty feet into the air. There it has been working away faithfully in that little</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">country for thousands of years completely hidden away from the eyes of man until recently. One would have supposed such a thing quite impossible.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Discoveries in North America</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Very little is known of Greenland, and much of northern Canada and Alaska yet remains to be photographed from the air; but this work is being rapidly done, and it will not be long before it is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the airplane photography of Canada and Alaska there is practically no danger of a man’s being lost in the bush or starving, as the planes are always sent out in pairs. The different bases know each day where every plane is operating and where every man may be picked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems hard to realize that nothing was known of the Yellowstone National Park until after the Civil War; yet such is the truth. On September 14,1867, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Montana Post</span><span class="font4"> contained the following announcement of the discovery of a region some knowledge of which is now in almost every home in the land:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An exploring party, which has been to the headwaters of the Yellowstone river, has just returned and reports seeing one of the greatest wonders of the world. For eight days they traveled through a volcanic country, emitting blue flame and living streams of molten brimstone. The hollow ground resounded beneath their feet as they traveled, and every movement seemed to break through. Not a living thing was seen in the vicinity. The explorers gave it the significant appellation of “hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we were to think of exploration of North America we should think of it as it appears to the uncivilized natives of other lands. Two Uganda boys were brought over from Central Africa by Martin Johnson to care for three gorillas and two young chimpanzees. When they saw the auto traffic on Fifth Avenue, their opinion was that all these people must be crazy. They were familiar with autos, having seen something of them in Africa; they could not understand how the colored people of Harlem could be rich enough to own their own autos. In Uganda, black boys earn $4.00 a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two African boys were soon adopted by the Harlemites, several hundred of whom paid 50c apiece to hear the language of their ancestors. Each time the Uganda boy lectured he received a crisp one dollar note and a pair of knickerbockers. In all, he lectured eight times and got $8.00 and eight pairs of knickerbockers. His manager cleared several thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When these Uganda boys first came to New York they had a wonderful time playing with the electric lights, turning them on and off as fast as they could, but within three weeks’ time they wanted $5.00 a day for an eight-hour day, wanted to sleep in a big hotel down town, wanted an auto to ride in, and all the ice cream they could eat, and wanted plenty of bright clothes and shiny shoes. When these lads return to Central Africa it is going to be hard to get back to the conditions under which they live there, but they will have something to talk about for the rest of their lives. They have been explorers in a foreign land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is some exploratory work yet to be done in parts of Mexico and Central America. It is said that in the island of Dominica, in the West Indies, although the island is only thirty miles long and sixteen miles wide, there are birds and other forms of life which have not been found elsewhere. A moth with a wing spread of nine inches was recently brought back by an expedition to Honduras.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Exploration in South America</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">As late as 1850 very little was known about South America, and there still is a great deal of the continent that remains unexplored. In 1850 Dutch Guiana was called Surinam, and the northwest corner of the continent was Terra Firma or Castile del Oro. In that period the South American Chimborazo, 20,000 feet high, was thought to be higher than any other mountain in the world. At that time there were stories of Amazonian women, of Indians with heads under their arms, and of cities of gold; but none of these have ever been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many difficulties in the way of South American exploration: Boa constrictors able to kill an ox as readily as man; ants that can destroy life of any kind that comes within their reach; malignant malaria which kills within a few hours, and natives who are afraid of white men with their rifles and drive them back with poisoned arrows. In the jungles of Brazil there is a ferocious fish, the river piraya, which attacks men and beasts, if by accident they are thrown into the water. A shoal of pirayas has been known to attack and consume a full-sized ox in twenty-five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One group of scientists made six separate attempts to locate the source of the Orinoco river in Venezuela and finally succeeded. Dr. Herbert Spencer Dickey, who directed each of these expeditions, states that his last trip was the hardest journey ever made in more than thirty years of experience of tropical rivers and jungle trails, and that the worst part of it was the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">South American explorers are urged to carry the lightest luggage possible for travel and scientific w’ork, very light but strong tents, folding canoes of canvas, light sporting rifles, dependable flashlights, folding camp beds, finely woven mosquito nets, flannel shirts, woolen socks, cavalry boots, and loose-fitting clothes made of khaki. The food supplies recommended are compressed tablets of strong concentration and of as many varieties as it is possible to obtain. Candy, hard bread, tea and coffee are also recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Explorers in Brazil say that the greatest care must be exercised in the selection of carriers, canoemen and muleteers. Mistakes in the choosing of these men often result in the failure of an expedition through the ‘camaradas’ ’ abandoning their job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five-sevenths of the world is yet unmapped, and probably there is at least this proportion of South America yet to be visited and charted. It has only recently been discovered that the headwaters of the Amazon are linked with the headwaters of the Plata river. This discovery confirms a long-standing hypothesis of geographers who have noted the identical fishes and animals in both rivers and river basins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than 2,000 miles off the Chilean coast lies one of the most curious pieces of real estate in the world, Easter Island, one of the most isolated inhabited spots on the earth, and one of the least accessible. Only a few explorers have ever visited this place, a fragment of volcanic land of 45 square miles in area. This island contains 260 enormous tombs, some of them 300 feet long and 15 feet high, topped by terraces that in some cases measure 100 feet in width. Face down, more than 600 colossal stone busts lie scattered on the island. These colossal tombs and overturned statues suggest to our mind the work of demons, perhaps dating from before the flood and possibly overthrown! at the time of the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Far to the north of Easter Island, but nearer the South American shore, are the Galapagos Islands, where are to be found giant turtles and other forms of life not found elsewhere on the globe. It is said that the going on the Galapagos is the worst in the world. There is vegetation everywhere except on the later lava flows, but it is all rooted amid rocks and boulders and ridges, and the thorn bush is dominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A German scientist and his wife, the last We knew, had been living on one of the Galapagos Islands for about a year. The ship which left the couple promised to return and get them in five months, but never came back.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Exploration in Asia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">An explorer who has returned from Siberia tells of some of the peculiar problems one is unexpectedly called upon to solve. Suppose in your travels you happen to meet a large, shaggy bear, one able to make away with a dozen men as well as one. There are just two things you can do. You can either shoot to kill him or you can peel off all your clothes and start to dance; and the better you dance the safer you are. The bear becomes puzzled by the sudden disappearance of the dark clothes and the equally sudden appearance of a white figure, all arms and whirling legs, and beats a hasty retreat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This explorer was interested in the strange life of the tundra frog. From September to June, if one picks up one of these frogs and drops him on a hard surface he breaks into' bits as though he were made of China; yet during July and August he lives the happy life of any normal frog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every summer the birds sweep into Siberia in great profusion; but they stay only a few weeks. By the end of July they gather for their southward flight, and on their way south frequently break down the telegraph wires by perching upon them in such great numbers that the wires are unable to bear the load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have recently been several expeditions into the interior of China. On one of these the party ran out of sugar, but finally found some traders who had some. Roy Andrews, the explorer, said of this sugar incident: “We were willing to pay any price for it. Then it was divided up into little mounds and each man drew lots so that no one would get a larger mound except by luck. Each one was allowed to eat his sugar as he pleased. He could gobble it all at once or save it and eat it little by little. One of the party thought to save the delicious flavor by mixing it with water, and the water drew every kind of bug in China and Siberia to his party. However, it was too good to waste; so he just closed his eyes while he drank?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On a more recent trip to the interior of China, Mr. Andrews and his friends found it difficult to get their specimens out of the country. Their work was interrupted by a Chinese organization, The Society for the Preservation of Cultural Objects. No one can blame the Chinese for wanting to keep in their country the relics of by-gone ages which are to be found there. No country desires to have its antiquities carted off to other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recent explorers in China express surprise at frequently finding cities of 15,000 or more population where no white man has ever been seen. Many of these cities have no roads or trails where a horse could walk; all their supplies are brought in on the backs of coolies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year 1931 Bertram Thomas, newspaper man, surprised the world by crossing the Arabian Desert, a land one and one-half times as large as France, and particularly difficult to enter or to travel through because mountains rim it in on the east and south, and deserts on the north and west. Moreover, all around the outer rim of the desert area are tribes that are independent of control, that guard their few wells and water holes jealously and look upon travelers from the outside world as meddlesome and trespassers meriting death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time Mr. Thomas crossed this desert it was believed by the natives to be the home of spirits; and that part of their belief is correct. Its drifting sands were also supposed to hide the ruins of old cities; and some such ruins were found. They also held the belief that there were oases in the interior where strange tribes lived and great quicksands would swallow up the unwary traveler. But Mr. Thomas found neither the oases nor the strange tribes, nor the quicksands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Field Museum Syrian Desert Expedition, of Chicago, believes that it has found in Alt. Horeb the rock which supplied the thirsty Israelites with water. They said that a steady creek of cool liquid flows from the rock and forms the Wady Musa, or Stream of Moses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Exploration in Africa</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1800, except for a small settlement at Cape Town and the Nile valley, the whole interior of Africa was unknown. As late as 1850 maps showed mountain ranges extending across Africa where the Congo Basin actually lies. Most of Africa was explored within the memory of men now living. The great explorer Henry M. Stanley has been dead twenty-seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A New York woman, Airs. Delia J. Akeley, has spent months at a time living in the Belgian Congo among the pigmy tribes that so interested Mr. Stanley. Airs. Akeley says that a good pigmy wife can be obtained for a good sharp knife, while others not so comely may be bought for salt or other trifles. Cannibalism is still practiced, and friends of those who have recently died sleep on their graves so that their neighbors will not dig them up and eat them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Airs. Akeley says that the pigmies are a very clean race and bathe regularly. They are very fond of salt, toy balloons, tobacco and soap. She says that in any village these little people are the size of normal ten-year-old children. They are difficult to locate, and disappear quickly if an intruder approaches. Their language comprises hardly more than 300 words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The big game that made exploration in Africa so dangerous even twenty-five years ago is rapidly passing away. The elephant herds are being reduced in numbers, and it seems that most of the largest elephants have been already slain. It takes the fun out of being an elephant when they come after you with a high-powered truck and a big gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Elephant hunters say that ten years ago 100-pound tusks could be obtained. Five years ago a hunter was fortunate to get an 80-pound tusk. Today he is glad to get a 50-pound tusk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although an elephant cannot see clearly more than 75 feet away, his senses of hearing and smell are so acute that he can locate impending danger at a distance upward of 300 feet. An astonishing thing about elephants is that they can go through the densest foliage and undergrowth without making the slightest sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not now believed that elephants live to be hundreds of years of age as was formerly thought to be the case. Their age is evidently about that of man, and when an elephant gets to be eighty or ninety years old he has about reached his span.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A traveler tells of how the blacks in Africa use the demons to help them in their hunting expeditions. He says: “While I was on this spear-hunting safari we followed several herds into waterless country in the Bahr-el-Ghazai district of the Sudan, where the elephants usually trek to water only every third or fourth night. When they do, nothing will stop them. We followed this particular herd all day, and at night I was ready to give up. Imade camp and stopped. Baballa, a young hard-bitten Mandala hunter, who was said to be something of a magician, then came to me and said he thought he could ‘bind’ the herd with his magic rope. These ‘magic ropes’ are not uncommon in Africa. They are usually about a yard long and made of Dompalm fiber. Baballa sat down with the rope in his hands and went through the motions of tying his arms, legs, ankles and neck, muttering incantations as he did so. His muscles became taut, and he relapsed into a semi-trance. He sat so for a few minutes, and then suddenly relaxed, grunted ‘That is good’ and rose to his feet. Next morning we ran into the elephants only half a mile from camp and killed one! They were almost stationary. By all reckonings they should have been miles away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Martin Johnson, famous big game hunter, reports having come at one time upon a group of not less than 25,000 crocodiles, some 35 feet in length, massed one on top of another along a river bank and extending for over a mile. They had congregated at this spot to eat fish, which were here in great profusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Johnson was pleased to find at Miami the identical flow’ers and fruits which were raised on his farm at Paradise Lake in the heart of Africa. He thinks the world is becoming less beautiful because the works of man so mar the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Johnson warns against walking far from camp at night in the lion country without a gun and a powerful flashlight. Lions always growl before attacking. An experienced hunter upon hearing the growl can spot the lion with his light at a distance of 300 or 400 feet. The lion is halted by the sudden glare and the hunter has a chance to shoot. Many have been mauled to death through failure to heed this advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An African explorer told of having seen eleven persons within a period of six weeks who had been maimed by leopards. The leopard is considered one of the most dangerous animals in the African jungle because of his marvelous body, his intelligence and his courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Explorers in Africa have to go prepared to withstand great changes of temperature. In the desert regions in the daytime the temperature is 100°F., while at night it drops below the freezing point. One explorer states that he suffered more from cold than from heat while traveling over high elevations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not so hard as you may think to keep the path across the trackless desert. The markers along the way are the skeletons of the camels that have had to give up the fight. Sometimes there are more than 200 skeletons to the mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The airplane and the auto are being greatly used in the exploration of Africa. Strange as it may seem, Africa has been crossed at least twice, once from west to east and once from east to west, in auto trucks. The trip each time took about a year. One would think that the load must have consisted principally of gasoline, and the supply would have to be renewed every time a trade route was crossed. The survey of Rhodesia by airplane has just been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some explorers give their attention almost entirely to obtaining specimens of the animals peculiar to the country or locality visited. One expedition which went to South Africa brought back a herd of sable antelope to Philadelphia. When the antelope w’ere brought back, bits of landscape were also dismounted and packed up with infinite attention to detail. Leaves of trees and bushes were carefully stripped off and packed. Acacia trees were felled, sawed into sections, which were numbered, and the parts were shipped to be reconstructed later. The bush on which the sable feeds was uprooted and, with other native plants and flowers, packed in excelsior. Grass and stone and even some of the soil itself were taken, so that the sable antelope’s background in its Philadelphia setting might be absolutely truthful. Photographs and sketches which include tropical sky and cloud effects, will be of help in reassembling this bit of Africa in America.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Exploration in Australasia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Besides exploring in Africa, the Martin Johnsons have been in the South Sea Islands among the head hunters and cannibals. The New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> tells us of one of their experiences. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They found the real cannibals on the island of Male-kula, and they came near to being eaten by them in one of the feasts they had come to picture. The Johnsons had already seen the rites of the cannibals under the chief Nagapate. They saw the head-hunters going about their careful and intricate art of smoking and preserving their grisly trophies. Then Nagapate decided to detain them. When they resisted, he had them captured in the darkness. The Johnsons were separated. What would have happened next if Nagapate’s intentions had been carried out was not revealed, because just as the savages had got their captives to the ceremonial ring at the top of a hill, one of the things that can believably happen only in melodrama occurred. Far below the hill, but in plain sight of the cannibals and the Johnsons on the hill, the British patrol boat Euphrosyne, on its regular tour of inspection, steamed into the harbor and lowered a boat. The savages thought it had come to the rescue. The Johnsons encouraged the idea. Nagapate’s men were confused. They allowed the Johnsons to start down the hill. When they were half way down they saw the Euphrosyne starting to put to sea again. The savages saw that, too. Then they heard the conch-shell signals of the savages who were trying to intercept them. But by running at full speed through the cane that tore their faces the Johnsons managed to get to their own boat in time to beat the cannibals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are pigmies in the heart of New Guinea, as in the heart of Central Africa. These pigmies trembled in awe when a match was struck and when a reading lens was used to bring the sun’s rays into a heap of dried leaves; but the little brown pigmies did something the full-sized white man could not do. They sawed fire out of a piece of wood with a strip of flexible bamboo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout that part of the world fire is also made with a popgun, technically called a “fire syringe”. This instrument consists of a wooden tube, with a short plunger fitting tightly in the bore of the gun, and a wad of tinder packed in the lower end of the tube. To produce fire the native draws the plunger out and then drives it home smartly. The heat produced by the compression of the air ignites the tinder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are still some cannibals in Australia. Sir Hubert Wilkins gained the confidence of some of these. Some of their rules were that only young men may eat babies; the flesh of young girls is eaten only by the old men of the tribe; women are not allowed to eat young boys; but anybody may eat grown-up men or women. This cannibalism persists among those who have some vague knowledge of “Christianity”. Sir Hubert Wilkins told of a wife stealer who was put to death and then eaten. The reason given was: “Now that he is dead and his spirit gone to Jesus, it is not likely it will return to harm us; so why should we waste such fine, fat meat?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 1930 there was an exploration into Dutch Borneo. Head-hunting is forbidden by the colonial government; but the Dyaks believe their departed kin will need slaves in the abode of death, so they do not think it out of order to decapitate a servant. Heads are considered valuable, too, to ward off sickness, famine and disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The explorers in Borneo found the humidity in the jungle very great. This made photography difficult, and the ordinary tasks of travel were trying. They were often troubled by leeches, which seemed to be everywhere. These found a way of getting through the eyelets of shoes, and it was not unusual at night to find a dozen or more of them bunched together like a ball of snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one place the expedition was in a huge morass for two days. The first night they had to remain standing, as there was no dry spot available to make camp. Often the men sank to their knees and over their heads in water and there was constant danger from crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assaults upon the Antarctic continent continue, but work there is done only at tremendous risks, often accompanied by great physical suffering. Nevertheless the Byrd Expedition has shown how the land may be mapped, and without a doubt the work will be done in due time.</span></p>

His party was without food; they had to have it; the only place to get it was in a cannibal village, a completely enclosed place of twenty houses, arranged side by side around an oval space in the interior. Against the advice of his native guides Doctor Crandall climbed the tall three-barred entrance barrier and descended inside the village. Gifts broke the ice and won food and friendship. “Give and it shall be given you, good measure, pressed down, heaped together and running over shall men give into your bosom.”</span></p>

In the new book, which is by G. Stanley Russell, the doctrine of the Ransom, one of the most important doctrines of the Christian, is completely repudiated in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Great War in which, by the huge crucifixion of Christ in a myriad lives for and by sin, the world has been shamed and raised into new and loftier thought and action, into a most determined effort to renounce the barbarism of war and erect the foundations of civilization on peace, into a fresh sense of its unity with God and itself, is part of Christ’s atoning work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So the Great War is a part of Christ’s atoning •work, is it ? And Sherman said that “war is hell”; and the real fighters all say that it is. Rev. Dr. G. S. Russell should not write any more books.</span></p>

Another federal agent, at Santa Monica, California, ran into President Hoover’s brother-in-law just at an embarrassing moment, when he happened to have in his possession a gunnysack containing nineteen pints of liquor. But instead of fracturing his skull he advised him to protect himself and the president by giving a false name. Why be so unjust? It tends to undermine all respect for law.</span></p>

This shows exactly what to do with Rev. Andrew Caraker at the outbreak of hostilities. Give him a gas mask and head him for the front line trenches. Merely as a matter of information we remind Reverend Caraker that when greenhorns first put on gas masks they sometimes vomit in them, but do not dare take them off, as it means death. But we do not feel that such involuntary ejection of bile from Reverend Caraker’s system would do him any harm, and hence we are strong for him to have first chance.

<p><span class="font4">VER since the World War the so-called great financiers of the world have tried to get all the principal nations away from paper money and over to the gold standard. They got what they wanted. This made everybody want gold; and the strongest got it, the same being Uncle Sam and La Belle France. But as soon as they got the gold standard in general use England found she could not maintain it and had to go back to paper. Then the same great financiers said that was a good thing. The fact of the business is that anything that will enable them to hang on to their pile just a little longer is in their eyes ‘a good thing’. If England were swallowed up in a financial collapse it would draw down these prognosticators of America along with the rest. The more paper money there is issued, the worse it is for the creditor class. It is to their interest that there be as little real money as possible. That is why they prefer the gold standard and dear money.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>What the World Might Be</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N THE magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty</span><span class="font4"> H. G. Wells tells what the world might be. He says: “All the necessities of the human population, food, abundant transport, clean, fresh, and beautiful housing and furniture, adequate health services, education, social security, could be supplied now under modern conditions by something between twelve and twenty years of not too arduous work on the part of everyone. The town, the countryside, would be undergoing constant revision and improvement: the world city would be constantly more gracious and pleasant; the world garden, constantly more beautiful. The layout of industry could be as exciting as a game.” And then Mr. Wells tells us why we do not have these happy times now, and everybody knows he tells the plain truth when he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is no good mincing matters when it comes to saying why we have not this universal well-being at the present time. Most of our rulers and directors are, to put it plainly, narrow-minded, self-centered, mentally indolent, pompous and pretentious creatures of the past; and we others are fools enough to tolerate their mismanagement. These ruling and controlling people have got enough for themselves, they stick to the controls like barnacles, they live in relative comfort and immense dignity, chiefly engaged in the defense of their own conceit, and the mass of us lack the spirit, will, and understanding to call them to account. A thousand million human creatures are leading lives of want, humiliation, limitation, and toil; scores of millions are in immediate danger of the futile tortures of war, and these dull, self-protective folk in control of things do nothing of what they might do and pose for our respect and admiration with infinite self-complacency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Education Compulsory; School Attendance Not </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Judge Henry Neil, publicist, of East Aurora,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">N. Y., dropped in to see us the other day, and let fall the interesting bit of information that while education is compulsory in the United States, yet school attendance is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He went on to say that the United States Supreme Court had settled this matter in the Oregon case, having decided that the parent must see to it, either by giving the instruction himself or arranging to have it given by others, that the child shall not grow to maturity without ability to read and write. It is proper for the state to provide education for its future citizens, but if a parent provides for that education otherwise, then he is not obligated to accept the state’s provision. That seems to settle the education end of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps this information will be of value to the anxious parent in Ohio who wrote us the following letter recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About July 20, 1931, Dr. Baldridge, county health doctor of Butler county, Ohio, vaccinated the daughter (age 5) of Mrs. Roof of No. 10 Howman Avenue, New Miami, Ohio (about 4 miles from Hamilton). The little girl was in perfect health when vaccinated, but never got well afterwards. Dr. Harry Deubel, No. 230 Dayton St., Hamilton, was their physician. The girl was taken to the hospital, where she was doctored ten days. Her parents were not informed as to what was her disease, until, on the death certificate it was pronounced “Vaccine Encephalitis”. (It was because of frequent cases of Vaccine Encephalitis that Holland recently abandoned compulsory vaccination.) The Mr. Roof has two other children not expected to live, from same disease. Hamilton has ordinance compelling all school children to be vaccinated before attending school this fall. I have two children to go to school and I intend to resist this ordinance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>A Surprising Lesson in Dented Ethics</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE man who claims to have the largest dental business in the world (he has 35 offices in the United States) seems not to think highly of dental ethics, or medical ethics in general. In a book narrating his own experiences he makes this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The object has been the same in each case: to keep the common herd out of the professional pasture; to perpetuate a system which will keep knowledge, necessary to the well-being of the human race, in the hands of the few for the profit of the few; and to make the multitude believe that it can never aspire to any such heights of wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Narrating the efforts which were made by the ethieal to discipline him for giving dental lectures on the streets, for advertising, for cutting prices, and for doing other things displeasing to his professional brethren, he sets forth the following surprising statement of what some dentists once considered ethical treatment of the public at the time they were laboring to convert an erring colleague from the error of his ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They would send a patient to me and, after I had extracted his teeth, they would take him in hand, and, under pretense of “rectifying” my “blunders”, they would put arsenical paste or fibre, saturated with carbolic acid, into the tooth socket, and let nature take its course. When the inevitable trouble followed, they would tell this unfortunate that I had given him bloodpoisoning; he would have to go to the hospital, and he should certainly file suit for damages against me. One peculiarly vicious ease I recall was that of a Fourth avenue barber, into whose tooth socket one of the “ethical” dentists placed arsenical fibre after I had treated him. When I saw him later, he had a hole in the side of his face into which I could stick my fist. Before he died, he visited my family physician and laid before him the whole plot.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>WBBR’S New Organ</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">FpHE other day S. H. Toutjian, organ specialist, showed us some of the interesting things about WBBR’S new organ, a very great addition to the studio. Though the console or keyboard is on the floor of the main studio, yet the works of the organ itself are located on the first and second floors beneath. The sounds come up through gratings in the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The organ has 730 pipes, all sizes and lengths. When one of the pipes is too long to go in the place where it is supposed to go, it is just tied in a knot so as to take up the surplus length. It seems that the sound that emerges from its throat is just the same when the pipe is as crooked as a ram’s horn as it is when it is straight as an arrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First is the open diapason tibia clausa, a very heavy full-toned flute. It takes 73 pipes to carry all the variations of that. Next is the bourdon flute, a softer, lighter flute; this one has 85 pipes. Next comes the viol d’orchestre; it has a cutting violin sound and represents the violin, the viola and the cello; it has 73 pipes. The vio-lone, which is the counterpart of the bass violin, has 12 pipes. The viol celeste is a softer string sound and takes in the cello, viola and violin; it has 73 pipes. The clarinet, heavy and light, eight feet and four feet, has 61 pipes. The kinura, or Turkish oboe, a very sharp, cutting sound, is eight feet and four feet, with 61 pipes. The vox humana imitates male human voices and has 73 pipes. The French trumpet takes in the trombone and cornet and has 73 pipes. The French horn, a very heavy reed sound, has 17 pipes. The harp and harp celeste have 49 notes, and the cathedral chimes have 20. WBBR has the reputation of furnishing the very best high-class music that goes out over the radio from any station in New York. This new organ will add to its ability to give the best.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">AMESTOWN, N. Y., has a minimum bill of only 70c a month for electricity used in the home, or 3y<sub>2</sub>c for the first 50 kilowatt hours. After that the rate is less. That Jamestown can afford to do this is proved by the fact that the municipally owned plant which provides these rates is making money; it recently bought out its privately owned competitor, after the latter had vainly tried by legal methods to force it to charge higher rates. Another reason why the Jamestown plant can afford to charge but 70c for 20 kilowatt hours of electricity is that the cost of those units of electricity at three-tenths of one cent per kilowatt hour would be but 6c, anyway. That leaves 64c to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go on,</span><span class="font4"> and 64c is a big margin on current that costs but 6c at the switchboard. But now see the situation in Scranton, the Electric City. Current can be produced as cheaply there as anywhere under the sun, yet, in the face of these hard times, the Scranton Electric Company first holds up the poor miner with a fiat charge of $1.00 per month as a “Ready to Serve” charge. This is before they give him any current at all. Then if he uses 20 kilowatt hours he is charged another $1.00 for that, making a total of $2.00 for what the Jamestowm householder is able to get for 70c. No bigger rascality was ever practiced under the sun than the imposition of these so-called “Service Charges”, “Ready to Serve Charges,” “Room Charges,” etc., etc., now commonly laid upon the poor all over the country by the infamous Power Trust. Under the pretense of lowering rates they have actually increased them to the poor, while lowering them to the rich. If that is not the spirit of the Devil, name something that is. If the Scranton Electric Company had any shame at all it would stop charging in Scranton three times what the same current costs the householder in Jamestown.</span></p>

It gives us peculiar pleasure to point out that the Citizens’ Medical Reference Bureau of New York is dead set against parents’ being forced to have their children vaccinated unless they wish it done; its face is headed toward medical liberty, and it has just achieved a real triumph in the direction of its efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the fall of the year New York city had another mild epidemic of infantile paralysis. The Citizens’ Medical Reference Bureau, therefore, acting on behalf of the numerous parents that share its sentiments and support its work, requested the board of education to suspend vaccination requirements, owing to the fact that much medical opinion holds it unwise to vaccinate against smallpox while infantile paralysis is prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The board of health thereupon did the right thing. Its general medical expert told the district superintendents to advise principals to excuse children at the first sign of sickness, and added that upon the request of a parent a child need not present a vaccination certificate for admission to the schools this fall until the danger period is over. He also advised against the removal of tonsils and other minor operations during the danger period, on the ground that the lowered resistance of the child might work to its injury if exposed to infantile paralysis infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems to us that the board has done just the right thing; and now if they will make it permanent, and let those who wish to be vaccinated he vaccinated and those remain unvaccinated who do not believe in it, and are willing to run the risk of being unvaccinated, we shall be getting somewhere. So long as the ones who wish to be “protected” are “protected”, why demand that those who do not wish to be “protected” should be “protected” anyway, even if it kills them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be inconsistent for parents who have had their children vaccinated to claim that such children are exposed to danger by coming in contact with those that have not been vaccinated; indeed, the purpose of their vaccination is to remove that very fear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">P</span><span class="font4">ERHAPS the following figures from reports of the United States Treasurer and bureau of statistics may shed some light on at least one fruitful cause of our present business depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1920 incomes of $1,000,000 or more totaled $77,078,139. In 1929 they totaled $1,185,135,330. In 1920 incomes of $5,000 or less totaled $15,274,217,215. In 1929 they totaled $8,282,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus in the last ten years the many skilled workers, small business men and the professional classes, those who usually spend about all their income, keeping the money moving in the channels of trade, have had their incomes cut almost in two, while the super-rich, who were already receiving vastly more than they put back into the channels of trade, now have fifteen times as much income as they had ten years ago, and are obliged to hunt “foreign markets” to loan their “surplus” because the dear people at home have no more gilt-edged security to put up for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our wise statesmen and expert financiers seem somewhat addled, according to all their conflicting pronouncements, regarding the cause of and cure for our distressed condition. Among the numerous causes they assign they would have us believe it is because our granaries and banks are bulging with a “surplus” of commodities and money. Yet we see millions of our people suffering from want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We ween there would be no suffering from hunger among a tribe of monkeys because nature had produced more coconuts than the monkeys could consume. But had they been endowed with as much intelligence as our efficiency experts, and had nature also made all the leaves on the trees dollar bills, most of the poor monkeys would have to go hungry to bed because of an overproduction of food and an inflation of the currency.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font4">N OCTOBER 12 an airplane went up over Sacramento, California, sponsored by the Community Chest of that city, and showered the city with the usual annual appeal for funds. The appeal started off with the following extraordinary statement of the way in which our national leaders, the apostles of Big Business, and their spokesmen, have fulfilled their promises to the boys that went to France, that on their return (if they returned) they should come back to a new world, a world in which every man would love his brother and there would be a square deal for everybody all around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be the time which everybody has been looking for, when the common man would get what is coming to him. Big Business, his big brother, would step aside and let him have his share: not in the neck; oh, no, Big Business would not do that. But read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fourteen years ago our streets were full of marching men—grim, determined men—marching on to the roll of drums and America’s bugled summons to sacrifice. The patriotism of every man, woman, and child in Sacramento was put to the test. Men and women gave of their lives and treasure that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">those inner things</span><span class="font3"> we call “America” might be served. Today the drums are still, and the bugles silent. Yet again our streets are full of men—grim, silent, shuffling men—tramping, searching men—seeking food, shelter, existence for themselves and their families. Again </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">America and those inner things we call “America” are tested.</span><span class="font3"> So give without stint this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well do we remember when that past master of the great American art of windjamming, Woodrow Wilson, let fall from his pen or his lips the statement when the Russians first threw off the yoke of czardom, that “the way in which we now treat the Russian people will be the acid test of our friendship for that great people”, and in no time, because the Russian idea of government is so different from the way we do things in Sacramento, and everywhere else in America, he was one of the first to insist that, in our holiness, we should not recognize the Bolsheviks or have anything to do with them. We were too honest and too pious for that. But now the Russians have plenty of work, and we have little; they are full of hope, and the most we can say for our great and near great statesmen, orators, financiers, militarists and others that have made us what we are is that if they are full of anything it is mostly prunes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Japanese name is that the sun never perishes. The Chinese refer to Korea as Highly Beautiful; the Japanese call it Morning Calm. The Chinese refer to Russia as the Sudden Country, while the Japanese call it the Dew Country, as indicating their thought that when the sun rises the dew perishes. The Chinese refer to the country of Great Britain as the Flourishing Country; the Japanese use the same term, but it signifies that it is a sister country of Japan. The Chinese refer to France as the Law Country, because international law is written in French; the Japanese call it Buddha Country, signifying that it is above the human. The Chinese refer to Germany as the Grace Country, while the Japanese call it Alone Peace, as indicating their great admiration of German militarism. The Chinese call the United States the Beautiful Country, while the Japanese call it the Rice Country, because rice is the staple diet of the Japanese. The aforementioned terms are in common use in Japanese newspapers, textbooks and official letters, and are often on the lips of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As to Home Rule for India </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Arthur Cartwright (Calif.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font4">UCH expression is given throughout the world on the Indian situation and Mahatma Gandhi’s struggle for the freedom of the people of India in home rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As one who has been in India and made a study of her people, religious rituals and Indian administration, I submit a few points to show that India in its present condition is not ready for independence. What the Hindus need is protection against themselves until God’s kingdom is set up in their midst. An educated Hindu may endeavor to gloss over certain parts of this article with explanations, but the statements made cannot be disproved or shaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The religious books of the Hindu are called “sastras” (or “shasters”). They teach that after the destruction of the former world by a deluge, a divinity whose name is Vishnu composed himself to sleep on a thousand-headed serpent which floated upon the surface of the waters. During a nap of some millions of years a water lily grew from his body. From this flower issued Brahma the creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having formed the world anew and created many of the gods, he proceeded to create man, w<sup>r</sup>hen the four classes or castes into which the Hindus are divided issued from different parts of the body. The Brahmans from the head, the Kshatriyas from his arms, the Vaisyas from his breast, while the Sudras had their ignoble origin in his feet. The Brahmans are supposed to be entitled to a very high rank, while the Sudras are hardly recognized as human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These four classes have from various causes been divided into many distinct castes. The people are slaves to this caste system, as there is no possibility to change from one caste to another. It is like the laws of the Medes and Persians, fixed and unalterable. The gulf is great indeed between the highest and the lowest caste, the Brahmans and the Untouchables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pernicious influence of caste is illustrated by this incident: A woman was lying by the side of the street, apparently in the agonies of death. The villagers were passing to and fro without manifesting the least interest or sympathy. When asked for an explanation of their conduct they replied: “Why should we take care of her ? She does not belong to our caste.” A little rice water had been offered her, but she would not drink it, simply because the person offering it belonged to a lower caste. Had she tasted the rice water or eaten any food cooked by those of a lower caste she would have lost her caste. And what then? Her own children would have fled from her as from one infected with a plague. Her husband would not have permitted her to enter his home. Had any friends or relatives dared to associate with her, they too would have lost their caste and been involved in the same disgrace. Thus they would necessarily become outcasts and vagabonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the device of caste there are over sixty million British-Indian subjects who are denied all social rights, including such elementals as access to public water supply; for they are believed to convey pollution, by touch, by approach and sometimes even by visibility. When walking in the street they must keep on the side opposite the sun, lest their filthy shadows should fall upon the consecrated Brahman. They are forbidden any calling save those deemed shameful, and are barred from the hope of making their children any happier than themselves. They are cakes of dirt, in the eyes of the Hindus of other castes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Untouchability, so the Hindu code teaches, is incurred by sin. For example: The man who kills a Brahman will eventually, after myriads of reincarnations upon earth in unclean insect form, be born into the world an Untouchable, the greatest curse upon a Hindu. Untouchable he will be through thousands of re-births to suffer degradation, want and pain, for sins which he is supposed to have committed, which he knows not of. But the fact of his birth in the caste of the Untouchables is proof enough of his sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By implanting and maintaining this lethal idea in the minds of the people Hinduism has atrophied the very manhood of its prey. Today there are sixty million Untouchables, creatures in human shape, most of whom submit to regard themselves no better than crawling worms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gandhi has long disowned this system. “Untouchability,” he writes, “is a snake with a thousand mouths through each of which it shows its poisonous fangs. Untouchability is for me more insufferable than British rule, and we shall be unfit for Swaraj home rule so long as we would keep the sixty million Untouchables, one-fifth of the population, in bondage. This change must precede home rule, and not follow it”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bound by an official pledge not to interfere in the religious belief of the Indian people, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Government of India has refrained from coming to the rescue of the sixty million Untouchables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This system of caste is one of the most terrible engines of tyranny and oppression that human ingenuity and selfishness can invent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no such thing as a united India or a national voice. There is no compatibility or affinity between the Mohammedan and the Hindu. They are as opposite as the poles, and so long as there is a Mohammedan in India he will go at the throat of a Hindu. A Hindu takes delight in killing a Mohammedan, and a Mohammedan takes delight in killing a Hindu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A girl is betrothed as a little child, too young to know anything about it. They are not at their own disposal in marriage. She may be betrothed to a youth, or it may be to a widower of fifty. She must, according to strict religious code, marry as soon as nature will permit (twelve years of age or less in tropical India), and in nine months will be a mother. To find an old maid in Hindustan would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. She is a phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The girl going to her husband by her twelfth year or earlier has little time or chance to learn from the Hindu shasters. But one thing she will surely have learned: her duty towards her husband. As taught in the “bible” of the Hindu peoples, there is no other god on earth for a woman than her husband. Let him be debauched, immoral, a drunkard, deformed, aged or infirm, let his defects be what they may, a wife should always look upon him as her earthly god. Thus she will enjoy the reputation of a faithful and virtuous wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Gandhi tirelessly denounces the dominance of this old teaching by which, by sheer force of a vicious custom, even the most ignorant and worthless men have been enjoying a superiority over women w’hich they do not deserve and ought not to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Child marriage and its results are terrible. Take a girl child married at twelve years of age. A pitiful physical specimen in bone and blood. Force motherhood upon her at the earliest possible moment. She must be a woman before she knows she is one. Statistics show that each generation sees the death of 3,200,000 of these child mothers in the agonies of childbirth. Their babies at birth weigh about five pounds. This is somewhat above the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These children should be playing with their dolls rather than becoming wives and the mothers of children. Boys who ought to be getting their lessons in school are rearing families, and w<sup>T</sup>e men here in the Occident w ould feel ashamed of ourselves if going into society with a little girl of twelve years of age as our wife and mother of children. There is no manhood or W’omanhood in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prayer of the parents is that the gods will give them children. But give them boys; when a boy is born there is rejoicing and jubilation, but if a daughter is bom the innocent little thing is a ‘“woo”, a hated thing. ’Tis a grievous calamity, as with the Chinese parent. So little valued is the life of a female infant that it is said “a good for nothing girl is born”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The failure to bring forth a son is the unpardonable sin, and for this a husband can put his wife aside and get another. If girls come along one after another the chances are that some of them will die. They are a cash liability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The result of such consummation before bodily development not only weakens the health of the girl, but produces children who are sick and w’eakly. Infant mortality is great. Of Indian babies born alive “Indian Statistics” show that about 2,000,000 die each year; that over 40 percent of the deaths of infants occur in the first wrnek after birth, and over 60 percent in the first month. The number of stillbirths is heavy on account of the sheer inability to bear the strain of coming into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average life of the Hindu is about twenty-three years. They have no resistance to fight against decease. They cannot transmit a strong, virile vitality to their posterity, and the husband, in the majority of cases, has to arrange for his remarriage several times during his lifetime, on account of the successive deaths of his young child waves. Early to marry, early to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mahatma Gandhi has announced that he lived with his wife as such at thirteen years of age. (Young India, 1926).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hindu widow is accursed in that the fate of widow’hood can be but for one cause: the enormity of her sins in a former incarnation. From the moment of her husband’s decease till the last hour of her own life she must expiate those sins in shame and suffering and self-immolation. Her hair is shaven, she becomes the menial of all in her late husband’s household. She can never marry again. By the death of her husband she is revealed to be a creature of innate guilt, of evil portent, and she herself is convinced of this: She has the curses of her mother-in-law<sup>7</sup> in that if it were not for her (the wretched creature) her son might be in the land of the living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The widow was formerly burned to death, thereby escaping the torture of Hindu widowhood in the hope for a happier birth in her next incarnation. The Indian government has long put a stop to the burning of widows. So she suffers her martyrdom believing that her misery is one of merit, one that the gods have pronounced upon her for her sins. The burning of widows still goes on in the independent states outside of British India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This experience is the same with the little child who is betrothed, even though she knows not her husband, never has seen him or been of his bed and board. Mr. Gandhi bitterly denounces this forcing the curses of widowhood upon a child who knows not of her husband. The number of widows is about 27,000,000. (Government Statistics) It is not surprising that many of these widows go astray and become a menace to society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some respects Mohammedan women enjoy great advantages over their Hindu sisters: their freedom from infant marriage and from enforced widowhood, with the train of miseries worked by each. But upon coming to the threshold of maturity (about twelve years of age) the Mohammedan woman is married. She then passes into a practical life of imprisonment within the walls of her home, never to leave her apartment nor see any male save her husband and her son, and never to see the outside world, from the day of their marriage till the day of her death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You look upon a little Mohammedan girl playing with other children, laughing, jumping, skipping in the joy and pleasure of her childhood life. It is sad indeed to think that in a short time she will be behind the Mohammedan veil as a prisoner for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are about 40,000,000, it is estimated,, behind the veil. This Purdah system, relegating women to the dark and dingy parts of the house, bad sanitation, confinement, lack of air and exercise, makes a perfect breeding place for the white death. Between 900,000 and 1,000,000 persons, it is estimated, die annually of tuberculosis in India. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibid., page</span><span class="font4"> 285.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peoples of India are very poor and impoverished. Farm labor is five to eight cents per day. Unskilled city workers, five to ten cents per day. Skilled workers, twelve to sixteen cents per day. (Review of Trade of India) Gandhi, on being shown the effects of his boycott on the textile industry of Lancashire, England, mills closed down, unemployment, and poverty caused thereby, remarked, “Your direst poverty is wealth indeed to the people of India.” Wages at present are slightly in advance of this schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These problems of home weigh heavily upon the mind of that great soul, Mahatma Gandhi, in his fight for the independence of India and the uplifting of the Hindu mentality, and he says, First, let us get home rule. Then we will strike at the pernicious fundamentals of Hindu religion. To do this first before getting home rule would be to cause an upheaval of the ground beneath his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new government of Great Britain will not give Mr. Gandhi any encouragement for Indian home rule. He goes back to India a disappointed man. What will happen now, we shall have to wait and see. The clouds are dark and threatening. England’s Armageddon is rapidly approaching its consummation in that land. England holds on to India for economic purposes and will not get out, till put out; and so will it be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">India is sick, ignorant, illiterate, dark, pagan, locked tight and fast in a system of religion that for thousands of yeafs has held the poor people in the most cruel bondage. God’s kingdom will release them from this. They will walk in its light and be the beneficiaries of God’s gracious designs and purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We think of that brave little band of Jehovah’s witnesses going forth with the Kingdom message and its glad tidings in this land of spiritism, theosophy and occultism. Yet, under these conditions of opposition their love for God and truth enables them to keep on keeping on. (Of course the Devil has no shame, but it would almost seem as if the situation he has created in India would be enough to develop it. It seems hard to try to analyze the mental processes of one who would labor for centuries to try to create a condition which would be an infinite reproach to the Creator if He were in any wise to blame for it. But neither the Devil nor Great Britain can dodge the responsibility for the tangle in India. Britain could have given India education; she could have helped millions of the Hindus into a larger and fuller life, and the irony of it is that if she had really spent for Indian welfare the taxes that were raised in India, both countries would today be prosperous where now both are in distress.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Removing the Cause of Epidemic and Contagious Diseases</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By H. C. Temple, M.D. (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HERE is a cause for everything that exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diversities that exist in mind and matter are not accidental, but the result of cause and effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The creative power of an infinite and almighty Jehovah was the first cause of all things; and man’s violation of Jehovah’s righteous laws resulted in his expulsion from Edenic happiness and brought upon the human race the divine curse with all its attendant evils resulting in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is the God of nature, and all violations of the laws of nature, whether wilful or through ignorance, are violations of the divine law, and as such bring evil results and added afflictions to the human race, which, if properly understood, might be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This fact has long since been recognized, and great efforts have been put forth to trace every human ill to its source and, if possible, remove the cause. Much progress has already been made in the prevention of diseases in consequence of increased knowledge of etiology, and the microscopic revelation of bacteria has brought to light many sources of human diseases hitherto unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In ancient times men resorted to fetishes and superstitions; and even today this is a great barrier to removing the cause of many ills, and to the progress of human happiness. To the ancients, and to medieval man, epidemic diseases mysteriously appeared from nowhere and disappeared for no reason. To explain them the stars w’ere called upon; to stay their progress the gods were employed, and sacrifices, prayers and fastings ordained. We now know that they are but the result of the dissemination of minute living entities carried by perfectly natural means from country to country and from man to man, attacking and destroying those weaker than themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They have their parallels in the misfortunes of agriculture, such as the occasional devastating appearances of locusts, of army worms, of cutworms, of cotton boll weevils, of gypsy moths, and many other well known enemies of the forests and fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the ancients were not so restricted in their knowledge of disease, its cause, its cure and its prevention, as many have been led to believe. Their knowledge of etiology and prophylaxis, crude as it may have been, was used to a good</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">purpose to hold in check and to stave off many human ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Babylon had a sewerage system, and brought its water supply a long distance through open channels. Later the practice of medicine became well established, physicians were licensed and their fees prescribed by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Egyptian physicians practiced various specialties and used forms of minor surgery. But the ancient Hindu excelled all others of their day in the art of surgery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ancient Hebrew’s conceived disease as an expression of the wrath of God, to be removed by moral reform, prayers and sacrifices. They ordained forms of medical jurisprudence and established public health bureaus. The valley of Hinnom was used as a garbage disposal-works for the city of Jerusalem. And Jesus speaks of this valley as a symbol of complete annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jews prescribed few remedies; they were interested chiefly in the prevention of disease. They quarantined persons afflicted with such diseases as leprosy, and burned their excreta together with any articles w’hich might become contaminated. Lepers were isolated from the company of all others, and upon the approach of anyone they were required to give w’aming by crying out, “Unclean, unclean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Persians took many precautions against epidemic diseases. Cyrus the Elder boiled drinking water for his soldiers when on his military campaigns, and employed every known agency to prevent disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Greeks gave to the w’orld Hippocrates, who is called the “father of medicine”; he w’as the greatest physician of ancient times. He w’as born in the island of Kos, about the year 460 B.C., and died in 377 B.C. He was distinguished for his remarkable skill in diagnosis, and his accurate and vivid description of morbid symptoms. Many striking sayings are scattered through his works w’hich have passed into familiar use. Among his genuine and popular writings v’e note the following: on “Prognosis”, “Aphorisms,” “Epidemics,” “Diet in Acute Diseases,” “Wounds of the Head,” and on “Air and Water”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Romans are remembered chiefly for their achievements in hygiene; they provided ventilation for their houses, practiced cremation, and built sewers, drains, public bath pools and great aqueducts.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">in sanitary science. Sanitation gave way to filth and pestilence. War, ignorance, and brutal prejudice appear to have constituted the ruling spirit, and this period stands out as the most insanitary era in the annals of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of all the progress man has made since the beginning of time, it was not until the opening of the nineteenth century that his knowledge of the human body and the enemies to w’hich it is exposed made possible the prevention of any epidemic or contagious disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first discovery of what was later proven to be a disease-producing bacterium was made about 1850, when the French pathologist Davaine, on examining the tissues of cattle which had died of anthrax, discovered the constant presence of minute rods, shown later by Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist, to be the cause of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in 1857 that the French chemist Louis Pasteur discovered the true nature of the process of fermentation, also a knowledge of the chief maladies which have scourged man and animals, and of the measures by which either the body may be protected against these diseases or the poison neutralized when once within the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pasteur showed that the aging of wine by bacteria could be prevented without changing its taste by heating it to a temperature of 55 to 60 degrees centigrade. This principle has since been applied to the preservation of milk, and now much of our milk is kept free from the harmful action of bacteria by this simple heating process, universally known as pasteurization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pasteur was the first man to demonstrate beyond dispute that all forms of microbian life have ancestors and a numerous progeny, thereby dispelling the idea that they came into existence spontaneously. He held the belief that it is within the power of man to rid himself of every parasitic disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stimulated by and coincident with the successful investigations of Pasteur, Joseph Lister, an eminent surgeon of Edinburgh, became convinced that many wound diseases are due to germs, and by using antiseptics he soon established his thesis and paved the way to the present practice of aseptic surgery. His work represents one of the most brilliant triumphs in establishing the germ theory of infectious diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist, announced in 1882 the discovery of the micro-organism of tuberculosis, causing a profound sensation throughout the world. He proved beyond a doubt that the bacteria of tuberculosis were the origin and the only cause of the long dreaded disease, The Great White Plague, consumption. So conclusive was his evidence that in a surprisingly short time it was universally accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following year, the germ of Asiatic cholera was discovered, and one year later was brought to light the bacillus of diphtheria and also that of tetanus, and further developments regarding the bacillus of typhoid fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within very recent years the terrible menace of typhoid fever has been reduced to a small and still reducible fraction of what it once was. Figures compiled by the Prudential Life Insurance Company, of Newark, N. J., show that the rate has been reduced from 32 deaths per 100,000 in 1901 to 8 in 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diphtheria is justly regarded as one of the most dreaded of the diseases of childhood. It has come down to us from antiquity under such names as “Egyptian sore throat”, “Syrian ulcer,” “malignant sore throat,” “putrid sore throat,” “gangrenous ulcer,” “membranous croup,” and the like, until the name diphtheria was given it by the French physician Breton-neau in the early part of the nineteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until the fruitful discoveries of Klebs, Loeffler, Behring, and others gave us the cause and the methods for the cure and control of diphtheria, few diseases had presented such high mortality, and there had been few before the march of which we were so helpless. An outbreak of diphtheria in a community caused a shudder of horror, for the old records are full of instances where all the children of a family were swept away in spite of all that the medical knowledge of that time could do. But thanks to our modern discoveries, there are now few diseases about which we know as much as diphtheria. Its prevention and control are feasible, provided sanitary authorities and the general public intelligently cooperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yellow fever has been until recently one of the most horrible and shunned epidemic diseases in the United States. It appeared in this country 112 times between the years 1702 and 1878, being the most frequent and destructive in the Southern states, especially in the city of New Orleans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From 1800 to 1879 yellow fever, with two exceptions, visited the United States every year. During this period the great epidemics were those of New Orleans, in which there were 290,-020 cases and 8,101 deaths, and Memphis, with 17,600 cases and 5,150 deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over four and a half million dollars were contributed in 1878 for the relief of the stricken cities of the South, involving a total estimated loss to the country of not less than $100,000,000; the epidemic of 1878 cost the city of New Orleans alone over $10,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work done by the United States Army in 1900 under the direction of Doctors Reed, Gar-roll and Lazear, in research work among the yellow fever victims in Havana, proved conclusively that yellow fever is transmitted by the Acdes aegypti mosquito. Soon after this discovery the danger of yellow fever in the United States was virtually eliminated; and in 1905, under the direction of Doctor Joseph White, of the Public Health Service, yellow fever was driven from the southern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Typhus fever prevailed in epidemic form in this country well into the nineteenth century. Now that the methods of its transmission are understood, serious epidemics of this disease need no longer be feared. The difference between the former great and the present diminished danger has been brought about, not through the discovery of the specific micro-organism, for that has still eluded the search of the bacteriologist, but through the discovery of what is of equal importance, the means by which the disease is spread. The investigations of Nicolle, Cover, and Consell of France, of Goldberger and Anderson in this country, and of Ricketts and Wilder in Mexico, beginning in 1909, have definitely proven that this disease is transmitted through the bite of infected lice. This disease is not contagious in the ordinary sense; it cannot be caught from the patient; and if the lice are prevented from passing from patient to doctor or attendant, there is no transmission of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bubonic plague killed approximately onefourth of the population of Europe in the Middle Ages. Within a generation the means of its control has been learned. Even at the present time, in places where sanitary measures cannot be enforced, the disease spreads and people die in great numbers. Thus, in India, in 1901, there were 362,000 cases, with 278,000 deaths. In the first six months of the epidemic of 1907 the deaths in India were much more numerous, reaching a total of 1,062,908.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But where sanitation is possible and cooperation between the authorities and the people succeed, as in New York, San Francisco, and other American ports to which the infection was brought, the disease did not spread. Plague seems to be primarily a disease of the lower animals, such as marmots and rats, and only secondarily, and, one might say, accidentally or incidentally a disease of human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our forefathers feared (with reason) Asiatic cholera, which is no respecter of climates. Science has made it a vague memory among the people of the United States and Europe, but it is still destroying many millions of human lives in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is probable that malaria was more responsible for the decline of the culture of both Greece and Rome than any other single feature. At the present time even this disease can be controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among several scientific aids developed in the new age, the X-ray has been of incalculable value in the study of many diseases and has helped materially in their conquest. It is difficult for one who has not made a special survey of the history of diseases to realize under what improved health conditions we are now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In marked contrast to the decline of infectious and communicable diseases is the trend of death rate from degenerative diseases, such as affections of the heart, Bright’s disease, diabetes, cancer, apoplexy, influenza and pneumonia. Not only has the death rate from these degenerative diseases failed to decline, but it has actually increased at a rather rapid rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diseases of the heart and circulatory system have increased from 70 per 100,000 in 1870 to over 300 in 1920. Where Bright’s disease caused 50 fatalities per 100,000 in 1870, it now causes almost twice that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apoplexy (cerebral hemorrhage) was causing 30 deaths per 100,000 in 1870; today it is causing 100 deaths for the same number of persons. And cancer, one of the most dreaded and deadly of this group, is steadily increasing, until now more than 100 victims per 100,000 are claimed annually, whereas in 1850 approximately 30 fell victims to the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These few examples indicate the potency of scientific investigation to combat the menace of disease and to aid in the release of a greater and stronger man power to do the world’s work. The record of the past gives certain promise to the future. A vast field for investigation yet lies before the zealous investigator into the source of human ills and the means for their relief.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Suggestions lor Flood Control</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N PRESENTING a plan to control all flood waters, develop a complete system of internal water transportation, convert 200,000,000 acres of land into nut and fruit orchards and forests of valuable timber by a plan of bonds and national bank financing, the writer takes into consideration the fact that $6,000,000,000 of farm mortgages are due or becoming due and their foreclosure is a certainty unless something big is done; this condition is further complicated by 5,000,000 Americans’ being wholly or partially unemployed and our being in the midst of the greatest depression ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If this can be done, without increase in taxation, but at a profit that in fifty years will enable the states to abolish taxation, although it proposes the largest expenditure ever made in a time of peace, the writer believes it will appeal to Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proposed expenditure does not equal the indebtedness created in 1917-20 for the World War, with this difference: then the U.S.A, mustered over 4,000,000 of the best men in the world to destroy other human creatures and property and left our country burdened with a debt of over $25,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This move will put the over 4,000,000 of idle Americans to work at good wages in transforming almost worthless plains and mountains into nut and fruit orchards and valuable forests, and control nature so that thereafter there will be neither floods nor drouths in our country, but peace, plenty and prosperity instead of poverty caused by destruction, drouth and floods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is only one diversion of water practical on the east side of the Mississippi river. That is of the Tennessee river, in Alabama, to the Tombigbee river and Mobile bay. West of the Mississippi the proposed Grand Canal will divert all flood waters from the Rocky mountain region. Heavy rains east of these at the same time that flood water is coming from the upper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Frank Hoskins, C. E. (Illinois)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mississippi and Ohio rivers might cause some flood in the lower Mississippi. To prevent it the Arkansas river could be diverted to the Red river in eastern Oklahoma; the Red river to be diverted into the Trinity river and Galveston bay, and also into the Sabine river and Sabine bay. These diversions would always keep the Mississippi river within the present embankments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Grand Canal, to divert all the flood waters of the Rocky mountains not held back by the large reservoirs in the mountains, will have two starting points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. At a big dam on the Yellowstone river, in southwest Montana, to divert all the flood waters of that river.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. A high dam on the Missouri river below the mouth of the Little Missouri river or at some other point in North Dakota or eastern Montana, to divert the flood waters of the Missouri to join the Canal from the Yellowstone river. The Grand Canal to then run south, through South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma to the Pecos river in Texas.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Along this Canal not less than 100,000,000 acres of land to be acquired on which to turn all flood waters, this land to be planted to forest and fruit trees. Black walnut is the fastest growing good timber tree and it will predominate with a view of grafting to English walnuts south of the north line of Kansas. Hickories can be planted, part to be grafted into soft shell or thin shell pecans as far north as practical. As the catalpa is the fastest growing tree, it will be planted in rows between the walnuts and hickories, to be cut for railroad ties until the size of the other trees requires the land. Pines will be planted on the sandy land, and some of all other varieties of trees will make up the forests. Forty years of falling leaves and water will make the soil equal to any in the world.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>“The New Tower of Babel”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N AN article bearing the above title which appears in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Household Magazine,</span><span class="font4"> the Reverend John Thomas Stewart, pastor of a Congregational church in a small town in the Middle West, unburdens himself quite plainly. We select, here and there, a few choice sentences, from his published reflections:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Protestant clergy of the villages and towns has lost more heavily in prestige, authority, and influence than any other professional class in America. To what depths of inconsequence have we sunk I Our sole gain has been in numbers, a hollow victory. Our lowly position in the current scheme of things American cries to that heaven once believed in for mercy if not justice. Our enemies denounce us as charlatans and our</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">friends damn us with the faint praise of “harmless”. The good old days when we parsons were the learned men of our communities are gone forever. And the denunciation of our morals has become a national pastime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The restlessness of our ministry” is a national worry with every sect. Also the cause of this unrest is thoroughly understood: with five churches struggling to exist where only one might thrive, it means that five pastors must each live by and work at onefifth of a man’s job. This over churching not only provokes restlessness in the clergy; it invites scorn from the laity. Directly because of this calamitous situation, I have never found in one of my churches a substantial family that was willing for a son to enter the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Starting with my own church: our budget is six thousand dollars. The Methodists raise at least as much, and the Baptists one thousand dollars more. That makes nineteen thousand dollars for the largest three. Ten remaining churches cost not less than six thousand dollars to maintain. The total is twenty-five thousand dollars. This is, or ought to be, an intolerable burden on a town which can boast of one wealthy family. Moreover, it must be borne in mind the burden is not equitably distributed; for a clear majority of the Protestant families does not contribute a cent to the support of any church. In other words, the multiplication of churches in the United States has accompanied a decline in the constituency. This explains though it does not condone the bizarre means which are everywhere taken to raise money for religious (sic) purposes. The burden falls heaviest upon those families whose women are active in the innumerable societies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consider that grand total for a moment. Twenty-five thousand dollars! What could not be obtained with such a sum in the way of preaching, beautiful house of worship, inspiring music, religious literature and instruction, recreational equipment and leadership, not to mention charity which in every overchurched town has to fight for a pittance. But by the time thirteen Christian churches have got what they must have in order to meet competition on a crowded field, there are little money and few workers left for Christian charity. Think what might be accomplished of spiritual and moral good if such a sum were placed in the hands of a competent committee of laymen charged with responsibility for the whole community. It is a dizzy prospect, sick with chagrin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a matter of fact, the whole system of church financing is as full of holes as a sieve, rotten with dishonesty and brazen misrepresentation. One sectarian official, a charming minister but a realist in finance, was relating to me a few weeks ago some of his experiences in dealing with rival promotional secretaries in a large city: it was a phantasmagoria of intrigue, trickery, padded statistics. He said bluntly, “We don’t expect the man responsible for promoting his denomination ’s aims to tell the truth.” Why, then, should we be surprised if our moral prestige has fallen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There ought to be a Blue Sky law passed for the protection of gullible Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inevitably the clergy suffers worst in any slump in church finances. A recent issue of a denominational journal reports cuts in preachers’ salaries from one end of the country to the other, ranging from fifty dollars to twenty-five hundred dollars. One large church, in order to save money, told its minister at the beginning of summer that his job had been dispensed with for three months, but he might return to them in the fall if he had found nothing else to do. I know of another church which had had a pastor with one child and got another pastor who had ten children, and greeted its new shepherd with a reduction in salary of four hundred dollars. His wife soon presented him with his eleventh child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The radio has only aggravated a situation which was already confusion worse confounded. We will take our seeker's schedule by hours and the Central Standard time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">7 a.m. Few Protestants are up. “Morning Watch,” wffiich includes, on an ordinary Sunday, music from church colleges, talks on Bible lessons by Fundamentalists (paradox though it is, they are far more energetic in using the radio than Modernists), hymns, prayers, and sermonettes from the larger stations, talent supplied by church federations and guaranteed to offend nobody.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8 a.m. Most of our church members are eating breakfast; some played bridge too long last night and are still asleep; many deacons are playing golf, especially men with 100-plus scores. Judge Rutherford, successor to Pastor Russell, on an international hookup denouncing all churches, preachers, and governments indiscriminately; undoubtedly listened to by more people than any other preacher, not excepting Drs. Cadman and Fosdick; equally opposed to prohibition and tobacco, and defining Christendom as the State of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">9 a.m. German Sunday Schools are in session; on the air the International Bible Lesson by a Fundamentalist contradicts everything the liberal preacher is going to say at 11 o’clock.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">10 a.m. All Sunday Schools are in session: sixty percent of all children are at home reading the comics.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">11 a.m. The Tower of Babel is filled. “The scriptures are true.” “The scriptures are partly true.” “The issue is trivial.” Typical town of 1,000, Protestant pew space for 2,100; combined attendance on all services 200. Keep that proportion for church attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">12 m. Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Unitarians, Christian Scientists have for the most part done with public religion for the week. The Tower empties.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Life Hinges on Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Scriptural conditions under which one may gain eternal life are that he must get a knowledge of the only true God; give God the first place in his heart; obey God’s commandments to the best of his ability; get a knowledge of Jesus Christ, God’s Son; accept Jesus as the bread from heaven; hear and listen to His voice; become one of His sheep; do the work Jesus gives him to do; give earthly possessions a secondary place in his heart; and show love and mercy toward all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We hope now to spend a little time together considering some of the evidence which convinces us that everlasting life and all the blessings that go with it are contingent upon obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most beautiful stories in the Bible is the account of how Isaac got his bride. The story is familiar to all, but we touch a few of the main points. It was Abraham’s desire that the bride of Isaac, his only son, should be taken from among his own people. In this story, as in many of the other experiences of Abraham, we have an allegory in which Abraham represents the heavenly Father and Isaac represents Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Abraham desired that the bride of Isaac should be taken from among his own people, so the great Jehovah God ordained that the bride of Christ should be chosen only from among those who are already in some sense His people. Abraham would not have in his family as the bride of his son a young woman taken from one of the godless families of the heathen among whom he dwelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham instructed Eliezer to go into what was then the far country of Mesopotamia to find the young woman who would thenceforth be Isaac’s life companion. The sending of this servant into a far country represents the sending of the holy spirit all the way from heaven to earth to select from among the people of God those who would be found worthy to be the everlasting companions of His Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the woman who was to be invited should prove unwilling to come, then the servant was not to be charged with any remissness. Thus is shown the fact that nobody is forced to accept the gifts of God and the ministrations of the holy spirit. They may be either accepted or rejected; the will is left free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eliezer, the servant, set out across the desert on his long trip to Mesopotamia. Ten camels bore him and his retinue. The ten camels represent the Word of God, the vehicle which throughout the period of selection has borne the holy spirit to those who are to be fellow heirs in the Kingdom with their Head and Master, Christ Jesus, our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At length Eliezer and his camels reached the city of Nahor, Abraham's deceased brother, in Mesopotamia. The Bible story of how Rebecca, the granddaughter of Nahor, was revealed to him as the Lord’s choice is so beautiful that we insert the whole story at this point just as it appears in holy writ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And he made his camels to kneel down without the city, by a well of water, at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. And he said, 0 Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink; and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in ? And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth; I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master’s brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as Laban, Rebekah’s brother, heard the story which his sister told, he ran out to Eliezer and said, “Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.” And then it tells how Laban ungirded his camels and gave them straw and provender, water to wash his feet, and food for them to eat, but Eliezer would partake of none of this food until first he had made his errand clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He went directly to the heart of the matter, stating that he was Abraham’s servant and that the Lord had blessed his master greatly and that he had come seeking a wife for Abraham’s only son. He told of Abraham’s faith that the angel of the Lord would prosper him in the way and then narrated the remarkable story of how Rebekah had been disclosed to him as God’s choice for the bride of his master’s son. He told of his gifts of bracelets and earrings to Rebekah and the account proceeds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before thee; take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We know that Laban was loath to part with his sister, for the next morning, when Eliezer wished to immediately return to Abraham with Rebekah, Laban and his mother faltered somewhat and desired that she might remain with them another ten days. It seemed hard to give her up so soon, but Eliezer insisted that there be no delay. “And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason we have told this story is that it illustrates a principle which is very dear to God; and that is, prompt obedience to His will on the part of those who discern what His will is. Both Laban and Rebekah were promptly obedient. It was hard for them to part; it meant the breaking up of their old home and the taking out of it its greatest attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a custom in patriarchal times for the oldest son to gradually become the head of his father’s house, and this seems to have been the case in the home of Bethuel and Laban, his son. Laban was evidently the active head of the home, as his name is mentioned first, and he was the principal spokesman. He could, therefore, without a doubt, have put his foot down and refused to allow his sister to depart in the company of this man, who, until a few minutes before, had been a total stranger to them both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If he had declined to entertain the proposal made by Eliezer, some other woman would have been the bride of Isaac, and therefore the mother of the “thousands of millions” that have descended from her, and that go to make up the entire Jewish race living today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Think of what this includes, comprising all the men and women most honored by the Lord for about two thousand years of human history: Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, David, Solomon, Isaiah and all the prophets, and Christ Jesus and Mary His mother, and all the holy apostles and all the early church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was Rebekah’s descendants who wrote the Bible, practically every word of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who, as ruler of Egypt, was the central figure and hero of one of the greatest stories ever written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who, on peril of his life, ten times went into the court of Pharaoh and demanded that Pharaoh should let the Israelites go out of bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was her descendants who followed Moses through the Red Sea, and under Joshua subdued the Promised Land. It was her descendants, including the rulers as well as the ruled, who went to make up the only race on earth of which God has been the real guiding head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants, a mere stripling, who put to death the great giant, Goliath, and accomplished other deeds of valor that have given him a secure place in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who had the courage to walk in and tell the king of Israel to his face of his great sin before God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who called down fire from heaven in the presence of the entire federal council of churches and their 450 priests of Baal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It w<sup>r</sup>as one of her descendants who raised the Shunammite’s son to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants, Esther, who at Mordecai’s command, took her life in her hands and went in before the great king (Ahasuerus) to plead for the life of the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It w<sup>T</sup>as three of her descendants who refused to bow down before the golden image which had been set up on the plain of Dura and were thrown alive into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who was cast into the lion’s den because he dared to disobey the law and go down upon his knees before his Creator three times a day, as was his wont, with his windows open toward Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who went in and stood before Belshazzar and told him that his kingdom had been weighed in the balance and found wanting and was about to be divided between the Medes and Persians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was principally the descendants of this woman who are referred to in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews as those “who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (Of whom the world was not worthy).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants, a beautiful young man of thirty-three, who, when He was asked, “Art thou a king, then?” calmly looked in Pilate’s face and replied, “I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was one of her descendants who a few hours later on Calvary’s brow provided the ransom price for man’s redemption from sin and death, and a few days later could say in all sincerity and truth, “All power is given unto me in heaven and earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Try to imagine the joy that will fill Rebekah’s heart when she awakens in Palestine, some happy day, before long, to find that almost the entire drama of holy writ was enacted by those who owe their existence to the fact that she obeyed the will of the Lord when Eliezer asked her to accompany him; and if her joy will be so great that we cannot fathom it, that joy will be shared by Laban her brother who first, and before consulting her, said, “The thing pro-ceedeth from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before thee; take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How does this make you feel about the matter of obedience? Does it not make you feel that when a thing proceeds from the Lord you wish to be quick to see His hand and quick to obey His voice? We all instinctively recognize that Laban and Rebekah, because of their prompt obedience, are justly entitled to the happiness that will be theirs when they awaken in the golden age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We cannot point to Moses as one who was promptly obedient; but he obeyed in the end, and until we realize that he was a fugitive from justice, in danger of apprehension as a murderer, and therefore liable to be executed, we do not get the proper focus on his conduct. He was afraid, and needed to have his fears soothed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that he had many excuses to offer. He did not consider himself a suitable person; he did not know the personal name of the real Deliverer; the people would not believe him, nor hearken to his voice; he was slow of speech; he asked that somebody be sent in his place; and though he was eighty years of age he even asked his father-in-law for a few days off, probably in the hope that the old man would say “No”. Even when he had finally started, God had still to bring to his attention the fact that in respect to his son he had been disobedient to the covenant of circumcision which God had entered into with Abraham and his posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One by one all these objections were overruled, and finally he obeyed and returned to Egypt to obey God’s commands. Thereafter everything shows that he was just the right man for the job in which he had been placed. It took courage to go in before Pharaoh and ask the privilege of leading two million of his subjects, and all their livestock and other property, out of the land. But when Moses finally got under way nothing could stop him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He had the satisfaction of going in before Pharaoh; and when the rod that Aaron bore was cast before him not only had Moses the intense satisfaction of seeing it turned into a serpent, but when Pharaoh’s spirit mediums performed a similar feat he had the satisfaction of seeing Aaron’s rod swallow up theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was forty years later that Moses died, while yet his eye was not dim nor his natural strength abated. Many a time in that forty years Moses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">r.,. GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">must have chuckled over that experience. The fact that he mentioned it when he wrote the book of Exodus shows that he remembered it, and it would be impossible to remember a thing like that without an inward smile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Moses never got another thing out of his several tilts with Pharaoh, that one alone was worth the price of admission. When the last end of the last tail of the opposing serpents went down the neck of Aaron’s, and the serpent had again become a rod in his hands, one can almost imagine overhearing Moses say to Aaron, “What do you know about that? Wasn’t that enough to take your breath? Did you see the startled look on the old boy’s face?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bright and early the next morning, Moses stood again by Pharaoh’s side and turned the waters of Egypt into blood, not only in the rivers, but in the ponds and pools of water and vessels of wood and stone. Don’t you suppose he got a big thrill out of that? That was another blessing for him to remember, and that one and the previous one would not have been his if he had not been obedient to the call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A week later he was right back there in the court telling Pharaoh that the frogs were going to overrun his whole country. How do you suppose he felt when they began to jump this way and that and you couldn’t move without having one of them jump between your legs? Moses only laughed. He knew why Pharaoh was attending that frog festival, and he never heard any music that he enjoyed more than to hear them croaking. It was just that much more proof that his mission would be a success in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next job was to tell Pharaoh and all his crowd that they were going to be lousy. Probably some of them were already that, but they were going to get worse. And they did. And when Moses and Aaron saw the Big Bugs digging in their hair for the little ones, and knew that in a few minutes they would have bigger ones and more of them, it was only fun for the two that had come to tell them the plain truth, that they must let God’s people go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And then they came to tell them about the flies. They were not going to have a few of them. They were to have just billions and billions of them. Pharaoh couldn’t open his mouth without getting twice as much fresh meat in it as there is in a 15c railroad sandwich. It was no use to try to keep them out of his nostrils or eyes or ears, and when Moses saw his arms going like a windmill in the vain attempt to brush them away he only laughed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far it was only fun. Nobody had been seriously hurt. But Moses was in desperate earnestness, and so thereafter the plagues became harder to bear. All the animals in the realm took sick. It had to be. One after another the things that Pharaoh depended upon to fortify his will were taken from him. It was his fault that the animals were taken sick. His rebellion against God’s will was the real cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is something like the financial sickness that is upon Christendom now. All the financial animals are sick. More than a thousand banks have gone down in a year’s time, some two hundred of them National banks, members of the Federal Reserve, though the Federal Reserve was brought into existence to prevent that very thing. The Federal Reserve system is an episcopalian system: it does the things it ought not to do, and leaves undone the things it should do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moses did not laugh when the animals were sick, but he did say to himself, ‘This would not need to have been if Pharaoh had been willing to let the people go, but he wouldn’t. He was determined to have his own way, and now look at him. He hasn’t a healthy piece of livestock in his entire realm.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far, Pharaoh had not personally had much trouble. He had been inconvenienced by the waters’ being turned into blood, and by the excessive quantities of frogs and lice and flies throughout his realm, and upon his person, and he had been angered by the sickness of his livestock, but the next one that was sick was himself. He had boils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have had boils, several of them at one time, say that as a source of entertainment they leave little to be desired. You wake up in the morning with them, and until you are worn out late at night you never forget that you have them. They are there, and you know where they are. You could touch each one tenderly, if you wanted to, but you don’t want to, and don’t want anybody else to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Moses looked at Pharaoh, with carbuncles bursting all over him, he had to turn his head when he laughed; but Pharaoh didn’t laugh. He didn’t feel like it. He felt like saying something. And what he felt like saying isn’t fit to print; and so we don’t print it. He had it in for Moses after that. But Moses didn’t care; he was on the Lord's side; Pharaoh was on the Devil’s side, and getting the worst of it, and deserved so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next came the hail. All the crops were ruined. Starvation was ahead of the land. How much better it would have been had he yielded to the will of God. Next the locusts came along and ate up all that the hail had spared, and then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> terrible darkness, so thick it could be felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And finally came the dreadful announcement that all the first-born of Egypt must die, from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the lowliest servant in the realm, and the first-born of beasts; in the hour when he lost the heir to his throne Pharaoh knew, and the Devil knew, that Israel would go free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Try, if possible, to picture in your mind this panorama as it was unfolded before Moses. Here, for the first time in history, was what might be called a one-man invasion of a great nation, the greatest and “wisest” and most powerful nation of its times. The man whom God selected for the invasion was a shepherd at the time, and, according to his own statements, he probably had some form of impediment of speech, doubtless the result of long years out on the ranges with his cattle, with none with whom to converse, except for a few minutes at the breaking and the close of day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meekest man in all the earth, he was finally brought to obedience, and, as a result of that obedience, came to see the mightiest empire of his time completely humbled in the dust, and 2,000,000 slaves, his own people, granted their liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How do you suppose he felt when he saw them go out of Egypt laden with the riches of the Egyptians which were their due for the unpaid labors they had performed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How do you suppose he felt when, his great army of followers all safely across the Red Sea, he stretched out his rod and the waters came in upon Pharaoh and his crowd and the fear of recapture was definitely ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How do you suppose he felt when he was up in the mountain forty days alone with God? What must have been his feelings as, at his word, food was provided, and rocks burst open to gush forth the fresh, sparkling waters which the company must have to live ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What must have been Moses’ inward joy when the tabernacle ■was reared and arrangements had been perfected for a typical meeting-place between God and man, illustrative of the realities that have come to us through Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And how did he feel when, after forty years of usefulness as the leader and teacher of this great army of people, he finally went up into the mountain to die, after first telling them that “a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me; him shall ye hear” and thus prophetically he looked ahead to the coming of the Son of God, the great Savior and Deliverer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">None of these, and of countless other blessings that came to Moses in those forty years, would have been his portion except for his obedience. Had he not obeyed he would have lived perhaps a few years longer an unknown shepherd back there in Arabia Petrea, and then he would have died and have left no impress upon mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How is it now? Moses is rightly considered one of the grandest persons in all history, strong, humble, wise, loving, gentle, just, merciful, faithful and self-sacrificing. Great as a lawgiver, great as a general, great as a ruler, there is no question that he always sought to honor God’s name above all others, and sought the welfare of his fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When he awakens from the sleep of death and takes the place that is awaiting him as one of the visible administrators of earth’s affairs in God’s kingdom here below, he will surely be one of those that will shine with the glory of God, even as away back there he had to wear a veil over his face before the children of Israel could look upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The thing that Moses then sought to bring about will come to pass easily and naturally, because Christ as its invisible ruler will be directing and overruling all of earth’s affairs. It will be easy then for Moses and Joshua and David and all the other faithful ones to give the people the kind of government they need and for which they were taught to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the realm of the law, and as an administrator, there will be none that will occupy a higher place than this man, this shepherd, who at length was persuaded that it was the will of God he should leave his flocks and herds and appear as His representative in the court of Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Disraeli (sometimes called Lord Beaconsfield), Louis Brandeis, and other great lawgivers of his own and other races, will esteem it their greatest honor and their greatest privilege to come and learn at the feet of the man who in his day was “the meekest man in all the earth”, and they will find him as meek in the future as he was in the past. &quot;The meek will he [God] guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the greatest men of the earth assemble in council, in the age that is at hand, none will have a more honored place than Moses, and he will have that place because he was obedient; and he would have had no place at all had he not been obedient. His only regret then will be that he did not more immediately recognize and accept the will of God when it was first revealed to him in the burning bush back there in the desert of Arabia Petrea, some thirty-five hundred years ago, and undertake without argument and without delay the arduous duties which he so well performed when he finally came to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Eradicate Insects </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. C. T. Betts (Ohio J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">OPULAR MECHANICS,</span><span class="font4"> issue of September 21, 1931, contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Insects around the home, such as roaches, ants, croton bugs and bedbugs, can be destroyed by using a solution of alum, 2 lb., dissolved in 3 or 4 qt. of water. Heat this solution to the boiling point and apply it to the cracks and crevices with a brush, where the insects are likely to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is it not wonderful how the editor of a magazine like </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Popular Mechanics</span><span class="font4"> will publish the truth about a simple matter of this kind where it affects roaches, bedbugs or ants, yet will publish nothing against the alum used in baking powders for human food? Probably he thinks the little, delicate cells of the human body are more powerful to resist poisons of this character than the vermin above mentioned.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark121"></a>They Are Beautifully Bound, Too</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N THESE times of perplexity, trouble and oppression people are apt to feel depressed and they often turn to reading as a means of diverting the mind. This diversion is often an expensive proposition, however. To spend two dollars, or even a dollar, for a novel which is read and laid aside is extravagant, especially in these times. Rental libraries charge fifteen to twenty-five cents merely for the use of a single book, which must be returned in a few days, and therefore must be read hurriedly. Popular magazines cost from ten to thirty-five cents a copy and are usually filled with advertisements and much frivolous reading, or reading of negative value. At the best, these means of diversion provide but a few hours of forgetfulness, leaving the mind still more dissatisfied with things as they are. They fail to supply what people really need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford’s books are different. They will bring both pleasure and profit. They will bring you knowledge concerning things that you never thought could be understood by human creatures. The Bible is made as plain as A B C; and more thrilling than any fiction ever written. Make the experience of thousands of other people your own: the experience of finding that the Bible is, after all, a sensible, understandable and believable book, and that it has a most practical and important message for every intelligent creature really alive to the significance of the present. You can share this genuine pleasure and profit with thousands of others by sending in the coupon below. The charge for these books is no more than you would pay a rental library for the use of a book, or what you might pay for a magazine. These books, however, you may retain permanently and refer to again and again, each time receiving added inspiration and help from them.</span></p>

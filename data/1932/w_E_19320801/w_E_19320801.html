<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>JEHOVAH’S EXECUTIONER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.’’—John 5: 22,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has been pleased to use a woman to picture his universal organization which gives birth to his capital organization. He caused a picture to be made in the early days, using Abraham and his wife Sarah, and his son Isaac, by which he foreshadowed his royal house that shall rule the world in righteousness. In that picture Abraham represented Jehovah God, Sarah represented God’s universal organization, and Isaac represented the royal house of which Christ Jesus is the Head. Jehovah names his woman or organization “Zion”. As Sarah was barren for a long while, even so Zion was barren for a long while. When the Lord appears at the temple Zion is built up and her children are then bom, which means the kingdom begins and those who constitute the royal house are brought into the temple or house of the Lord. The children of Jehovah, born of his woman Zion, are taught of God and enjoy great peace. Such is the present situation of God’s remnant. (Isa. 54:1-13) It is Jehovah’s children by Zion, to wit, The Christ, that constitutes Jehovah’s executioner, because it is written concerning such: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.”—Isa. 54:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> For the purpose of deceiving mankind and turning them away from Jehovah God, Satan has mimicked Jehovah in regard to his organization, as well as in other matters. Satan’s woman is named Babylon. As Zion gives birth to the true worshipers of Jehovah, so Babylon gives birth to the false religions of which Satan the Devil is the father and to those who worship the Devil and his unrighteous system. Satan’s women or organization is hypocritical, unclean, abominable, and the shedder of righteous blood. She makes a show of herself by her outward appearance, claiming to be righteous, but she is desperately wicked. “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABY</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LON </span><span class="font3">THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AND </span><span class="font3">ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. ’ ’—Rev. 17: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Ahab, being an Israelite, was bound by his cove-vant to worship and serve Jehovah, even as Lucifer was duty-bound to worship and serve Jehovah God. Ahab was a covenant-breaker and in violation of God’s law he married that Zidonian woman Jezebel and embraced the Devil religion of Baal. The Zidonians were an abomination unto Jehovah. (2 Ki. 23:13) “And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.”—1 Ki. 16:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* It was Jezebel that brought the Devil religion to the house of Ahab by which the name of Jehovah was defamed in Israel. She was a cruel, covetous and wicked murderess. Like the Devil’s woman Babylon, she ‘was drunk with the blood of God’s faithful people unrighteously shed’. Ahab and Jezebel brought forth wicked children who likewise defamed God’s holy name. Ahab, therefore, was a picture of the Devil, and Jezebel pictured or represented the Devil’s organization, and their children pictured the ‘seed of the Serpent’. At the very beginning God had said: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Gen. 3:15) Jehovah commissioned Jehu as his executioner to destroy the house of Ahab and the Devil worship of Baalim. In this Jehu foreshadowed Christ Jesus who shall bruise Satan’s head and destroy his organization. —Rom. 16: 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Jehu had destroyed the kings, and now old Jezebel was due for her turn. She knew that she must expect a visit from Jehu, and hex* vanity led her to take steps to try to overreach Jehu by reason of her appearance. “And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out of a window.” (2 Ki. 9: 30) Jezebel was the grandmother of King Ahaziah, who had already been executed. She was old and ugly, no doubt, but she resorted to paint and other artificial means, padded herself well, and framed her head and bust in a lattice window. She had for a long while been dictating the policy of Israel, and now she reasoned that the newly anointed king Jehu had no right to remove her and her cruel, covetous and commercial associates, and that her very appearance would so dazzle the king that he would give her a place in the kingdom and still permit her to perform.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> How well that illustrates the devilish systems that have long dominated the world, and particularly is that true of ‘ ‘ Christendom ”. “ Organized Christianity, ’ ’ so called, is dominated by a covetous, commercial spirit, and Big Business is the chiefest one in her councils and the one part of Satan’s organization that uses “organized Christianity” for commercial purposes. “Organized Christianity,” or “Christendom”, which embraces the seventh world power, considers herself so important that she believes she will never be deposed, but that earth’s new King Christ Jesus will need her to govern and control things; and hence she has her windjammers the clergy to tell the people that “We are going to make the world a fit place for man, and then Christ can come to visit it ’ ’. Like old Jezebel, she puts on her best bib and tucker and takes her seat at her lattice window with the avowed purpose of “vamping” the King. So cocksure are the ruling factors of Satan’s visible organization that they are impregnable in their position that they tell the people that they alone can make this world a fit place in which to reside. They are in their own estimation “the higher powers”, to which all others should be subjected. They have induced many who have consecrated themselves to the Lord to believe that gross falsehood. So thoroughly do some of them believe it that they say: “We must do nothing to offend the higher or ruling powers of the nations. ’ ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Jezebel reasoned that she could show Jehu that if he expected to continue in peace he must not be against her and her brood. A few years before Zimri had slain his master, and she would call that to the attention of Jehu in order to press home her point. (1 Ki. 16: 8-20) “And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?”— 2 Ki. 9:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">•The clergy of “Christendom”, and the principal ones of their flock, in substance say this very thing to the incoming King Christ Jesus. They at least say to the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, who represent the Lord, the Greater Jehu, in substance what Jezebel said to Jehu. Their speech is: ‘Will you have peace in turning against the ones who are ‘‘ the higher powers”, and who are ordained of God? because it is written that there is no power except of God, and that means the rulers of the world. Surely you are wrong in declaring a message against the rulers of “Christendom” and saying that God’s anointed King will destroy “Christendom” at Armageddon. You will certainly experience the fate of all who have raised sedition against the government in times past.’ The clergy and their allies try to make trouble for Jehovah’s witnesses and seek their destruction. They try to dampen the zeal of the remnant by declaring that almost all of Jehovah’s witnesses are dupes and perverts engaged in a book-selling scheme at the instance of selfish men. A sample of this howl appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Church Chronicle</span><span class="font3"> for the diocese of Ballarat, Australia, of November 15, 1931, one of the official church organs of the seventh world power. Three and one-half pages of that paper are devoted to a tirade against Jehovah’s witnesses; and that is just a sample of what they are doing in other places more secretly, and marks the beginning of a conspiracy against God’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Jehu refused to be impressed or influenced by Jezebel’s presumptuous words, nor was he at all frightened by what she said. He refused to slack his hand in the performance of his commission. He knew that he was the anointed of Jehovah to perform his work. Jehu took in the situation immediately when he saw the old woman and heard her words: ‘ ‘ And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. ’ ’—2 Ki. 9: 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are now raising this same question, identically, throughout “Christendom”. As Jehu said, so they are saying, “Who is on the Lord’s side? who?” By means of radio, books and booklets the message is going to the people, and all are told that the hope of the world is Jehovah’s kingdom and that if they would have his blessings they must take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Hence the question, “Who is on the side of Jehovah?” The religious systems in particular have amongst them many people who must have an opportunity to hear and who must be served with notice concerning God’s purposes. By the publication of false statements, such as that published by the above-mentioned paper, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Church Chronicle,</span><span class="font3"> the Jezebel crowd acknowledge that they have received notice from the Lord delivered by his remnant. Although many of them have tried to avoid this notice by refusing to accept the literature, by their very course of action they acknowledge that they have received notice. Others are standing by and they must have an opportunity to say whether or not they are on the Lord’s side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> There were some eunuchs up in that house who leaned out of the window to ascertain who was in the street propounding the question, ‘Who is on the Lord’s side?’ Who these eunuchs were we do not know, and that is not the material point. They were merely there to fill in some part of the picture. They were clearly not Israelites, for the reason that God’s law prohibited the performance of the surgical operation by which eunuchs are made. (Deut. 23:1) Probably these eunuchs were slaves who had been captured by the commercial element working under Ahab and Jezebel, and had been made eunuchs and assigned to serve the old woman and her household. In any event these eunuchs were sharp-witted enough to take in the situation immediately when they saw the conqueror Jehu there calling out and asking, “Who is on my side?” These eunuchs well picture those peoples of “Christendom” who have been robbed of their manhood and their property and forced to attend hand and foot upon the old granny, that is to say, the old wicked organization of Satan that dominates and oppresses the peoples of earth and which is guilty of many whoredoms and witchcrafts and in whose skirts is found the blood of the prophets, the faithful witnesses of Jehovah God. (2 Ki. 9:22; 1 Ki. 19:10; 18:4; Rev. 17:6) The God of battle, acting by the Greater-than-Jehu, takes action in behalf of this very class.—Jas. 5:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Jehu gave the command concerning the old woman. “And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. ’ ’ (2 Ki. 9: 33) Today the Greater-than-Jehu, the Lord Jesus Christ, says to all who would stand on the side of Jehovah and against the Devil’s old woman his wicked organization: “Throw her down.” Throw down the Devil’s organization and all of its sponsors. Throw it down by getting away from it and letting it fall. To the “great multitude” the Lord now says: ‘Go forth and show yourselves.’ (Isa. 49: 9) To the peoples of good will the Lord says concerning Satan’s organization: ‘Forsake her and leave her to be trampled under the hoofs of the King's horses. ’—Rev. 19:14-16; Jer. 51: 6; Isa. 63:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Jezebel was thrown down just as that great city, Satan’s organization, will be thrown down. (Rev. 18: 21) It was Jehu who was responsible for the death of old Jezebel, and the Greater-than-Jehu Christ Jesus will take the responsibility for the death of Satan’s organization. The eunuchs, therefore, would more specifically picture those who throw the devilish thing overboard by forsaking and abandoning it, getting free from it. It is the Lord’s army that will trample underfoot the satanic organization pictured by Jezebel. This was pictured in Ezekiel’s prophecy by the ‘six men with slaughter weapons’, which constituted the fighting army of the Lord; and these will bring about the destruction of Satan's organization. In their execution work they begin with the religionists and go down the line, making a complete clean-up of the entire wicked thing. (Ezek. 9:5-7) At the present time Jehovah’s witnesses, pictured by the ‘man with the writer’s inkhorn, clothed with linen’, go through the land marking those who are in sympathy with the Lord’s cause, but they do not put any marks upon Satan’s organization and hence Satan’s organization are the ones that shall be executed. Like as old Jezebel marked herself, so Satan’s organization marks herself for destruction. Like as Haman was hanged, so that wicked organization will be hanged high.—Esther 7: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Jezebel was Satan’s representative, and therefore the daughter of a king; hence Jehu gave orders concerning her: ‘ ‘ And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter. And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.” (2 Ki. 9: 34, 35) This part of the record evidently is merely to show that this Jezebel was disposed of without an honorable burial and as a vile thing and in disgrace. Even so Satan’s organization will be disposed of and scattered upon the ground that the dogs and the carrion birds may feed upon it. When those who went out to look after the body of Jezebel came to the place the only thing that they found of the old woman was her skull, which she had used to devise wicked schemes; and her feet, with which she walked after the ways of her father Satan; and the palms of her hands, with which she committed deeds of wickedness and violence. This is exactly in accord with what shall come upon Satan’s organization, as stated by the prophets. (Rev. 19:17-21) “And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God, Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.” (Ezek. 39:17) Satan’s organization, represented by Jezebel, will go down with all others of the Zidonians. (Ezek. 32:30) Since the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses are part of the “servant” class, and therefore part of the executioners whom Jehu pictured, it seems that the remnant will see this wicked organization thrown down by the fighting army of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The old wicked Jezebel had reached the end of her reign of terror, even as Satan’s organization is about to the end of her tether. Jehu was acting under the direction of the Lord, even as Christ Jesus, acting under the commandment of Jehovah, will destroy Satan’s organization. It is recorded that when the facts were reported to Jehu he called attention to the prophecy that Elijah had uttered: “Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.” (2 Ki. 9: 36, 37) This marked the fulfilment of the prophecy uttered by Elijah at the diree-tion of Jehovah and proved that Elijah was God’s true prophet. “And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jez-reel.” (1 Ki. 21:23) The greater fulfilment of the prophecy appears to be in the near future.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The word of Jehovah concerning the house- of Ahab and Jezebel was fully vindicated with the destruction of that house. In his due time Jehovah God will completely vindicate his word and his name concerning Satan and his organization by the full and complete destruction thereof. Jehu had done the work well concerning the house of Ahab and Jezebel, but he was not yet through with his execution work specified in his commission. There was something more for him to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ZEAL FOR JEHOVAH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Jehu had much zeal for Jehovah, and that is another reason why he pictured Christ the royal Executioner. Concerning the Lord Jesus it is written •. “For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69: 9) Such is the zeal peculiar to the royal house and therefore is pleasing to Jehovah. Elijah manifested like zeal for the Lord of hosts. After he had slain the prophets of Baal, and then went and hid himself in a cave at Mount Horeb, in response to an inquiry from the Lord as to why he was there Elijah said: “I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts.” (1 Ki. 19:10) The word “jealous” in this text means the same as ‘zealous’ in Psalm 69: 9. The two words are derived from the same root. ‘Jehovah is a jealous [zealous] God.’ (Ex. 20:5; Deut. 5:9) “For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” (Deut. 4:24) Concerning the establishment of the righteous government under Christ the King it is written; “The zeal of the Lord of hosts [Lord of battle] will perform this.” (Isa. 9:7) In the New Testament the words “zealous” and “jealous” are from the same root word: “For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy.” (2 Cor. 11:2) When Paul was defending himself before the Jews he said of himself: ‘I was taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.’ (Acts 22:3; Phil. 3:6; Col. 4:13) The remnant of God who are anointed to do his work must have this same zeal for Jehovah. “Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. ’ ’ (Titus 2:14) The words “zealous” and “jealous” as used in the above scriptures do not mean ill will or hatred or envy, but they do mean a strong, unbending determination to carry out the righteous purpose of the Lord. They mean an unbreakable determination to accomplish that which one is commissioned by the Lord to do. The means by which Jehu was identified was his rapid driving. He drove “furiously”, or with “madness”, and with an unbending and unbreakable determination that he would permit nothing to hinder him in the accomplishment of his purpose for which he was commissioned. In the very hour that he received his commission he started with his military staff to execute that commission. When the messengers of the kings approached him and inquired why he was thus driving he said to them: ‘Get out of my way, and get in the rear; I have no time to waste with you. ’ Likewise when Christ Jesus received the order from Jehovah to go forth and rule in the midst of the enemy he started the war in heaven and ousted Satan and his angels from heaven and cast them down to the earth. The Scriptures show that just as soon as the testimony work now in progress is completed, according to the will of Jehovah, Jesus will move without delay and will permit nothing to hinder him in executing the enemy. (Ps. 110:1-6; Rev. 11:17-19; 12:7-12; Matt. 24:14,21,22; Ps. 45: 3, 4) The members of the body of Christ, including the remnant now on the earth, must have this same zeal as that which was manifested by Jehu. To see and to appreciate the fact that the kingdom is here means that the remnant must be diligent in performing their work until every vestige of the enemy organization falls. (Isa. 6:9-12) Jehovah has commanded that the testimony which does the marking must be done before the slaughter work begins, and the remnant are zealous to do it, fully determined that by the grace of God nothing shall prevent them from doing it faithfully. “I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I made haste, and delayed not, to keep thy commandments. My zeal hath consumed me; because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.”—Ps. 119: 59, 60,139.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> In doing this work in the name of Jehovah of hosts the remnant must drive rapidly, and many call them mad perverts for so doing. But it matters not what the enemy says; they are doing it with joy. When David went out to fight in the army of the Lord he said: “The king’s business required haste.” (1 Sam. 21: 8) When the Lord’s anointed see and appreciate that the kingdom is here they see that it is time to make haste in obeying God’s commandments. They are diligent to make their calling and election sure. (2 Pet. 1:11) They engage in the Lord’s service with a zeal peculiar to Jehovah’s house. “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. ’ ’—Zeph. 3:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHONADAB</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehu had progressed with his work of execution and had slain the kings and sons of Ahab and others, and when he finished with the forty-two adherents of Ahaziah he met up with Jehonadab. Jehu put the question to Jehonadab: “Are you on my side or not?” By that time Jehonadab would have heard what Jehu was doing, or probably Jehu told him he was destroying Baalism in Israel; otherwise Jehonadab would not have understood the question Jehu put to him: “And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand: and he took him up to him into the chariot.” (2 Ki. 10:15) Manifestly Jehovah permitted Jehonadab to appear in this picture for some good purpose and that purpose when known must be an encouragement and comfort to the remnant. It docs not appear from the record that Jehonadab did anything toward the slaying work. What, then, did Jehonadab represent in this picture ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Jehonadab represented or foreshadowed that class of people now on the earth during the time that the Jehu work is in progress who are of good will, are out of harmony with Satan’s organization, who take their stand on the side of righteousness, and are the ones whom the Lord will preserve during the time of Armageddon, take them through that trouble, and give them everlasting life on the earth. These constitute the “sheep” class that favor God’s anointed people, because they know that the anointed of the Lord are doing the Lord’s work. In support of this conclusion the following is submitted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Jehonadab was not a Jew, nor was he anointed to do work in the name of Jehovah, arid therefore he could not picture the anointed class. He was a descendant of Abraham through his wife Keturah. (Gen. 25:1,2; Ex. 2:16; Num. 10:29; Judg. 4:11; 1 Chron. 2:55) Jehonadab was the son of Rechab the Kenite. Abraham had six sons by Keturah after the death of Sarah. Keturah represented the New Covenant, the seed or offspring of which covenant is the restitution class that shall live forever. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font3"> pages 270, 325.) “And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.” (Gen. 25:5) Isaac pictured the “seed”, that is to say, Jehovah God’s anointed. “Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.” (Gal. 4:28) The descendants of Keturah pictured the restitution class; hence Jehonadab pictured the same class.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“The name “Jehonadab” means (according to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Strong) “</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah-largess ”, that is to say, liberal, generous and bountiful. According to another authority the name means “Jehovah is bounteous”. His name, therefore, would suggest that Jehonadab pictures the class to whom Jehovah is very generous. The Rechabites were sticklers for observing what they considered to be right as they were taught. The Scriptures show that Jehonadab followed the course of honesty and meekness and did what he believed to be right, and that he taught his children righteousness and that they followed a like course. The descendants of Jehonadab received a commandment from man, but not from Jehovah, that they must drink no wine for ever, that they should not build houses, but must dwell in tents. That meant that they must lead a simple life of self-denial. Their faithfulness in doing what they had been taught because they understood it to be right the Lord used by way of comparison with the unfaithfulness of Israel in failing to do what they were commanded by him. God had commanded the Israelites that they should not eat at the Devil’s table, which meant that they should have nothing to do with Devil worship, and the Israelites disregarded this commandment and turned to Baalism or Devil worship. Today the so-called “organized Christianity” entirely disregards the commandments of the Lord and attempts to eat and drink at his table and at the same time to partake of the Devil’s table. “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils. ’ ’—1 Cor. 10: 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> To show that the descendants of Jehonadab were more pleasing to the Lord Jehovah than were the Israelites, he commanded Jeremiah to set before these Rechabites pots of wine and request them to drink it. Jeremiah did, and the Rechabites refused to drink, giving as their reason that Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, had commanded that they should not drink wine for ever. (Jer. 35:1-10) By way of comparison the Lord then directed Jeremiah to say to the Jews: “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.” (Jer. 35:14) Jehovah had sent his prophets to teach the Jews and to warn them to do right and they had not obeyed him. But the children of Jehonadab had done what they had been taught to be right, and their teaching was from merely a man. (Jer. 35:15-17) They were therefore more faithful than the covenant people of God. Today there are on earth many people of good will, and who make no pretense of being members of “organized Christianity”, but who strive to do right and who believe on God and his Word, and on Christ Jesus, and who study the truth and worship Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Jehonadab was against the Devil worship of Baalism. When Jehu said to him, “Are you in heart sympathy with the work I am doing?” Jehonadab answered that he was in sympathy with Jehu. Jehonadab knew that Jehu was doing the Lord Jehovah’s work and that it was a righteous work, and he was in full sympathy with it. Even so today the peoples of good will on earth, who believe in Jehovah God and his Word, believe that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a righteous work in the name of Jehovah, and they are in full heart sympathy with such work and they tell others so. Jehu then gave Jehonadab his hand and took him up into his chariot. That was an invitation to come along with and associate himself with the Jehu class doing the Lord’s work. This corresponds to many good people of today who are hearing the truth, many of whom attend the conventions of God’s people and who support Jehovah’s witnesses with full heart sympathy and associate themselves with the anointed who are doing the work of the Lord, and who take some part in giving the testimony also.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">*<sup>s</sup> Jehu then evidently told Jehonadab what he was going to do: “And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. So they made him ride in his chariot.’’ (2 Ki. 10:16) Jehu was not boasting of his zeal. He was known to be a man of earnest determination and active when fighting in the army of Ahab, just as Paul was a very zealous man in enforcing the law before ho knew Christ. Jehu’s words therefore merely mean that he was going to accomplish God’s purpose, and he invited Jehonadab to come and see that he would do it in the name of the Lord and do it faithfully; therefore he says: ‘Come and see what I am going to do.’ “So they made him [Jehonadab] ride in his [Jehu’s] chariot.” This suggests that now the Jehu class are accompanied by a class of people of good will who go along with God’s organization but which people are not begotten or anointed of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Jehu, by giving his hand to Jehonadab, in symbol said: “I will use my power for you and give you aid.” Jehu was engaged in the slaughtering of Devil worshipers, but was showing favor to all who took their stand on Jehovah’s side. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to declare that the day of the vengeance of Jehovah is at hand and to tell those who are meek and honest and who love righteousness to take their stand on the side of the Lord, and to such the Lord says: “Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” (Zcph. 2: 2, 3) The Jehonadab class are meek, that is to say, they are teachable and they seek to do right and are anxious for the kingdom to be established, and it is this class that Jehovah’s Word shows he will take through the Armageddon trouble. In this connection mark what God directed Jeremiah to say to the descendants of Jehonadab: “And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Kechabites, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you; therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> There shall not a man be cut off from Jonadab the son of Rechab] to stand before me for ever.” (Jer. 35:18,19) This supports the conclusion that these will be taken through Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>a</sup>’To ‘the man with the writer’s inkhorn by his side’, which is the “faithful servant” class of Jehovah, the remnant, the commandment is given to ‘go through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the foreheads of all those that sigh and cry for all the abominations that aro done in the midst thereof’. (Was not Baal worship an abominable thing in the mind of Jehonadab? and did not he say he was in full sympathy with Jehu’s work of destroying it?) When such witness work is done Jehovah then sends ‘the six men with the slaughter weapons’ to do the slaying work, and to them he says, ‘ ‘ Slay utterly . . . ; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark ’ ’; thereby meaning that these that are marked are to be preserved. (Ezek. 9:4-6) It is the Jehonadab class that are marked, and these are to be spared.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> When Jehu went into the temple of Baal for inspection before the slaughter work there began Jehonadab was with him and observed what he was doing, and this suggests that the class that are ‘marked in their foreheads’ today associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and know what they are doing and are in full sympathy with their work. By associating himself with Jehu and going into the house of Baal Jehonadab gave notice to others that he was on the Lord’s side. Even so today the peoples of good will who take their stand on the side of Jehovah, by associating with Jehovah’s witnesses in supporting them, let it be known by their course of action that they are against the organization of Satan. The class pictured by Jehonadab seems to correspond exactly with the “sheep” class mentioned by the Lord, which class gives aid, comfort and support to God’s anointed witnesses because they are doing the Lord’s service. Concerning such Jesus said: “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.” (Matt. 25: 35) Thus the bounteousness and goodness of Jehovah is shown to this class as the name Jehonadab signifies. The foregoing is a confirmation of the Scriptures proving that millions now living will never die and shows that the Lord’s anointed have been right in declaring this truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses now have the zeal like to that of Jehu and they should encourage the Jehonadab class to come along with them and to take some part in proclaiming to others that the kingdom of God is at hand. “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) Let the anointed encourage all who will to take part in telling the good news of the kingdom. They do not have to be anointed of the Lord in order to declare the Lord’s message. It is a great comfort to Jehovah’s witnesses to now know that they are permitted to carry the waters of life to a class of people that may be taken through Armageddon and given everlasting life on the earth by reason of the bounteous goodness of Jehovah.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BAAL WORSHIPERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> Many peoples in this day are induced to practice Satanic worship under various forms. One of the most subtle of the Devil’s corrupt schemes of worship is that of so-called “Christian Science”. This is a misnomer, of course, because the very teachings of this class repudiate the blood of Christ Jesus. There are many other forms of Devil worship. The remnant have a duty to perform in telling the people about the satanic organization and how it has defrauded and oppressed the people, and also of telling them of God’s kingdom and the relief and blessings it will bring, and, above all, the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehu proceeded to inform the people to take a course of action that would divide the Baal worshipers from those who are on the side of the Lord. ‘ ‘ And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu shall serve him much.” (2 Ki. 10:18) This was not a fraud or a lying scheme on the part of Jehu. He was merely using sagacity in taking a wise course in harmony with what Jesus has told his followers. (Matt. 10:16) Esther and Mordecai followed a similar course, hiding her identity until the proper time for her to declare herself. The purpose of Jehu was to assemble the practitioners of Baalism and get them to clearly identify themselves; hence he sent them word to assemble. Today all religions in the land are walking on together. Catholics and Protestants, Jews, Christian Scientists, Theosophists, and others, are all made one by their father the Devil. Even the representatives of Big Business have tried to cause the exclusive use of the radio facilities to be turned over to this unholy combine of religionists. The people now must be informed. Jehu was making known then that Ahab had displeased God by serving Baal, and in a sagacious way he said: “Jehu shall serve him much.” That was an ironical statement, however.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Jehu called for all the preachers, prophets and priests, regardless of age, nationality or previous condition of servitude, to assemble in one body at the house of Baal. “Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal: whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it. And Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the. worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.” (2 Ki. 10:19-21) He got the whole bunch lined up on one side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> In a similar manner the Lord today is causing his “servant” class to publish far and wide the great fact and truth that this is the day of decision and that the Devil is assembling his hosts for the final conflict and that the people should get on one side or the other. If they want to serve the Devil, get on his side and do so, and show it openly. If they are for Jehovah God, follow him and obey his commandments; take their stand on his side. As Elijah said, so now Jehovah’s witnesses say: ‘If Jehovah be the Almighty God, follow him; if the Devil be god, follow him.’ (1 Ki. 18: 21) Let the line of demarkation be clearly drawn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> When the time came to destroy certain ones in Egypt Jehovah caused them to be marked and designated as the ‘ ‘ firstborn ’ ’. The firstborn of Israel were saved only by virtue of the fact that they obeyed the commandments of the Lord. Likewise Jehu carried out God’s orders to mark all the Devil worshipers, priests, preachers, prophets and all. By their course that they took they marked themselves. “And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.” (2 Ki. 10:22) When these Baal worshipers got their garments on they thereby openly acknowledged themselves to be worshipers of the Devil. Likewise today -the Lord permits all the Devil worshipers to identify themselves. This they do by taking their stand on the side of the Devil after full and fair warning, and thereby they mark themselves for destruction. Jehovah’s witnesses are charged with the responsibility of giving this warning, even as God charged Ezekiel, and their failure to do so would bring God’s adverse judgment upon them. (Ezek. 3:7-21) Those who do not heed the warning of Jehovah’s witnesses are not marked with an intelligent understanding and appreciation of the kingdom, and hence they take their stand in the Devil’s company. In full corroboration of this conclusion it is written: “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.”—Rev. 14: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> After these Devil worshipers got on their glad garments Jehu took Jehonadab and went into the house of Baal to see that the trap was entirely and properly set. “And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord, but the worshippers of Baal only.”—2 Ki. 10: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> Jehu was particular to see that no one remained in that house and took part in the Devil worship except those who were on Baal’s side. Today Jehovah’s witnesses go right into the midst of ‘organized religionists’ that worship Satan and give a warning to those who claim to worship the Lord, in order that no one may be forgotten or left there without a warning. This warning is given by carrying the message of truth to the people and calling upon the people to take their stand upon the side of the Lord or upon the side of the Devil. This was particularly begun on the 26th of July, 1931. (See Resolution adopted at the Columbus convention on the above date.) The witness work is progressing and it is marking and separating the people. Jehovah gives directions to the ‘six men with slaughter weapons’ to begin the slaughter work after the witness work is done, and warns them to do no harm to those who have the mark in their foreheads but to slay all the others. While the marking work is going on the “faithful servant” class, Jehovah’s witnesses, forming a part of the Jehu company, are also gathering coals of fire from off the altar and scattering them over the city, and within a short time the slaughter work shall begin.—Ezek. 9: 6; 10:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> It is interesting to note how well the picture of Jehu and the prophecy of Ezekiel dovetail and corroborate each other. As it is shown in the Ezekiel vision the Lord sends “six men” to do the slaughter work, so it appears that Jehu employed a company of fourscore men to do the slaughter work upon this crowd and warned these men not to let a single one of the Baal worshipers escape. This shows that God’s purpose is to completely clean up the satanic worship in the earth. “And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.” (2 Ki. 10:24) Jehu made it clear that there was to be no falling down or failure in the performance of duty, like as Saul had failed when he was commanded to slay the Amalekites. The device that Jehu employed definitely identified every Baal worshiper by letting them choose their own means of identification, which they did by putting on the Baal vestments. Likewise this shows how Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus chooses the delusions of the satanic worshipers that they might go true to form of the Devil worship and honestly disclose themselves as being for the Devil.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3T</sup> Jehu waited until all the Baal worshipers in the temple had made an end of their burnt offerings, and were showing their devotion to the Devil, and then he sent his men in to clean them up. “And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.” (2 Ki. 10:25) This exactly corresponds to the slaughter work done by the “six men” in Ezekiel’s prophecy. (Ezek. 9:5-8) Moses did a similar work. (Num. 25: 5) Every Baal worshiper was destroyed and their bodies cast out. Doubtless the dogs and the birds fed upon their carcasses also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Jehu then caused all the images of wood, which are images of the lesser deities, and the images of stone, to be burned and destroyed and broken up, and the house destroyed: “And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them. And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.” (2 Ki. 10: 26, 27) According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font3"> “And they break down the pillars of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and appointed it for a sewer-house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">—<sup>39</sup> These scriptures strongly suggest that Christ Jesus and his army, the Greater-than-Jehu, will take the base of operations of the enemy and go into the very private quarters of the Devil’s organization, and destroy everything in connection with his organization, including the conspirators of his invisible organization, as well as all of the tangible part of the Devil’s worship and organization on earth. (Ezek. 28:17-19) This is further supported by the prophecy of Ezekiel 39:6: “And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly [securely, R.V.] in the isles; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” This pictures the realms of Satan’s invisible organization. The Lord will make a clean sweep of the entire wicked thing, and he will use the Greater-than-Jehu, to wit, Christ and his army, to accomplish that purpose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> The temple of Baal stood for the religious part of Satan’s organization. The religions of the Devil, however, were organized and carried on as a means to an end. It was his covetousness for exploiting the human race that led Satan into his gross wickedness, as it is written: “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence. ’ ’ (Ezek. 28:16) It was the covetous spirit of the Devil to make merchandise of the human race that led him to fraud, deception, pillage, murder, and other crimes. His Baal religion served his purpose to alienate mankind from God in order that he might build up his beastly organization on earth, hold the people in ignorance of and away from Jehovah God, and then by the Big Business or commercial schemes rob them of the precious things and, above all, of their devotion to Jehovah. The destruction of the Devil religion will tend to release the people from their blindness, and hence from the satanic power. By his wicked religions Satan got control of the Israelites and made merchandise of the house of God, even as Jesus declared in his day: “And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. ’ ’—John 2:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> Ahab and Jezebel employed the Devil religion of Baal as a means by which they could alienate the Israelites from God and then rob them, even as is illustrated by their stealing the vineyard of Naboth and committing murder in order to get it. The Lord used Jehu to destroy the house of Ahab and Jezebel, and their attaches and adherents, and all the priests and prophets of Baal. Hence it is written: “Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. ’ ’—2 Ki. 10: 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Here the picture of Jehu ends, and he drops entirely out of sight so far as doing anything in the name of Jehovah is concerned, and which foreshadows the greater things to be performed by Christ and his organization. The work of Jehu was a vindication of Jehovah’s name, and that is the purpose of putting the record of his work in the Scriptures. Jehu completed his work which he was commissioned to do, and when he completed it Jehovah commended him: “And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. ’ ’— 2 Ki. 10:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*<sup>3</sup> The work performed by Jehu, which foreshadows the part performed in antitype by the remnant, is that of declaring the judgments of Jehovah. When Jehu had finished his work he reported it, and this is exactly what was done by the man clothed with linen mentioned by Ezekiel: ‘ ‘ And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.”—Ezek. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Let those now who study God’s Word with an honest and sincere desire to understand it, always keep in mind the question at issue and which is of paramount importance, to wit, the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name. Everything else is subservient to that and is important only in that it tends to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Individuals are of no importance whatsoever except as instruments in the hand of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> Elijah the prophet was a witness for Jehovah, and his work foreshadows the testimony work given on earth-during the time that Christ Jesus was preparing the way before Jehovah. His work at Mount Carmel, when he prayed to God to send down fire from heaven, was that the people might know God and turn their hearts to him. That was a vindication work. “Hear me, 0 Lord, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.” (1 Ki. 18:37) Elijah did a destructive work also in the slaying of the prophets of Baal, and thereby pictured the slaying of satanie doctrines of “Christendom” by the promulgation of the truth prior to 1918. Baalism continued in Israel after the taking away of Elijah. Satanic religion continued in “Christendom” after the end of the Elijah work. The Elijah work was important, but Elijah himself was not important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Elisha was anointed to continue the work that Elijah had begun. Elisha did a witness work, which was also a vindication work. His work was not one of restitution. The miracles that God permitted him to perform were manifestly for the purpose of establishing faith of the people in him as God’s prophet and witness. Elisha himself was not important, but his work was important so far as it vindicated Jehovah’s name. The Elisha work of the church is a witness work in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Elisha did no actual bloody work, but he did anoint Jehu to do that very work in his time, and therefore Elisha had a part in it. Elisha survived Jehu, which seems to say that the Elisha work of giving testimony will continue after Armageddon. The Elisha class, being a part of The Christ, the Greater Jehu, have a part in the destructive work of pronouncing and executing judgment upon the enemy organization.—Ps. 149: 7-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>47</sup> Hazael Jehovah directed to be anointed king over Syria. (1 Ki. 19:15) Hazael was not a Jew, but a Syrian. Manifestly he was used by the Lord to do some slaughter work and to inflict punishment upon Israel for their wrongdoing in like manner as the Lord used Nebuchadnezzar. Hazael himself was not important. His work foreshadowed an important work to be done by instruments in the hands of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> Jehu was an Israelite selected by the Lord to do a certain work in his name. Jehu was not important, but his work was important so far as it vindicated God’s name. The antitypical Jehu work is done during the Elisha period of the church, and therefore the class whom Elisha foreshadows has a part in the slaughter or vindication work, not actually, but by way of announcing the judgment and telling of its execution. Jehu was an executioner. (2 Chron. 22: 8) Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great Executioner. (John 5:27) Jehu did his work with haste and without halting. The Lord Jesus does likewise. Jehu executed his commission by destroying the house of Ahab for the following reasons, to wit: The defamation of God’s name by the establishment of Baal worship, by which Ahab and Jezebel carried on their covetous schemes, and which schemes led to the murder of Naboth. This pictures the Devil religions established by him for the defamation of Jehovah’s name and by which he has turned the people away from God, and which led to the murder of Jesus. The destruction of the house of Ahab and Jezebel by Jehu pictures the destruction of Satan and his organization by Christ Jesus, and the turning over of the rulership of the world to Christ. (Rev. 12: 9-11) Those who are faithful unto God, and bring forth the fruits of the kingdom to the end, will share with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. (Matt. 21:43) Jehu and his work of destruction therefore foreshadowed Christ and his army executing judgment upon Satan and his organization, and in which honor all the saints participate. The net result is the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> The fact that Jehovah God is now revealing to his people the meaning of the Jehu picture is proof that the fulfilment thereof is near at hand. These truths now bring comfort and consolation to God’s remnant because they are further assurance of Jehovah’s love and provision for those who love him and who appreciate the fact that the kingdom is begun, and that soon Jehovah’s holy name will be for ever vindicated.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THREE GREAT TESTS OF MAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">H</span><span class="font3">APPY days! Such were the days that the first human couple, Adam and Eve, spent in the time of their innocence in their paradise home in Eden. Perfect in body and mind, in God’s image and likeness, surrounded with all that human senses could enjoy, and especially with a faithful Father and God over them to bless them, our original parents had the possibilities of a blessed eternity of life on this earth set before them. But a villainous enemy brought three great temptations upon them and turned their feet out of the path of eternal life and into the broad road that leads to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But why would God permit a subtle enemy to ensnare this perfect pair, one who would interfere with their happiness? God did not make that creature an enemy. Lucifer was his name, and he was one of the spirit sons of God who had joined together with God’s only-begotten Son the Logos in that wondrous heavenly anthem when the foundation of the earth was laid. He was invisibly in Eden, the garden of the Lord, wherein man dwelt. God had appointed him to the honorable and responsible position of overlord to man, and had assigned him to his duties in the perfect Eden. The Scripture record of this is set forth in Ezekiel’s prophecy, chapter twenty-eight, verses thirteen and fourteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a spirit creature Lucifer was not visible to man, but could employ other means to converse with Adam and his wife. The serpent was a cunning and subtle beast, and at that time walked on legs, as did other beasts. It possessed beauty and grace. Lucifer employed the serpent to attract the attention of Eve, and used it as the medium through which to speak to her. It is manifest from the Scriptures that the animals were able to convey their thoughts to man and to understand man. On this point look up Genesis, chapter two, verse twenty, and chapter three, verses one and two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lucifer knew that God had endowed Adam and Eve with the power of procreation; that is to say, the power of begetting, generating and producing their own kind. He knew that in time they would exercise this function and would bring forth children, and that in due course the earth would be filled with a race of creatures all of whom would be proclaiming the praises of Jehovah God. Lawlessness or iniquity then entered into his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The duties of Lucifer were definitely prescribed by God’s law, but he had a desire to exceed these and to run ahead of God and to do things his own way. He reasoned thus: ‘Why should I not be like the Most High God? He has dominion over all of heaven and earth. I am assigned as overlord of man, earth’s most intelligent creature; and why should not God share with me in all this glory?’ The result of his musing was that he determined to put his desire into action and to establish his own throne in an exalted place and be equal to the Most High God. Isaiah, chapter fourteen, verses thirteen and fourteen, is addressed to Lucifer, and says: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” That marked the time when iniquity entered his heart and was found in him by Jehovah. He became the enemy of God from that minute, and the subtle lurking enemy of man. As man blissfully walked over beautiful Eden he was ignorant of the malicious intent lurking in the mind of Lucifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, Jehovah could have prevented Lucifer from carrying out his wicked scheme, but it did not please him to do so. The perfect creature man must be put to the test, that it might be proved whether he would remain loyal to God or would turn away from God. If he really loved his great Creator and properly appreciated him, then he would withstand all attempts to turn him away from God, and if under this test he proved himself loyal and faithful he would prove himself worthy of the position he occupied, and worthy to possess in time everlasting life. Man must be put to the test, and it was no injustice to him to put him to the test. Jehovah, therefore, permitted Lucifer to go on with his wicked scheme, and permitted man to meet the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God had given his law to Adam before the creation of Eve, his wife. Doubtless Adam had told Eve of this law, because, when the matter was brought to her attention, Eve knew the meaning of the law, and so stated it. Of course, Lucifer knew the law that God had given to man, and he must now take advantage of that law in order to accomplish his wicked purpose. He concluded that it would be easier for him to convince Eve of the correctness of his position than it would Adam; and that with Eve once on his side, the battle would be more than half won, because she would help to induce Adam to join her rather than to be separated from her. Lucifer knew of Adam’s great desire for Eve, and of the influence she exercised over him. Employing the serpent for his purposes Lucifer approached Eve and engaged her in conversation. According to the Scriptures that conversation was in substance thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘This is a beautiful home you have here, with all these trees, wonderful fruits and flowers. You are not eating all the fruit, however. Because God had said that you must not eat of every tree, is that why you are not doing so?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eve replied: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”— Gen. 3:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lucifer’s next step was to convince Eve that he, Lucifer, was her real friend and the friend of her husband; and that God was in fact their enemy, and for selfish reasons was keeping them in ignorance of many wonderful things that they should know. His argument to Eve was that the tree which she had mentioned bore good and wholesome food, that it was even beautiful fruit, and that the fruit was greatly to be desired by anyone who wanted to be wise. So he said to her: “Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”—Gen. 3:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eve yielded to the seductive influence, took the fruit and ate it. Then she showed Adam what she had done, and he also ate of it. This was a violation of God’s plain statement of his law and the acts of both Eve and Adam constituted a willful breaking of that law. From that moment Adam was a bad man, and his wife was also bad. Their conscience smote them and they hid themselves. They had been put to the test; they had yielded to the lawless influence of one who should have taken a different course; and their act had proven themselves disloyal to God, their Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What now must be done to them? Jehovah God is just, which means that he is always right and righteous. To permit his creature to continue in life on earth and to be prince of the earth would be wrong on God’s part, because such a course would make his law of none effect. Besides, if the man surrounded by perfect conditions would disobey God, he would continue to do so under all circumstances and would induce other creatures to be wicked for ever. For man's own good, as well as to uphold the majesty of the law, he must meet the penalty fixed by the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Justice demanded that the law be enforced. Adam and Eve admitted that they had violated God’s law. They both knew that his law stated: “In the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die. ’ ’ God must take some action because of their conduct. His judicial determination or judgment bearing upon the question must be in harmony with his law; hence Jehovah rendered judgment in the case, which judgment is set out in Genesis, chapter three, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life: thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field: in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of God and his judgment prove that God did not create man an immortal soul nor give him an immortal soul. The law had said: “In the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die.’’ (Gen. 2:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> The judgment of God entered against man was in complete and exact harmony with that law. Indeed it could not have been otherwise, because God is always consistent. The judicial determination of God, which is his judgment, reads: ‘Man was made of the dust, and back to the dust he must go.’ (Gen. 3:19) From the earth he had been taken, and to the earth he must ultimately return in the form of inanimate matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus the man Adam and his wife yielded to the three great temptations, namely, “the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,” and the bitter consequences of thus doing came upon them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IS MAN IMMORTAL?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">W</span><span class="font3">HETHER man is immortal and therefore conscious after death has long been a puzzle to many thinking people. What has the Bible to say on the subject ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the Scriptures, immortality resides alone in Jehovah. He is everlasting and from everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah could give to whomsoever he wills the quality of immortality. His Word proves that it is his will to give immortality only to those who have undergone a severe trial and proven their loyalty and faithfulness to him even unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was on earth he said: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:26) This proves that at that time Jesus did not possess immortality. Life within himself, or inherent life, means immortality; and Jesus declared that it was God’s purpose to give him inherent life or life within himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures openly declare that God “only hath immortality”. (1 Tim. 6:16) Because of Jesus’ faithfulness under the most severe test, even to an ignominious death, God raised him up out of death and rewarded him by granting to him the great prize of immortality. Over him death can never again have any power. (Phil. 2: 9-11; 1 Cor. 15: 53; Rev. 1:18) These scriptures prove that Jesus did not possess immortality prior to his resurrection to the divine nature. Jesus the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation. No one was higher. If God did not give his first creature, his great Son the Logos, immortality in the first instance it would be unreasonable that he would make man an immortal creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These emphatic Scriptural statements put to silence the evolution theory of man’s creation. They also conclusively disprove the claim of the clergy that man is part human and part divine. The truth in God’s Word is always harmonious. It states that God made the earth for man and made man for the earth and made man out of the elements of the earth. Being a creature of Jehovah, the first man was perfect, and was given a dominion and made the prince of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are two statements concerning the creation of man made in the Genesis account. The first is a general statement of the fact that God created man in his own image and likeness. The second is the more specific statement as to the manner or method of creation. Both statements are simple, and are exactly in harmony with each other. God made man a creature of the earth and for the earth exclusively and with no promise or prospect of heaven. His nature was that adapted exclusively to the earth. He was made of flesh, blood and bones; and the Scriptures state that flesh, blood and bone are not to be in heaven, or the invisible part of God’s realm.—Luke 24:39; 1 Cor. 15: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man being made in the image and likeness of his Creator, and being perfect, necessarily his attributes or essential qualities of being were justice, wisdom, love and power. He was made an intelligent creature. He knew that to violate God’s law was wrong. The man in Eden was therefore responsible to God. The deliberate violation of God’s expressed will would necessarily call for punishment. To man God had declared his will when he said: ‘In the day that you sin you shall surely die.’ That declaration put man upon trial. The prince of Eden might do anything that would bring him pleasure, but he must not show his disregard for the expressed will of Jehovah. Both the prince and his princess were on trial and they were fully advised in advance what would be the penalty for wrongdoing. Regardless of how much suffering it gave Jehovah to inflict the punishment of death upon this perfect pair, he must do so because his word was at stake. When the infraction of the law was admitted the infliction of the death penalty was the only thing that could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God pronounced that penalty immediately, but deferred the complete enforcement thereof for many years. After pronouncement of the penalty and during the time of its complete enforcement the offspring of the first pair came into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan and his agencies on the earth would make man believe that God sentenced Adam to a lake of fire where he and his offspring must be consciously tormented for ever. God could not have entered such a judgment against man nor inflicted upon man such cruel torture. To have done so would mean that God changed the penalty of his law after the commission of the crime, which would have been unjust. God cannot be unjust, because justice is the foundation of this throne. (Ps. 89:14) No good could possibly have resulted from endless conscious torment. Besides, only a fiend could inflict such cruel punishment. God is love, which is the very opposite of fiend. Satan would have men believe that God is a great monster; and his purpose in such misrepresentation is to turn the minds of men away from God and cause them to abhor him. Furthermore, if the punishment inflicted upon man was and is eternal torment, then man’s reconciliation to God would be absolutely impossible. If man should ever be brought back into full harmony with God, that of itself would completely disprove the eternal torment theory. It seems strange that sensible men could have any difficulty in seeing this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another false theory held out by many professed Christians is that all of the offspring of Adam were involved in the original judgment God entered against Adam and were sentenced to the same punishment that was inflicted upon Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reasoning upon this basis, the conclusion was reached that all must go to eternal torment unless there was some divine intervention in their behalf. But the judgment of God against Adam was not entered against his children. At the time of the judgment against Adam children had not been born and therefore could have had no knowledge of the judgment. It would be inconsistent with Jehovah and his justice to enter a judgment against anyone without his knowledge. Why then have the children of Adam died, and why do they continue to die?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is written in Romans 5, verse fourteen: “Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.’’ Moses marked the time of the giving of the law of God to the Israelites. The transgression of that law meant death to those who were bound by the law. But before that men died even though they had not committed a deliberate sin as did Adam. Why then, if they were not directly involved in the judgment, should the children of Adam die?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The death of Adam’s children was the natural result of Adam’s wrongdoing. The perfect man Adam did not beget children. It was after he was undergoing the sentence of death that he begot his children. Adam was then imperfect and could not beget a perfect offspring. The result was that all his children were born imperfect. God cannot approve an imperfect thing. For this reason the children, being born imperfect, were sinners and under condemnation or disapproval because of sin. They were sinners, not from choice as was Adam, but because they could not avoid it. They were born sinners because their parents were imperfect.—Ps. 51: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be sure, there are degrees of sin among men. There are some who are very greatly depraved and who are a burden to themselves and to their fellow men. There are others who by nature are far above the average in honesty and in purity of thought and action. They are called noble and good among their fellows; but both the greatly depraved man and the one last described are sinners in the sight of God and were born such. Every babe is a sinner by inheritance, as it is stated by the inspired writer of the scripture. (Rom. 5:12) Every sinner or imperfect creature is estranged from God because God cannot approve sin, which is manifest in all imperfect creatures, because sin is a transgression of his law. (Hab. 1:13; 1 John 3:4) No creature could live forever unless that creature had the approval of God, because all right to life proceeds from Jehovah. All the human race being born imperfect because of Adam’s sin, it follows that all the human race must perish unless some provision be made to reconcile the race to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reconciliation of man to God would mean that man must be made right with God and brought into full harmony and peace with the great Creator. Such would mean the justification of man. No man could make provision for justification or reconciliation. No man could by his own efforts make himself right with God. There must be a competent author of reconciliation and provision must be made for the reconciliation of man to God and the terms and provision of reconciliation must be entirely consistent with Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Of What Are the Clergy of the Devil Afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE chain broadcast, June 2G, 1932, “Can the American Government Endure?’’ created more widespread interest than any other public lecture Judge Rutherford has ever given over the radio. The interest continues, and has been heightened in places where some powerful halfpage or quarter-page advertisements have been inserted in the public press, with the judge’s friendly face at the top and quotations from the address underneath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such an advertisement was recently published in the Atlanta </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday American.</span><span class="font6"> It came to the attention of an Alabama philosopher writing under the nom de plume of Umph Floyd. We publish his observations as they appeared in the Clayton County </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News and Farmer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hairlip Junction, Oct. 27, 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The clergy, while claiming to represent God, in fact represent the Devil and his organization. In order that the people might hear the truth and determine this matter for themselves, recently I challenged the combined clergy of America to select their best man to debate this question by radio. Charged with misrepresenting God and serving Satan, these gentlemen should either come forward and prove the falsity of the charge or, failing in that, should cease to hold themselves out as teachers of the Word of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing is a quotation in part of a paragraph from a challenge of Judge Kutherford directed at the clergy of America, taken fiom a double column advertisement appearing in a recent issue of the Atlanta </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am not bold enough to subscribe myself as entirely partisan with the views of Judge Rutherford, nor do 1 endorse him fully as a teacher of the Bible. However, he is a learned Bible student, and since 1 believe he has some grounds for his assertion, I have quoted his expression on the subject ot the clergy as a preface to some of the things I am about to say, and as an indication that I am not alone in my belief that in some respects the modern ministry is weakening as a force in the advancement of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before giving utterance to what I have to say personally on the subject, I wish to ask if it is not rather questionable that the clergy fails to take note of Judge Rutherford’s challenge! As a rule the clergy is rather sensitive to a challenge of any sort, and if it is not a vital question of truth in its relation to the failure of the clergy, will fill columns of the newspapers with the ministerial views to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But is it not now noticeable that the Protestant clergy is diligent in overlooking some of the vital and fundamental issues in life, religion and politics, not daring to express themselves openly and forcibly for or against such issues! Of course, such is entirely true and is a matter of question to thinking people who in a measure adhere to principles of life and religion that cannot be changed even by the ravages of time. The clergy, then, must be building for numerical, commercial and social success, which according to my views is not the purpose of God’s church on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question of companionate marriage is one proof of this contention. Can you name one Protestant member of the clergy, prominent in church councils of the world, who has made in a realistic way the columns of our newspapers in denunciation of this real menace to our social and religious structure! You cannot. It has not been done. True, Bishop Manning of the Episcopal faith achieved through no efforts of his own certain newspaper notoriety, but as a factor in the repudiation of this ‘ ‘ nigger ’ ’ form of marriage, the Episcopal bishop has failed as signally as the bishops of the great Methodist church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps it is the view of the Protestant clergy that this question is not of moment in the affairs of life, though to the best of our knowledge and belief the nuptial bans of today are approximately the same as was witnessed by Christ when He converted water into wine, and are representative of the form of marriage union to which we are glad to ascribe our parentage. The question evidently seemed of sufficient importance to the pope of Rome, one great plenipotentiary of the religious world who had less cause of concern than those of our faiths, to raise his voice in denunciation of the evil, and to his everlasting credit his “plaint” earned around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently, on a night train operated between Atlanta and Savannah, I was a witness of what I term the repugnant scene of several beautiful young women, sitting in the embrace of an equal number of young men, in the smoking compartment of the car, all of them smoking cigarettes with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">utter </span><span class="font4">abandon. In all probability all of these young women were members of the best families in the land, and there is hardly any doubt all of them were members of the church in their home communities. I cast no particular reflection on their parents. Perhaps that scene, could the parents of the young women have witnessed it, would have been just as revolting and repugnant to them as it was to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps our Protestant clergy will excuse the situation by charging it to the spirit of Young America. But you will admit that one indiscretion generally leads to another and others. Is it not a sad thought to some of us that some of the modesty that marked the conduct of our generation, that of our fathers and mothers, is to such a large extent lacking in the conduct of the boys and girls of today! Can you name a member of the clergy of the present day who has made an issue of this trend of morals in the rising generation, preaching and teaching against a laxity in social intercourse that will inevitably lead to—we hardly know what!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bring the question home to a member of the clergy, if you will! What will be the quick retort! The blame will be laid entirely at the doors of the parents. No doubt in many in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">stances the blame will be correctly placed. But even then, is that an excuse for the clergy I Parents of this day and time are as much in need of example and guidance as are their children. No, the clergy accepts no blame for anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again, it is common for the members of the profession to profess ignorance of the fact of dereliction of individual members of their pastorates, and the members of the church roam the pastures of certain forbidden fields through the week days, and sit in sainted reverence under the noses of their beloved “pastures” on Sunday, never hear a word of condemnation aimed at the evil practices they enjoy outside of the church, and, when they die, are the recipients of funerals of par excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, I wouldn’t say the “pasture” should be the judge of the destiny of such ones in the church. I would not deny anyone the privilege of union with the church. When a person takes the vows of the church he is then responsible to God for what he does. But I do say that the clergy is remiss in the condemnation of evils that it must be aware are practiced by members of the church. It is no use to plead ignorance. Flagrant violations of the code of churchly ethics are assuredly known to the clergy ever and anon. So long as such conduct is overlooked and condoned by the clergy, so long will moral decrepitude grow. By and by to the casual eye the wool of the goat will be just as long and shaggy as is that of the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ignorance is no excuse. Too much ignorance is the plea. It hides a multitude of short-comings and long-goings. As I have said before, I am not sympathetic with the husband whose wife cherishes more sweethearts than she did in the days of her maidenhood, for it is a solemn fact that the husband in such a case cannot be kept constantly in the dark of the moon. He simply condones the practice. Such is true in a relative sense of the clergy and many of the evils of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">False doctrines, or deceptive version of facts, contribute to the confusion prevalent today. It is so easy to asciibe an erroneous reason for this and that. It is being done by those high in authority in church circles; anything to draw attention from the core of tho trouble. Too bad when our church leaders resort to subterfuge to make a smoke-screen to hide behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t say it isn’t sol It is. One of the bishops of the great Methodist church, speaking recently before a convention of the W.C.T.U., in Bessemer, Alabama, informed his audience that the South had been betrayed by its politicians, meaning by that, as you can sec, that the trend in the political world towards a revocation of the prohibition law was a visitation of evil on our heads, brought at the instance of our politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a shame to so misrepresent facts! The people, most of whom are church members, are responsible for this trend. Is it not evidenced by the fact that candidates running recently on a dry platform were defeated foi election? Is it possible that only “wet” politicians voted in these elections? If you believe the reverend bishop such will be the only logical conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This groat bishop of the Methodist church said the dry laws had not been a failure, and that during his early travels, averaging more than thirty thousand miles in various sections of the country, he had seen only two intoxicated persons. Incredible, if true! Impossible to my way of thinking. He must have been blind in one eye and couldn't see out of the other, Seeing those two intoxicated men only in his vivid imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I would like to say to the great divine, and if L ever meet him, I will do so, that if he will go to any leading hotel in any city of impoitanee, on any gala night in the year, such as New Year’s Eve, Thanksgiving Eve, Christmas Eve, and even on an occasional Saturday night, hotels given to promotion of formal and informal dances, he’ll see more “drunks” and have to travel considerably less. Yea, and the pity of it is, he’ll see girls and women numbered in the inebriated—something rarely seen in pre-prohibition days, and something against which I don’t believe he has ever raised his voice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the olden days, and some of us are old enough to remember back to them, the clergy expected something of us—quite a whole lot. We could not dance and not face the tribunal of the church. We were expected to conform to the standards of perfection prescribed by the ritual of the church in so far as humanly possible. We could not fight and brawl without giving an account of it to our elders, and promising to do better in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The condition should be reversed. In a measure it is. The time has come when we have a right to expect more of the clergy, more of prayer, more of consecrated religion, less of pretense, more of the gospel of Christ. Verily, 1 believe the time has come when we should tell the clergy how to pi each to us—if we would in truth worship the God of our fathers as did our fathers, and not join Aaron and Ills host at the foot of the mountain and worship brazen calves.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Let Them Defend Their Position</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing is pretty good for an honest backwoods philosopher, writing in a country paper, but it does not tell half of the story, and, of course, does not pretend to. The hypocrisy of the Devil’s clergy is the history of the human family from Cain to the present crowd, and from the murder of Abel to the grabbing of Manchuria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here they are, backed into a corner by a lawyer that knows who they are and who they represent, and they think to get out of their dilemma by keeping still. But can they do it? Judge Rutherford challenges these preachers to defend their position. He insists that they represent the Devil, while all the time they claim to represent Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What are the judge’s motives? Is he working for the good name and fame of Jehovah God or working for the Devil? If the clergy can prove that the judge is working for the Devil, let them come forth and do so. But they must act; they dare not let a challenge like this go unanswered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first defense of the clergy will be that on account of their divided condition they cannot be held responsible for the acts of one another; but that is not the truth, as we will show. We know, as all may know, that in our day we do have 9 kinds of Presbyterians, 18 kinds of Baptists, 19 kinds of Methodists, and 22 kinds of Lutherans, all together some 213 varieties of the Devil’s religion; but there is a common tie that holds all these together, and that is the loyalty that the clergy of all these denominations have to their father, the Devil, whose they are and whom they serve. Bear with us while we sketch a few, just a few, of the thousands of places where they have touched the pages of history and left their record behind them, so that all who run may read, and all who read may run.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>The Devil's Clergy in Old Testament Times</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, it is not necessary to believe that they boldly announced that they were the servants of the evil one. Possibly they did not know it, though as a matter of fact they were; but our present point is that they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worked together</span><span class="font6"> in opposing the servant of Jehovah God and in resisting the truth in the presence of Pharaoh. In this they revealed their likeness to the clergy of the Devil of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was of them that Isaiah prophesied: “His watchmen are blind; they are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> ignorant, they are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> look to their own way, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every one</span><span class="font6"> for his gain from his quarter.” (Isa. 56:10,11) This scripture shows that, despite all differences, the clergy of the Devil have things in common and can and do work for their common ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This unity of the Devil’s clergy is very plainly brought out by the prophet Jeremiah: “From the prophet even unto the priest every one deal-eth falsely. For the pastors are become brutish. Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard. My people hath been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray.” (Jer. 6:13; 10: 21; 12:10; 50: 6) In these and many kindred passages we see how clearly evident it is that theological differences do not hinder the clergy of the Devil from acting in accord. All they need is a sufficient incentive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A conspiracy is a meeting of the minds, and when Ezekiel says of the Devil’s ministers, “There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof . . . ; they have devoured souls. Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things” (Ezek. 22:25,26), he shows that they can get along together when they try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same prophet carries this picture of unity in the Devil’s priesthood still further when he says: “Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.”—Ezek. 34: 3,4.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>They Cooperated Beautifully</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">As we examine the history handed down to us in the writings of Daniel the prophet we are at once struck with the thoroughgoing way in which the Devil’s clergy cooperated in their efforts to get rid of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, and even of Daniel himself. It cannot be charged against them that they did not work together. And that is the immediate point we are ■wishing to establish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Divisions count for little when one can find such practical unity as that of which the prophet Hosea writes: “As troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent.” (Hos. 6:9) Now if there w’ere differences of opinion among them that stood in the way of their robberies and murder, no doubt Hosea would have indicated this in some manner. People should not be charged with weakness or shortcomings they do not possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zephaniah seems to note the same unity when he says of the Devil’s clergy that “her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law”. (Zeph. 3:4) There is no hint here that these men pursued antagonistic courses. They all seem to have been able to work together in the thing they had in hand.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>They Gladly Joined in Killing the Lord</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, our Savior, went much into detail about the work of the clergy. Isn’t it an excellent description where He says of them that they “come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves”? (Matt. 7:15) “They bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.” “Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” (Matt. 23: 4,13) There is no unseemly friction here indicated. They all seem to get along quite well in the things they do and wish to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In due time they got together and killed the Lord. It would be hard to get a priest out of bed at any other time, but when they had fixed it up with Judas to put Him to death, they had no trouble in arranging an illegal Shanghai night court; and all were present. No doubt every one of them was present also a little later when Caiaphas adroitly put it up to Pilate that unless he did something with the prisoner at the bar he was not likely to keep his job. The insinnation “Thou art not Caesar’s friend” was enough to break down Pilate’s weak resistance to the demands of the priests and their friends, “Release unto us Barabbas.” Quite likely all the priests were present at the crucifixion, mocking the One who died “the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unity in the Dark Ages</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not need to dilate upon the unity of the Devil’s church throughout the long era that is justly designated as the Dark Ages, for it is a matter of common knowledge. It flowered in a natural way in St. Bartholomew’s massacre and in the Spanish Inquisition. It confined its persons to be questioned in dungeons 35 feet under ground and brought them forth for periodical torture by rack and thumbscrew. Some few gained death by deep inhalations of the mephitic gas emanated from their own excrement, while the less fortunate were torn apart with pincers, applied to the most sensitive parts of the body, or had molten lead or excrement poured into the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. There was no discord among the Devil’s clergy; they acted as a unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil's clergy of today are the claimed and the actual successors of those who built and still maintain at Rome a palace containing 11,005 rooms, surrounded by every luxury that money can buy, wherein a man, one of whose predecessors raped 300 nuns, allows those who wish to do so to kiss his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He maintains a cash deposit in the Bank of England of 250,000,000 francs, a battalion of 150 picked guards, and 122 batteries of artillery, Gatling guns and munitions, in the name of the Prince of Peace. Thirty-seven witnesses found one of these men, John XXIII, guilty of adultery, incest, sodomy, robbery and murder. Many others were as bad. The Devil’s clergy<sup>7</sup> sees no harm in such matters unless discovery takes place, when it is usually necessary to transfer the “father” to some other diocese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who will deny’ the unity of the Devil’s church in Mexico? It has done every illicit thing from openly conducting raffles for souls, in which those that won the lottery got the souls of their fathers and mothers out of purgatory (?), to secretly planning and executing the murder of President Obregon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unity of the Devil’s Clergy for War</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When an opportunity presents itself for the wholesale murder of their fellow men, the Devil’s clergy show a unity of action that is noteworthy; and they are not slow about it either. Thus, as soon as the Big Business crowd had decided to make the world safe for France’s payment of the interest on the bonds held by Morgan, by plunging the United States into war, the Government summoned 300 preachers to Washington to consider how the message of hate could best be spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Massachusetts Clerical Association was one of the first to respond. The way in which they rose to the occasion was wonderful. F. P. Crozier, in his book entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Brass Hat in No Man’s Land,</span><span class="font6"> said that “the Christian churches are the finest blood-lust creators we have, and of them we made free use”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in 1918 a convention of clergymen was held at Philadelphia, at which a resolution was passed calling upon Congress to provide that alleged violations of the Espionage Law should be tried by court-martial, and death inflicted as a penalty. General Bell, of the United States army, made the statement that the purpose and intention of this proposed law was to punish the president (J. F. Rutherford) of the International Bible Students Association by putting him to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The discord was so little as to be unworthy of mention. Thus, a clergyman, writing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font6"> of March 6, 1920, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The record of the war activities of the churches, while very<sup>7</sup> ample, is simple. Practically every pulpit in the land was a source of patriotic inspiration. Every clergynnan labored day and night fostering the morale of the army and the people. At home the clergy preached atrocities, and in the camps they fired the soldiers with a holy zeal to attack and kill the enemy. Briefly, the record shows that both here and abroad each of the ordained spokesmen of Christianity justified and consecrated the action of his own people in resorting to arms. [Pages of this, if necessary.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lloyd George’s words were: “The churches were to blame for the last war; not monarchs, rulers, militarists, but the churches. Had all the churches cried halt, this awful murder could not have gone on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If another World War should emerge, the Devil’s clergy would be right there with their loyalty to their father and master, as they have ever been. The news dispatches show the Italian cardinals blessing the Italian fleet, and the British bishops blessing British battleships. Within the week in which this was written, one of the Roman Catholic vice-presidents of the Anti-Saloon League wrote and telegraphed President Hoover urging that he plunge the United States into a war with Japan. Experience has taught him that in a world war the clergy make good money; the times are hard now, collections are slow, and he misses the big pile he raked off in 1917-1919.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Unity of the Devil’s Clergy for Peace</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Somebody will compare this headline with the last one and say, “There must be some mistake here: the clergy could not be a unit for war and also a unit for peace.” But that is where you are wrong, good friend. The facts are that in time of war the Devil’s clergy are for war and in time of peace they are for peace. They wish at all times to do their father’s will.—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In January, 1919, the Federal Council of Churches said: “The time has come to organize the world for truth, justice, and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a League is not merely a peace expedient, it is rather the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is ‘peace on earth, good will toward men’. Like the gospel, its appeal is universal. The heroic dead will have died in vain unless out of victory shall come ‘a new heaven and earth wherein dwelleth righteousness’. (2 Pet. 3:13) The church can give a spirit of good will without which no League of Nations can endure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the League of Nations treaty was up before the Senate for discussion a memorial was presented to that body, signed by 13,583 clergymen scattered among the different denominations as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The memorial reads as follows: “We, the undersigned clergymen, urge the Senate of the United States to ratify the Paris peace treaty embodying the League of Nations covenant at the earliest possible date, without amendment or such reservations as would require resubmission of the treaty to the peace conference and Germany.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since that time the Federal Council of Churches, which has an annual budget of about $1,000,000, has insisted that it has 20,000,000 church members that are demanding entrance of the United States into the League of Nations. It is claimed for this Federal Council that its final objective is a United States church with power to deal with all political and economic questions, even to the tariff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As many as 180,182 persons appended their names to a petition that the Kellogg Peace Pact be promptly ratified by the Senate. The petition was handed to President Coolidge by Bishop McConnell and two doctors of divinity in behalf of the Federal Council of Churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The big councils are made up of little councils. Thus it happens that the Kansas City Council of Churches, all the officers of which were for war when the country was at war, is out with a proclamation that ever since the governments of the world united in signing the Paris Peace Pact peacemakers are patriotic. In other words, when Big Business is for war it is patriotic to be for war; when it is for peace, it is patriotic to be for peace.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Unity of the Devil’s Clergy for “Prohibition”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ first miracle was to turn water into wine. If He did that in the United States today they would lock Him up. If you ask ■who would lock Him up, the answer would be, The same class that accused Him of being a wine-bibber, though they themselves really enjoy making use on their own tables or in their own cellars of what is left over from the communion wine, and usually some more besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not denied that the Anti-Saloon League has collected $67,565,313 for political purposes, nor that 1,360 persons have been slain in a vain attempt to enforce prohibition. Nor is it denied that the president of the League is a bishop; four of the vice-presidents are bishops; the chairman of the national executive committee is a D.D.; and there are bishops or “reverends” in 11 of the 15 districts into which the country is divided. The national board of directors has clergymen as directors in 40 of the 48 states of the Union; and 31 of the state superintendents are clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Brooklyn was considered unduly damp it was the Devil’s clergy of the city who sent a request to Washington that the number of the dry agents in the city be increased from 12 to 100. Bishop James Cannon, noted for his high standing in the League, and his extraordinary bucket shop operations with trust funds, stands so high that he flatly refused to answer questions put to him by the Senate investigating committee. Harry Sinclair, multimillionaire, was locked up for similar disobedience, but the Devil’s governments stand more or less in awe of the Devil’s clergy and Cannon was but gently reprimanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Political Unity of the Devil’s Clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is splendid political unity among the Devil’s clergy; not absolute, of course, but practical. Thus, on a recent occasion, the Federal Council of churches appealed “to the churches of the United States to join with men of prayer in this and other lands in united intercession to God on the Sabbath day preceding the opening of what may, under His blessing, be an epoch-making conference”. (The Armament Conference, which spent six months accomplishing exactly nothing at all.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Said Reverend Robert Cummins in the Cincinnati </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer,</span><span class="font6"> and there can be no doubt he wrote out of a full heart:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us not underestimate the influence of the Christian church in the United States. Its influence upon governmental policies is equal to the power of European Catholicism of an earlier day, though it is the power of influence and not of authority. In the final determination of the problem of another war, the voice of the United States is supreme. The Christian church can control the voice of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Philadelphia, on October 10, 1932, 100 members of the Presbyterian Ministers’ Social Union applauded Judge Harry S. McDevitt when he proposed that a whipping post be set up in the center of the city hall courtyard as a cure for crime. The sympathies of the Devil’s clergy are with torturers, always. They believe in torture, preach it when they dare, and would love to practice it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Methodist Episcopal Church State Department Building at Washington cost $750,000. The duties of those at headquarters are to communicate regularly with the 20,000 Methodist ministers, and tell them when to put the screws on the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Industrial Unity of the Devil’s Clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Federal Council of Churches in its public proclamation of a day of prayer for the week beginning October 2,1932, sets forth the general principles that have actuated and do actuate the Devil’s clergy, and the principals of their flock, in the following admission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have worshiped at the shrines of false gods— the false god of mammon, money, things; the false god of production, bigness; the false god of nationalism, individualism, social injustices; the false god of pleasure, amusement, disregard for things and times sacred; the false god of success, high living, careless thinking; the false god of magic, reaping where we had not sowed, profiting where we had not toiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no record that just before he was hanged Haman admitted his guilt, nevertheless all must acknowledge that it would have been the decent thing for him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By those that know, and even by some of their own number, it is freely admitted that the clergy have had and to some little extent still do have their place in industrial affairs. Their business is to say nothing, and to say it pleasantly. Their job is evasion, through platitudes and generalities, of the essentials of truth, and to line their congregations up on the side of things as they are, instead of as they ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Gastonia, N. C., in the recent struggle of the poor cotton workers for a living wage, it was found impossible to get a minister to preach a burial sermon for murdered strikers. It is freely admitted in North Carolina that the mill owners pay the clergy wages and that they are their “moral police”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Detroit YMCA withdrew an invitation to the president of the American Federation of Labor, to speak, openly admitting fear that unless they did so their $5,000,000 building program would be jeopardized. As an annex to the clergy business, they know on which side their bread is buttered, and where the butter comes from, and how it is to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Church and Drama Association, financed by the big film companies, and with Bishop Manning and Cardinal S. Parkes Cadman as its overstaffed prophets, was a big success until the film men got tired of coughing up, when it suddenly became an international laughing stock.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Multifarious Unity of the Devil’s Clergy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Time would fail to tell of the multifarious ways in which the Devil’s clergy have shown their ability to get together, especially when they saw anything in it for themselves, either directly or indirectly. Thus, after the Queens clergy had met in the chamber of commerce building and resolved not to conduct any more Sunday funerals, because it interfered with their regular business, it was not long before ministerial associations all over the country were engaged in a similar campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Cleveland Methodist Ministerial Association wanted the sheriff of the county removed from office because he used the Sunday collections of the race track, amounting to $9,347, for the relief of the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In November, 1931, the Chattanooga Pastor’s Association met to consider the formation of a domestic loan company, which planned to charge an interest rate of 8 percent, or, in other words, usury, and extortionate usury at that, though in Tennessee permitted by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A group of 102 American clergymen sent a message to Ramsay MacDonald telling him how to run India; a similar group scolded the American Legion because Christ is not mentioned in the Legion’s written prayers; the Episcopalians have solemnly considered how many children a man may have, i.e., birth control, and the Universal Christian Council for Life and Work, Geneva, Switzerland, which is a sort of religious annex of the League of Nations, and which has the archbishop of Canterbury for its British president, and S. Parkes Cadman for its American president, has undertaken to make over our calendar for us.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Religious Unity of the Devil’s Clergy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">No! It is not a mistake. In spite of all their differences, there is an essential unity in the ranks of the Devil’s clergy, and we shall show something of what this unity is. One may see it in practical form in the quarterly Prayer Bulletin of the World Dominion Movement, wherein it is revealed that requests for prayer for success of the movement should arrive not later than the 15th of February, May, August and November of each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A partial list of the societies with which this World Dominion Movement is working cooperatively includes the China Inland Mission, Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, Baptist Missionary Society, Primitive Methodist Missionary Society, Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society, Church Missionary Society, British and Foreign Bible Society, Religious Tract Society, Japan Evangelistic Band, Central Japan Pioneer Mission, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Chinese Foreign Missionary Union, Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, Episcopal Church of America, Regions Beyond Missionary Union, Poona and Indian Village Mission, Ceylon and India General Mission, Church of England Zenana Missionary Society, Northeast India General Mission, Central Asian Mission, Eastern Himalayan Mission, Church of Scotland, Southern Morocco Mission, Kansas Gospel Mission, North Africa Mission, South Africa General Mission, Zambesi Industrial Mission, Sudan Interior Mission, West Africa Mission of the Presbyterian Church, Sudan United Mission, Evangelical Movement of Russian Youths, Spanish Gospel Mission, Salvation Army, Church Mission to Jews, Mildmay Mission to Jews, Inland South America Missionary Union, Irish Baptist Foreign Mission, South American Missionary Society, Moravians, Colonial and Continental Church Society, American Bible Society, Loudon Missionary Society, Association for Free Distribution of the Scriptures, Irish Presbyterian Mission, Egypt General Mission, Algiers Mission Band, Dutch Reformed Church, Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, United Lutheran Church, Africa Inland Mission, National Bible Society of Scotland, International Hebrew Christian Alliance, Evangelical Union of South America, Scripture Gift Mission, Methodist Episcopal Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World Dominion Movement seems to be a sort of successor of the Interchurch World Movement, which purposed to raise $1,500,000,000 to convert the whole world to something or other in a single generation. Over $100,000,000 of this amount was raised, and used largely in paying the salaries of the men who raised it, together with office rent, clerk hire and huge traveling expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Federal Council of Churches of America and the Greater New York Federation of Churches are, in a general way, supposed to do for the United States, and for Greater New York, what the World Dominion Movement does for the rest of the world. It has been granted radio facilities estimated as worth $1,000,000 a year, all free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Sunday School Association is a worldwide thing, as are also the YMCA, Salvation Army, etc. In July, 1932, 1,500 Sunday school officials from 50 countries met in Brazil (and the country has been in the throes of revolution ever since).</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Unity of the Devil’s Clergy Against the Truth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Having never had any real interest in the Scriptures, except as a convenient means of making themselves appear wiser than others, by claiming to be the only ones on earth who can understand them, the Devil’s clergy have always manifested marked antagonism toward those that have tried to understand the Bible themselves or to teach their understanding to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an earlier day this carried Huss, Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley to the stake; in 1918 there occurred in the United States more than 100 instances of killings or attempted killings of men and women whose only offense was that they believed the Scriptures and sought to help others to do so. In most of these cases the mobs were started by the clergy; as usual, they used or sought to use the police to do their dirty work for them. For full details see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">No. 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the same year the clergy, first of Canada, and then of the United States, united to put Judge Rutherford and his friends in prison. They hoped and expected we would die there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These men consider Dean Inge, of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, one of themselves, worthy of their highest honors. He recently said: “The fits of divine inspiration in which the Apostle Paul received revelations from above were nothing more than epileptic fits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But because Judge Rutherford believes the Bible, and has helped millions of others to do likewise, these men have done all possible to interfere with the work which God has given to him to do, because of his faithfulness, and which God will not permit them to do, because of their unfaithfulness to anybody except their father, the Devil.—John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago the Roman Catholic church in Canada had enough Protestant church backing to close the I.B.S.A. radio stations there, despite the fact that 458,026 persons sent to Ottawa a protest against closing the same; 82,468 of which protesters were owners of radio sets at the time of protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">July 22, 1927, 26,000 licensed holders resident in Scotland petitioned the British Broadcasting Company for permission to hear Judge Rutherford’s lecture at Toronto, but the Northern Area Religious Advisory Council of the clergy of the Devil, composed of officials of the Church of Scotland, the United Free Church in Scotland, and the Episcopal Church in Scotland, succeeded in keeping the address off the air in Scotland on the day of delivery in Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholics were right behind their Protestant confreres; behind in both senses. On August 24,1927, the National Council of Catholic Men, Washington, D. C., ordered by telegraph two copies of the foregoing address, intended for scrutiny at a convention of Catholic societies held in Detroit four days later. They hoped to find something they could use to stop the promulgation of the truth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Always the Same, Everywhere</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever we go with Judge Rutherford’s books we meet the opposition of the clergy of the Devil. To start with, we find the people listening to his lectures, and enjoying them. We place many books. The clergy of the Devil become aroused; they start all kinds of lies, doing everything possible to prevent the truth from coming to the attention of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> common thing for them to have Jehovah's witnesses arrested, in places where they have the influence to do so. Scores of such instances have been mentioned in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age:</span><span class="font6"> Bergenfield, South Amboy, Asbury Park, Westfield, Summit, Rockville, Bethlehem, Glassport, recently. Book-burnings have been arranged where that was possible, as at Turkey Neck Bend, Ky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the latter state, in the fall of 1931, when a lady approached a Baptist clergyman in a pleasant and respectful manner, and sought to present him with a free copy of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font6"> he grabbed it from her hand and threw it violently into her face. We do not mention this conduct as anything especially unusual; we find these clergy the least kind, the least noble, the least manly of any persons we meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In numerous instances the clergy of the Devil, as at Neapolis, Greece, have organized comitad-jis, or associations of assassins, to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. In America it is the custom to do such work by such police as are under their control, and some police are thus controlled.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Now What Do These Men Fear?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Now we have shown clearly, we believe, the great pow<sup>r</sup>er and the essential unity of the clergy of the Devil. We have traced their history from the days of their opposition to Moses down through Old Testament and New Testament days to their murder of the Lord himself. We have seen how they stood man to man, or devil to devil, at the time of the Inquisition. We have noted their essential unity for war in time of war and for peace in time of peace. We have observed their work for “prohibition”, and have seen their political unity, their industrial unity, and unity along many other lines, including their religious unity. And finally we have observed their unity against the truth. They have no particular trouble in getting together for any objective they have in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now here is the crux of the matter. There are in the United States many millions of people who would like to hear a debate between Judge Rutherford and the best man the combined clergy of the Devil of America or of the world can select, as to whether or not these men, while claiming to represent God, in fact represent the Devil and his organization. Thousands of our readers have written in requesting and even demanding such a debate. The judge is ready, and waiting. Now what is holding up the other side? Are they afraid? And the answer is that they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of what are they afraid?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And the answer is that thev are afraid of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">THE TRUTH. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For, in their hearts, the clergy of the Devil know full well that they are just what the judge will prove them to be, if they give him the chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But it is not at all likely they will give him the chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women.” '—Jer. ol: 30.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">this is announced by a gentleman, who calls himself a judge. Who he is or what he is or where he is, his big display advertisement doesn’t tell, but lie has everything down to a fine point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As he sees things, Big Business is Satan’s own deputy on earth and has brought things to such a pass that the world is about to go up in flame and smoke. The American government is going to be swept aside like a house of cards. Big Business got us into the World War and then seized all the world’s wealth and brought on the depression. None of tho clergy is any better than he ought to be, in fact, says the judge, none of them is quite as good as he ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the tasks of the Christian is in meekness to instruct those that oppose themselves. There is always a chance that they are honest and sincere, and therefore their arguments should be met with honesty and sincerity, and as much of courtesy as is possible under the circumstances. It is for this reason that we notice the above. We do not know that it was written or inspired by some preacher, but we believe it to have so been. Few editors are as discourteous as this when writing of their own volition, and the concluding sentences indicate that the clergy probably had a hand. But, in any event, we handle it on its merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely Jehovah God could not be charged with all the wickedness in the earth. Is it, for example, His fault that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is cruelly overloaded with</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(N. Mex.) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">■Journal']</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This sort of stuff will make a great appeal to a lot of folks. It is a pity that there is no way to prevent a man spouting in that fashion. Of course, intelligent, educated folk know better and look upon the mouthings of this judge as twaddle. But maybe it is better to let him get it off Iris chest than undertake to suppress him. If you try to restrain him, he will declare that you are one of the devil’s own minions and thus make more of a fuss than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is too bad, however, that such stuff should be sent forth right at this time when there is more of a demand than ever for sound thinking and calm judgment. This raving, raging and frothing judge can upset the minds of many people. Of course, tire American government is not going to collapse. Of course, Big Business did not get us into the war nor seize all the wealth. Of course, the elergy is not as this judge says they are. lie knows better but he wouldn’t get a hearing without saying something that would shock the feeble-minded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">high-salaried men whose business it is to loan the people’s money, and that these men loaned $80,000,000 to the one bank of Charles G. Dawes, of Chicago, and refused to loan $10,000,000 to the great state of Pennsylvania in which tens of thousands of families are now living on $2 a week or less?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it His fault that, as late as October 1, and possibly even yet, hundreds of men were sleeping in the open in Pittsburgh, in doorways, and on the river bank, with nothing under them but newspapers, and nothing over them but newspapers, in one of the wealthiest cities in the world, a city in which America’s leading distiller, and one time secretary of the treasury, but now ambassador to the Court of St. James, was at the time erecting a $3,000,000 church in honor of the Nazarene that had not where to lay His head? The editor saw these men with his own eyes; you have to see a thing like this to really appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it God’s fault that the Big Business crowd have ruined thousands of small banks all over the United States by loading them up with worthless European and South American bonds, and that now we have in America 11,000,000 unemployed, and in one state, Mississippi, onefourth of all the farm lands have been sold to meet unpaid taxes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it God’s fault that cotton, wheat and other staples are selling far below the cost of production, or that engineers who have studied the application of machinery to human labor have declared that in another two years 45,000,000 people in this country will inevitably he receiving public relief because there can be no jobs for the family breadwinners?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely Mr. Pickrell, the editor of the Albuquerque </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font6"> would not hold that Jehovah God is responsible for all the church denominations and the things they teach. Notice what the Federal Churches of America have to say on this subject. Where such admissions as these are publicly and truthfully made, there is nothing to be gained by denying the facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have worshiped at the shrines of false gods: the false god of mammon, money, things; the false god of production, bigness; the false god of nationalism, individualism, social injustices; the false god of pleasure, amusement, disregard for things and times sacred; the false god of success, high living, careless thinking; the false god of magic, reaping where we had not sowed, profiting where we had not toiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps Mr. Pickrell is a Lutheran. If so, let him note what Rev. Dr. Frederick II. Knubel, president of the United Lutheran church in America, has to say of conditions in the ecclesiastical organization over which he presides. Surely God is not to blame for this condition, any more than He is for the fact that since 1900 30,000 Protestant churches have closed their doors and thousands more are more nearly dead than alive. Said Dr. Knubel:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United Lutheran church in America was born amid the frenzy of Armistice Day in 1918. Since then the world has lived constantlj<sup>7</sup> in some form of feverish excitement. The world has not sobered in the least, for its frenzy is now revealed in dazed bewilderment. Riches have flown and financiers have been found as fools. The bigness of material things and the bigness of man continue to control even in the depression. Has the world thought of God? It is more than a century since such a flood of atheism as is seen today has swept all nations. In all this the church has mimicked the world, in excitement, in huge undertakings for quick advance, in calls for great leaders, and, above all, in neglect of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Louisiana clergyman speaking recently over radio station KWKH is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there ever was a time for us to preach the truth ■without fear of hell, it is now. The life of our people is at stake. Our Sunday school teachers are starving. Our little children have empty stomachs. Our business men are losing their homes. Our lawyers and doctors face actual distress. Our farmers have no seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since there are but the two masters, Jehovah God and the Devil, and since neither Mr. Pickrell nor even the church people themselves can or do subscribe to such conditions as we have above mentioned, who is it that the present disorder represents? Manifestly, it must be the one that took Jesus up into a mountain and showed Him all the governments of the world in a moment of time and claimed control over them, and of whom it is written that “the whole world lieth in the wicked one”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There cannot be the least doubt that the world is promised a righteous government. “He mak-eth wars to cease unto the end of the earth.” (Ps. 46: 9) “O let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.” (Ps. 67:4) “AH kings shall fall down before him; all nations shall serve him.” (Ps. 72:11) “He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.” (Ps. 96:13) “With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with, equity.” (Ps. 98:9) “He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isa. 2:4) “The government shall be upon his shoulder.” (Isa. 9: 6) “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Dan. 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We could multiply these quotations indefinitely. To Judge Rutherford, and to all others who love the Scriptures, these texts mean what they say. Plainly, an unrighteous government under the Devil could not exist when Jehovah’s gov-eminent is in complete control; therefore all unrighteous governments must perish from the earth, and every honest person desires to see this very thing come to pass, and was taught to pray for it by the Redeemer himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We conclude by helping Editor Pickrell a little respecting Judge Rutherford, so he will know him better, when this thing comes up again. The Lord is using the judge. We know this because more than 130,000,000 of his books are in circulation. The population of Albuquerque is 26,570; we do not know, at the moment, how many of the judge’s books are in the homes of these people, but we do know that the first visiting of Wayne county, Pennsylvania, population 27,435, resulted in placing 11,646, or certainly more than two in every home, and if anything like 11,000 of Judge Rutherford’s books are in circulation in Albuquerque, then Editor Pickrell is most unwise to have written as he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We add another word. The judge’s radio lectures are now broadcast regularly on upward of 350 stations a week, not overlooking KGGM in Editor Pickrell’s home town, Albuquerque, where they may be heard every Sunday at 12: 45 p.m., and every Thursday at 8:15 p.m. Tune in, Fellow Scribe, and get in touch with the most optimistic and uplifting work now in progress in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Don’t be downcast because Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore &amp;&nbsp;Ohio Railroad Company, says that “no government can endure with 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 of its citizens out of employment to take care of themselves and their families”. He and Judge Rutherford might be right and you and some Albuquerque preacher might be wrong, and it is better to be right when the right course brings only happiness and the wrong course brings only sorrow and disappointment. The government Jesus told you to pray for is the one you really want, but you don’t yet realize how much you need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Events in Canada </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font6">ESUS CHRIST, because of faithfulness to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God, His heavenly Father, and because He stated the priests who claimed to represent and serve God in His day were ‘blind guides! serpents! fools! vipers! hypocrites, whited sepulchres full of dead men’s bones’, was charged with sedition and murdered at the instigation of the same clergy. He told the truth; therefore the priests murdered Him. History repeats itself even as the Scriptures foretold, ‘If ye live godly in Christ Jesus ye shall suffer persecution.’ Today the Catholic priesthood is the counterpart of the priesthood of Israel and manifests the same spirit in its opposition to truth. In the province of Quebec the Roman Catholic priests are extremely bitter towards Jehovah’s witnesses as they go from door to door with the glad tidings of God’s kingdom for the blessing of mankind. Time and again they have stirred up the civil authorities to arrest them and throw them into jail on one false charge or another. Recently in Hull, Quebec, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, Emerie St. Amour, called one of the little priests a hypocrite, even as Jesus called them in His day, and for this the local magistrate, the tool of the priest, sentenced him to one month in jail. This witness, with two others, has also been maliciously charged with distributing seditious literature and committed for trial. Millions upon millions of Canadians have in their libraries the very same literature, and all know how false the charge is; so, of course, the action of the priest is bound to act as a boomerang in due course.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Mouse and Snail Juice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Under the caption “A Snail in a Bottle”, the following item of interest appeared in the Vancouver </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Province:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Vancouver, a short time ago, a judge and jury at the spring assize occupied themselves for a day or two with the ease of a mouse in a bottle. A Vancouver citizen had purchased some root beer. He and a friend had drunk of it and both had become ill. They blamed their illness on a dead mouse found in the bottle and sued the manufacturer for damages. They were awarded contemptuous damages: $1.00 each. The jury said in its verdict, quite plainly, that, in its opinion, the action should not have been brought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In London, about the same time, five law lords were hearing an appeal from a Scottish court involving a snail in a bottle. The case was much the same as the one which was argued in Vancouver. A Glasgow woman had purchased some ginger beer and become ill after drinking it. A snail was found in the bottle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The woman sued the manufacturer for £500. The Scottish court dismissed the action and the woman appealed to the House of Lords. There the court divided. Three of the learned judges decided the woman had a case and gave her the damages she sought. The other two dissented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be thought that the spectacle of five great jurists deliberating solemnly over a snail in a bottle is more ridiculous than edifying. But, in giving judgment, Lord Atkin stated that he did not think a more important problem had occupied their lordships in their judicial capacity. The question, he said, was whether the manufacturer of an article of drink sold by him to a distributor in circumstances which prevented the distributor or the ultimate purchaser or consumer from discovering by inspection any defect, was under any legal duty to the ultimate purchaser or consumer to take reasonable care that the article was free from defect likely to cause injury to health. His judgment was that the manufacturer was under such legal duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law is proverbially said to take no notice of small things. But the law decides when things are small and when they are great, and in the case of the snail in the bottle, a great principle was involved, that the manufacturer of foods owes a duty to the consumer of those foods. He must exercise care that the foods are not injurious. It is an important decision in these days, when almost everything is bought in packages, and the manufacturer’s warranty must be taken.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Siamese Twins Railway Fares</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">A short time ago the Canadian National Railway had quite a problem on its hands, according to the following news item from Winnipeg which appeared in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font6"> of Saskatoon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Siamese twins, always an attraction at fairs and exhibitions, have now attracted the attention of the railway companies as to the number of tickets required for their transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, the Canadian National was required to submit its views on the subject to various passenger associates, with headquarters in Chicago who point out that there are conflicting legal opinions by American lines. One railway, through its law department, says Siamese twins, although two persons and possessing individual faculties, are one inseparable entity. They are so pinned together, competent medical authorities have ruled, that when one dies, the other must die. Wherever one goes, the other must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The legal department of another railway holds that two tickets are required, and rules the subjects are designated as twins and they have all the physical characteristics of separate individuals. Many suggestions might be advanced to indicate they are two persons or entities. For instance, records show the original Siamese twins were married. They could and probably do own separate property. A merchant furnishing apparel for two would not be satisfied with the price for one, nor is it likely that a restaurateur or the dining car department would supply meals for two at the price of one. Passenger fares are not based on lineal or cubic measurement or weight; age is the only governing factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Making the Best of the Depression</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While conditions among many of the farmers in western Canada are very bad indeed, they are trying to make the best of things. Some of them, not financially able to run their cars, have taken the wheels, axles and springs off and converted them into a very comfortable buggy. As the wear on the tires is almost nil, they will last for some time. Many have taken off the generators, rigged up a windmill and attached the gears of the generator to it, and thus generate their own electricity to run washing machines, for electric lights, and to charge radio batteries without any cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not being able to get anything for meat, beef, chicken and pork, many of the farmers can half a beef and dozens of chickens and have fresh meat all summer at little or no expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The price for cream is so low that some store ice and make ice cream, which they sell, making as much as $5.00 a week, instead of only $1.00 or $2.00 for cream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not being able to buy dresses, many women wear overalls, made in beach pyjama style, which are quite serviceable for farm work, and cost possibly 50c at the farm homes; and many in towns wear no stockings.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Economic Conference Fiasco</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Economic Conference of the nations and dominions of the British Empire is now history, and while some sections of the capitalistic press announce it a great success, others are not so optimistic. Thinking people who have given the matter any thought are generally agreed that it will bring little or no relief from the intolerable oppression heaped upon the masses. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Furrow,</span><span class="font6"> of Winnipeg, has the following to say concerning it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hostility to the Soviet Union is the only issue on which unity was expressed at the Imperial Conference at Ottawa. On all other matters the hagglings of the market place characterized the actions of the “statesmen”. The clash of interests between the capitalists of Canada and Great Britain was so obvious that even the daily press featured it. Bennett, as the representative of the Canadian plunderbund, sought to capture a larger share of the British market for grain and lumber in return for shadowy concessions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">the Federation of British Industries. But the representatives of Great Britain looked the gift horse in the mouth and saw its true character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Political considerations today outweigh economic needs, and the basis of agreement between Canada and Great Britain has been worked out on the political needs of Great Britain to isolate the United States of America and to consolidate the forces of imperialism for the attack on the USSR. For the carrying out of these two major needs of British diplomacy there is no doubt that secret agreements were arrived at between the representatives of the exploiting countries of the British Empire. The exploited peoples, of course, were totally unrepresented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite all the talk that may be put forward about the “success” of the Conference, to the workers and farmers it can mean but one thing: more slavery and another imperialist war.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Sound Sense from the Prince of Wales</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">That tariff walls are not the way to economic peace and good will is realized by many. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix,</span><span class="font6"> under the caption “No Empire Wall'’, editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have entertained some vague idea that the British Empire can be made self-contained by a tariff wall built all around it, and who look upon the Imperial Economic Conference as being the opportunity to create such a barricade, arc receiving little encouragement these days. Repeatedly it has been pointed out that such a circumstance is impossible; that the empire is blessed with such a plenitude of raw materials, natural resources, agricultural products, that it must continue to seek the world market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The latest empire figure to voice opposition to isolation is the Prince of Wales. On July 1, Hon. G. Howard Ferguson, Canadian high commissioner at London, gave a great dinner in honor of the British delegates to the conference to bid them Godspeed. The Prince of Wales was to have been present and prepared a speech for the occasion. At the last minute he was unable to attend, but his brother, Prince George, took his place and read the speech that had been prepared by the heir to the throne. Here are a few paragraphs from it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No group of countries can isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Canada and Australia cannot dispense with the world market for their wheat. Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand cannot dispense with the world market for their wool. The United Kingdom needs the world market for her manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Maybe, taking the long view, the empire will, by drawing closer together, become in time less dependent on the rest of the world, but such a change must come gradually and by the natural process of evolution, guided and not forced by government action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the meantime it is of the utmost importance in our interests that so far from taking any steps that might discourage foreign countries we should make every effort at Ottawa to put heart into the world and concert measures in which other countries may later cooperate.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>In What Year Were You Married?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">How many men, if the question were put to them suddenly, could tell without hesitation the year in which they were married? In a case before Judge John S. Campbell in county court two witnesses replied incorrectly, and had to amend their statements. Both had been married within the past decade. One said he had been married in 1926, but when the lawyer pointed out that he must be mistaken he said it was in 1924. The second man swore he had been married in 1926. A little later he said: “I wish io make a correction in my evidence. I told you I was married in 1926. It was in 1925.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Sent to Prison for $1.50</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font6"> editorially reports a case of modern tyranny in Toronto. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Walter Brooks of Toronto wanted his furniture moved and engaged a carter whom he had hired for the same purpose on three previous occasions. On one of these occasions he had paid cash; on the others, he had paid when able. He claims that for the fourth and recent trip he was promised at least two weeks in which to pay, but a few days after his goods were moved he received a judgment summons to appear in court for failure to meet the bill of one dollar and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He thought he could get the money in a week, and Magistrate Patterson allowed him that time in which to raise it. But work was unobtainable, and at the end of the week he went to a police station and reported his failure. The sergeant ordered him taken to jail, where he was told he must serve ton days. There he would apparently have remained, but Aid. Leslie paid his debt and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font5">dollar costs, and the unfortunate man was set </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">circumstances of the case as they have been outlined in the press, and if they fairly represent what actually happened, a serious injustice has been done. Unless there was some element of fraud in the transaction, or some element of willful contempt of court, it is difficult to see what excuse could be advanced for committing Brooks to jail. Jail sentences for ordinary debt, abolished in England in 1869, are hardly to be expected in Canada in 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for Brooks, he was summonsed under the masters and servants act, which is not designed to cover the dealings of a customer with a tradesman, but to pro-tcct workmen who are owed money by their employers. He was summonsed, and he was finally sent to prison, for a debt of $1.50.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Canada’s Huge Insurance Swindle</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The most colossal swindle of the people of Canada in the history of this country, it is alleged, has been perpetrated by the administrators of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. Railway swindles, the swindling of natural resources, etc., are as nothing in comparison, if it be true, as alleged, that the Sun Life steal from the people reaches the fabulous sum of one billion dollars. The charge is made, yet the Government of this country, which, it is said, knows the facts, does nothing and is afraid to do anything!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of Coninieice</span><span class="font6"> fearlessly attacks these men of high finance and shows up the prime minister of this land in no uncertain terms in an article entitled “The World’s Greatest Crooks T. B. Macaulay and Ivar Kreuger’’. We quote in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SIMILARITY OF METHODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both Macaulay and Kreuger won the confidence of governments and then proceeded to swindle their people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They were both Junkers and each played the role of a Croesus with consummate success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They both faked their books and presented such balance sheets, padded with fictitious assets, as best suited their purposes, and thus deceived those upon whom they preyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They were both colossal liars, claiming for themselves just the opposite of what they were, and bluffed their way out of many a difficult situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kreuger did not believe in an after-life and was frank and honest about it. Macaulay capitalized a feigned religious attachment. He was a churchman without the necessary moral foundation. He was a religious hypocrite, and therefore differed from Kreuger in this respect only by being more contemptible and more dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each succeeded in securing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">protection </span><span class="font5">of the government of his native country. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Kreuger </span><span class="font5">was protected by the prime minister of Sweden, and Macaulay by the prime minister of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the end they were both deprived of their ill-gotten gains and offered to an astonished and wrathful people as sacrifices on the altar of wealth by the Rothschilds, the Morgans, the Beaverbrooks, the Holts and the Flavelles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T. B. MACAULAY </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">insurance king, crcesus and crook</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a previous issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of Commerce</span><span class="font5"> it was stated that “The Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada is not an insurance company. It is a gigantic international swindle masquerading in the guise of writing life insurance. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The managements of life insurance companies in general are inspired by the thought that the funds they are handling have been entrusted to them for the special purpose of taking care of his dependents after the death of the policyholder or for taking care of the policyholder himself in his old age. Life insurance funds are therefore the most sacred of all trust funds. The first consideration in the investment of such funds should be safety and security; the element of speculation should be absolutely eliminated. The next consideration should be economy of management; and the third, care in the selection of lives, so as to keep down the mortality or death-rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An examination of the facts and figures which follow will show that these fundamentals of life insurance have been completely ignored by the management of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. The Sun Life has been operated on lines different from any life insurance company. It is not a life insurance company. The Sun Life has been operated on the lines of a business run in the interests of the few who control it, although these have contributed less than onefifth of one percent of the funds, while the policyholders have contributed over ninety-nine and four-fifths percent. The policyholders’ funds have been used for stock promotion, speculation and manipulation. Where there were profits, these have been absorbed by the management and their friends; and where there were losses, they have been taken care of with policyholders’ funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE SUN LIFE IS A SWINDLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In no respects does the Sun Life bear a resemblance to any life insurance company in Canada, or, as a matter of fact, to any life insurance company anywhere in the world. According to the last Canadian Government Report, the Sun Life has over percent of all its policy holders’ fund invested in common stocks, whereas the investments of all other Canadian companies in common stocks is less than lit, percent of all their funds; and these are mostly of banks and trust companies, whereas those held by the Sun Life are almost entirely of inflated or watered stocks, largely the creations of their own directors and their friends. Most of these watered stocks cost the promoters nothing. They do not represent a dollar of investment; yet they were sold to the Sun Life at about the highest point of their inflation. For example, the Sun Life paid over par for the common stock it holds in the St. Regis Paper Company, which has since depreciated to 11,4 <sup>a</sup> share, at which price this investment shows a loss to the Sun Life policyholders of $9,653,888.24. To argue that this stock will come back to its former price level is to assume that the wild inflation period of 1928 and 1929 is to return, which, God forbid!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These watered stocks must be wiped out entirely through liquidation if the St. Regis Company is to be put upon a sound business basis, as has been done already with many of the Sun Life’s so-called “investments”. For example, the Sun Life has $13,226,989.92 of its policyholders’ funds in the stocks of the Middle West Utilities Company, a promotion by Samuel Insull, to whom, at times, the Sun Life made large personal loans to enable him to put through his promotions and watering of the stock which was later sold to the Sun Life. This is only one of many conspiracies to defraud the policyholders of the Sun Life. The Middle West Utilities Company is now in liquidation, and thus another IS<sup>1</sup>/! millions of the policyholders’ funds in the Sun Life is a total loss. The Sun Life also holds 26,000 shares of the stock of Ivar Kreuger’s International Match Corporation, now in liquidation, which is also a total loss of $2,017,960.03 of its policyholders’ funds. The Sun Life has over $50,000,000.00 of its policyholders’ funds invested in several promotions engineered by its own directors, such as Canada Power and Paper Company, Abitibi Power and Paper Company, St. Maurice Valley Corporation, Shawini-gan Water and Power, Asbestos Corporation, Port Alfred Corporation and Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated, all of which show a loss of over $35,000,000.00. Several of these items show a total loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total loss of the Sun Life’s investments in stocks alone is an aggregate of over $200,000,000.00, and its total loss in all its investments is well over $300,000,000.00. The total loss which it will be found the Canadian people have suffered as a result of the Sun Life’s promotion of watered stocks and the speculation fever it engineered is well over $1,000,000,000.00. This campaign was so cleverly engineered that a rumor of the Sun Life’s interest in a company was sufficient to induce a mad rush for the securities of that company.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Doukhobors in British Columbia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The following is a very interesting open letter from the Sons of Freedom to the inspector of the British Columbia police:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot; Dear Mr. Cruikshank :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot be silent any longer. You have caused our hearts to burst. If your eye is human, you could have seen blood dripping from the hearts of mothers and fathers. Oh, you civilized, cultured folks. You think that you are fulfilling something great by the actions as you have committed last night. Just consider and reflect the picture: 15 of you uniformed fully with revolvers staged a scene for innocent kiddies as doves that will be long remembered. You have shoved our kiddies in a manner that a good stock breeder would never do to his cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You men have showed not only ignorance, but something last of barbarity. Just imagine not to permit parents to say even good-bye or know where you are taking them, is indeed a very good cultured example. And you know well that they were nurtured with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font5">difficulties and hardships. Yes, you are taking them to school to be educated. Oh God, what a good instruction from the very first step. “Kicking, hissing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">frightening them to death.” Yes, an exact copy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of a </span><span class="font5">picture from American Negro slave days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You are trying to play with us, as a cat with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">mouse. We know how you look on us. We also know that you do not classify us as human creatures. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">do not blame you for such ignorant outlook. Because this is the path of your present false culture, the days of which are counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now we want to bring before you a few facts and we also want you to open them to the public eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not playing with any tricks or foolishness, as you may think. We deal seriously with every problem of life. We consider our position as a world’s historical movement, based on sound foundation. We are working earnestly and sincerely fulfill the laws of life, which the Great Man from Galilee has explained: “Thou shalt not kill.” In the name of the truth, Christ has taken the cross. Thousands of Christian martyrs have taken the same path. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. . . Therefore, we say: True Christ first of all. Christ’s demands were few and simple. He did not make any attempts to establish churches, governments, laws, courts, police or armies, as we see today. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">powerful voice called for brotherhood of all men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Do </span><span class="font5">unto others as you want others to do unto you.’ Can we trace anything of His teaching in our present social life? No, there is nothing near to it. All churches have bowed themselves before Satan, buried deeply into dead dogmatism; and, as empty barrels, make nothing but the noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our entire nature rebels against the prison house that the mammonistie spirit of this age has fashioned. We cry with all the voice we have: “Civilization is in danger. It will fall with a terrific crash, because the foundation of it has rotted.” Christ has prophetically warned of this coming great danger, “All they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You can think whatever way you please, but our aims are pure and open. Although our ways of struggles are peculiar to the civilized eye, but we know from history that Christ was called a fanatic and convicted as a rebel, by the high authorities of His time. Also all the true idealists of all times were persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are doing our duty before our own conscience and the almighty Father. Therefore, we declare we cannot permit you to continue your persecution of us and our innocent children. We are saying to you friendly and openly that we are not going to any islands as slaves. Please do not lay on us any hopes. We are not going to do any work whatsoever. Because we have been toiling peacefully, without anybody’s aid, we are not asking for it in future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Th<sub>e</sub> QOLDEN AQE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All we ask is freedom, and only freedom. Therefore we want the situation solved here once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In conclusion we declare that we have sacrificed for the holy freedom, our homes, chattels and children. And today we are sacrificing with the last that we have—ourselves. We refuse all food, in protest of all your inhuman actions. Once more we cry to all of you: “Repent, repent, and repent.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Peter Birureoff</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The appeal of the “Sons of Freedom” however, fell on deaf ears, as the following Canadian Press report from Vancouver records:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little green island in the Gulf of Georgia became prison today to twenty Sons of Freedom who for the first time saw the place where they must spend the next three years. They were sent over from Vancouver and will be followed by similar groups until the entire body of 600 nude paraders are settled in their place of confinement. Meantime, some 300 of their children will be eared for in provincial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead of spending the winter on their well-kept farms amid seasonable cold and snow in the southern interior, the Doukhobors will winter amid the soft rains of the mild coast climate. They will be housed in newly-built quarters surrounded by barbed wire ten feet high and may pursue their occupation of farming to some extent, the men on one side of the island, the women on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pier island is about 25 miles from Victoria, by water. It contains about 250 acres, of which approximately 200 acres are suitable for agricultural lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The penitentiary will consist of wooden frame buildings to accommodate guards and prisoners and be so arranged as to entirely segregate the two sexes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Persecution of an Upright Judge</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">That any honest, fearless judge has a hard time is evident from the following press report from Ottawa:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Justice Frank Ford, of the supreme court of Alberta, has been appointed to conduct an inquiry into remarks reported to have been made in recent criminal cases by Judge L. St. G. Stubbs, Winnipeg. Official announcement to this effect was made this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Protest by Hon. W. J. Major, attorney-general for Manitoba, against statements of the Winnipeg county judge reached Hon. Hugh Guthrie, minister of justice, during the week-end. The protest, it is understood, was that statements of Judge Stubbs were a deterrent to the administration of justice in Manitoba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reported remarks of Judge Stubbs were in cases which were tried by him in Winnipeg. One was the prosecution of two youths charged with breaking and entering. Another was the case of a cashier charged with theft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Winnipeg judge was reported to have said in sentencing the youths charged with breaking and entering : “ When school boards shut off full classes they are making criminals and there is a criminal responsibility on them. We can expect a lot more of this sort of thing unless young men are put to work or allowed to enter educational institutions. Our youth will become demoralized and degenerate.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of the cashier who was charged with theft from his employers of $2,480.13, the judge, after referring to a case involving a much larger sum, Was reported to have stated: ‘ ‘As the court of appeal has held a term of 18 months is a proper sentence for theft of $284,177.18, what would be the proper sentence for this man? I am going to acquit you. The next time you get into trouble you will have a big credit to your offense.” The accused had been in jail for some time awaiting trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The judge was reported at one time to have stated there was a law for the rich and another for the poor. Judge Stubbs was reported to have said on one occasion ;• “When a few wealthy rogues can steal more money than all the bank robbers and hold-up men and get off with a nominal sentence it is very disturbing; not only to some of the judges, but in the very serious effect it has on the mind of the public. ’ ’</span></p>

But that is not a sufficient reason for the great difference in coal haulage rates that exists, and it is well known in shipping circles that the freight rates for hauling anthracite coal are far higher than they should be. The reason the rates are kept up is that the same crowd that owns the mines owns the railroads. At any rate, this is true to a large extent.</span></p>

The regulations, after stating that no loose milk may be offered for sale to a consumer except it is dispensed from a pump or similar mechanical dispensing device approved by the board of health, hasten to explain that no such device has yet met with its approval. A hospital or an institution that feeds or cares for a large number of persons may buy its milk in bulk after it has received from the board of health a certificate entitling it so to do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>The Earliest Inhabitants of Terra Firma — the Birds</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>In Three Parts —</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part 2</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We Confess the Sins of the Crows</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that we are confessing the sins of the crow family, we may as well admit that they are all thieves, and this includes the beautiful jays, of whom there are many varieties. Along with the magpies and the common crows they delight to collect and hoard glittering or bright-colored objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Canada jay is well known to hunters and lumbermen, whose camps it haunts with the greatest boldness. The magpie has no reputation at all, but because it is a beautiful bird and has a pert, merry manner, it acts as a common sneak thief around human habitations, and robs the nests of other birds, and gets away with its crimes as a Mineola policeman does with murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The raven. Well, who expects anything from a raven? It can be set down as certain that the raven which fed Elijah in the wilderness, and brought him bread and flesh every morning and every evening, paid not one cent for the goods, which he probably appropriated from some store in Damascus when the proprietor’s back was turned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The raven is easily domesticated and becomes much attached to his master, following him about like a dog. He can be taught to imitate the human voice and to pronounce a few words with great distinctness. Eavens usually travel alone or in pairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Their nests are on inaccessible cliffs or in tall trees. The eggs are four to eight in number, two inches long, light greenish blue with numerous light purple and yellowish brown blotches at the larger end. The young remain in the nest for several weeks, where the parents feed them at first with semidigested food. It is said that a raven can clearly voice anger, alarm, humor, pleasure, roguery and even disdain, the latter by a kind of snort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The crow is the acme of craft, cunning and cruelty. He can count to three. If three persons enter a cornfield to lie in wait with guns, the crows will remain in distant tree tops until three persons have gone out before they will enter the field; but if four persons enter and three go out, the crows miss their count and return to the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the crow language there is one cry for “danger ahead”, another for “let’s go”, while a still different cry declares that “all’s well”. The</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">average crow takes delight in perching on the tattered hat or shoulders of a scarecrow. He is a great weather prophet. If rain is imminent he will rise from his nest, wheel about overhead and return. If his stay in the air is short the storm is nigh; if he remains some time in the air the storm will be slow in coming; if he remains long in the air and at the same time is very noisy the disturbance will be severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Crows are sometimes kept for pets, and become quiet and peaceful. They have even been known to talk. Jaco, a crow that has been exhibited at the New York Hippodrome, is so valuable that an insurance of $50,000 is carried upon his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This Bird Is a Cuckoo</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Compared to a cuckoo, any member of the crow family is a hard-working, honest, praiseworthy member of society. A female cuckoo gets her eye on a nest belonging to some other bird, which nest already has in it eggs of a certain color. She then lays an egg of that color on the ground, picks it up in her bill, conveys it to the nest, and not infrequently pitches the rightful contents out upon the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The young cuckoo, as soon as it gets out of the shell, works itself beneath any eggs or other young birds in the nest, raising them on its back and tumbling them over the edge of the nest. But it remains true to its foster parents in just one particular, and that is, when the time comes for it to lay eggs, it selects that nest or one like it in which to deposit its family hopes. That is what may be termed cuckoo family loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a West Indian cuckoo which differs from the above-described European cousin. It builds its own nest, which, however, is merely a rude platform of twigs. Then it lays a considerable but variable number of pale green eggs at long and irregular intervals, with the result that the same nest frequently contains freshly deposited eggs along with young birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Duck Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The goose. He is an odd duck, isn’t he? Well, that is just what he is: a member of the duck family. And so is the swan. And, all taken together, they take to their environment just “like a duck does to the water”. A duck has a mouth specially constructed so it can squeeze the nutriment out of mouthfuls of ooze. It can</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">sleep on the water, one foot gently moving so as to keep the bird turning about in nearly the same place. The plumage is so laid on as to protect the body from becoming wet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every waterfowl, such as the duck, dresses its feathers with oil which it presses from a gland above the tail. There are two weeks in August in which wild ducks cannot fly. All members of the family lose all their large wing feathers at the same time. Geese also molt in the same way, losing all their large wing feathers at once. The most luxurious homes on earth are the nests of the eider ducks, the down for which the mother plucks from her own breast at molting time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All ducks are very strong and swift on the wing. Many of them make semiannual migrations between the tropics and the shore of the Arctic ocean and are known to make 100 to 130 miles an hour while on the wing. All together there are about 125 species catalogued, some of them very beautiful. European ducks occasionally visit American shores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most beautiful of all American waterfowl is the wood duck. The upper parts are green, with purplish reflections; the breast is dull red; the sides, buff; and the lower<sup>-</sup> breast, white. The head has an elongated drooping crest, which is divided lengthwise by a white line and is edged with white. Curving white lines ornament the neck, shoulders and coverts of the wing, which displays a speculum of steel blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This beautiful bird makes its nest in the hollow of a decayed tree, at a great distance from the ground. At the proper time the youngsters of the family are encouraged to let themselves drop to the ground, upon which they fall so lightly as to suffer no injury. But sometimes they are carried down by the mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wild ducks are quite easily tamed. Indeed, the tame ducks of commerce had wild ancestors not so long ago. The banding of a large number of ducks in Kansas showed that in summer most of them go to the Dakotas, and in winter to the bayous of Louisiana and Texas. A few found their way to bays on the Pacific coast, and one was found on Behring sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are about thirty kinds of geese. The goose molts but once a year. It is long-lived, cases having been known where they have attained to the age of 40. The wild goose, in migration, flies at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are ten varieties of the swan, a bird which at one time, in Great Britain, none but the king might own. On the water no other creature possesses the grace and beauty of the swan. On March 31, 1932, 150 to 200 wild swans that had alighted on an ice floe were swept over Horseshoe Falls, Niagara, during the night, and crushed to death on the rocks and ice below. About 300 that were on the floe managed to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dearborn </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span><span class="font6"> tells us that in a lake in one of the western provinces of Canada there are still preserved a few specimens of the trumpeter swan, a beautiful white bird with a wing-spread of ten feet, which once ranged from Hudson bay to the Pacific coast and south to the Gulf of Mexico and southern California. Until recently this beautiful bird was supposed to be extinct. The Canadian government has appointed a caretaker of the last remaining representatives.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>The American Eagle</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Time was when the American eagle was to be found almost everywhere on this continent; and it is still plentiful in Alaska, where approximately 25,000 were killed during the years 1917 to 1923, on the ground that they were seriously affecting the salmon supply by destroying the fish while spawning in the small streams; also that they kill a great many fawns of deer, and young forest and shore birds, as well as ducks and geese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The eagle is a bird that is naturally shy and wary, clean and handsome, swift in flight and strong in body. He is as formidable as any creature of the wild, being more than a match for any animal of his size. He stands firm before every bird or animal that can come against him, excepting only man. Eagles mate for life and remain together year after year. The same is true of swans and geese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the same day, in January, 1921, two boys in Depere, Wis., had a thrilling battle with an eagle that attempted to carry one •of them away, while in Tampa, Florida, two other children were attacked. In the latter instance the bird was shot and killed, measuring six feet from tip to tip. In July of the same year two women of Greensburg, Pa., succeeded, after a desperate battle, in recovering from an eagle’s talons a three-year-old child just as the eagle was about to fly away with the little one. In November of the following year New York crowds along Biverside Drive were thrilled by the sight of an eagle 1,500 feet in the air, flying along with a dog in its talons. Pedestrians at first supposed it to be an airplane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Near Santiago, Chile, in February, 1922, a soldier shot an eagle and supposed that he had killed it. When he approached, the bird attacked him furiously. In the struggle which followed, one of the eagle’s claws clutched the trigger of the gun, which was discharged, the bullet entering the man’s body. He died in the arms of his companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eagles, buzzards and cranes fly through the air for minutes and even for hours without moving their wings. Their broad, light wings are spread to catch the upward-moving currents of air; and with their wonderful wings, steering tail-feathers and marvelous muscular and nervous systems they are able to sail forward in any direction, propelled by the powers of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From a thousand feet in the air the eagle sees the hare, a mere speck, and falls upon him like a thunderbolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are some three hundred species of eagles, one of which, the so-called “bald eagle”, was selected as the national emblem of the United States. Benjamin Franklin, who wanted the thoroughly native and useful wild turkey as an emblem, argued against the bald eagle in this wise:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is a bird of bad moral character; he does not get his living honestly; you may have seen him perched on some dead tree, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labor of the fishing-hawk and, when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish and is bearing it to its nest, the bald eagle pursues him and takes it from him. Besides, he is a rank coward; the little kingbird attacks him boldly. He is therefore by no means a proper emblem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mexico selected as its emblem the crested eagle, or harpy, found in all parts of the Mexican republic. This bird, in both Mexico and Peru, has been trained in falconry, to catch deer and other game for its master. The Aztecs called it the winged wolf. It will easily conquer a dog or even a wildcat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An eagle recently tied up communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for a short time. She built her nest on the transcontinental telephone line. Not content with sage brush and survey stakes, she put in some pieces of wire and spare automobile parts and caused a short circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The finch family includes many of the most beautiful singers and most richly plumaged garden visitors as well as cage birds, the cardinal, canary, chaffinch, goldfinch, hawfinch, greenfinch, pine finch, house finch, lazuli finch and indigo bird. All of these are small, seedeating birds. Illinois and Kentucky have both adopted the cardinal finch as their official bird. Among all the birds the chaffinch has the name of being the earliest riser. On a summer morning he starts to sing at about 1: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">C. E. Jones, 5207 Hoy St., Vancouver, B. C., makes a specialty of the hand-rearing of wild birds. His picture has appeared in numerous papers, showing him in a semi-reclining position, reading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> One bird is perched in his hair, one on his collar, one on either lapel of his coat, six on other parts of his body, and one is perched on the top edge of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> Eighteen other birds are within a foot of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Jones, who is crippled, is one of Jehovah’s witnesses in his city. The park board there has awarded him $600 to care for the exhibit of handfed wild birds which he has presented to the city. In a letter to us he says that for a month in the life of each little bird it must be fed every hour from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. When the young ones are transferred, each is subjected to the closest scrutiny, through a powerful magnifying glass. Everything has been done along such strict lines of cleanliness that, so far, no living organisms have been found on the birds to be transferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One summer, in New York city, somebody’s canary got away and resided for several weeks in City Hall park, picking up its food with the sparrows and pigeons and drinking with them from one of the fountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The canary is the prize of song birds, but has to be trained. There are several schools in Yorkshire and Lancashire, England, where by means of a bird organ the canary is taught first one note and then another. The ideal training gives the bird four distinct notes: the water note, which as its name implies, is a rippling gurgle like the murmur of a rill; the whistling note; the flute note; and the rolling note, which is a continuous melody, splendidly rising and falling. The canary is a wonderful imitator, and therefore an excellent student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6"> German professor, Karl Reich, who breeds canaries to sing for recording purposes, employs nightingales to sing to his canaries, and after fifteen years’ work has bred a strain of canary adapted to the requirements of the nightingale’s tunes. Four canary records have been made, known as H.M.V.B. 2469, 2583, 3345, and 3958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Henschel, the ornithologist, tells of a bullfinch which had been taught to pipe the tune “God Save the King”, and of a young canary which learned it from him. At length the canary became so proficient that, when the bullfinch, whose cage was in an adjoining room, stopped after the first half a little longer than the proper rhythm warranted, the canary took up the tune where the bullfinch had stopped, and finished it. This happened several times.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Emu—Flamingo—Fl y catcher—Gannet</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The emu is the only one of its kind. It stands about five feet high, and is built on heavy lines. Its back is gracefully arched, and covered with rich brown plumage. The natives of Australia have about finished the last of the emus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The flamingo, a connecting link between the duck and the stork, is found in six species, in various parts of the world. A few of these bright red birds, nearly as tall as a man, are still to be found in some of the wilder parts of the Bahamas. The flamingo is easy to see, easy to kill, and easy to eat; and nothing but careful protection on a bird reservation can save it. When an intruder approaches the nests of the flamingoes they uftei' a deep, trumpet-like call, and, at a signal from the leader, spring into the air, a flaming mass, soaring away until they become a mere rosy cloud on the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The flycatchers; that is the family name of the kingbirds, pipiris, pewees and scissor-tails. Then, of course, there is the vermilion flycatcher. That name tells you what is its color and what it has for breakfast, dinner and supper and in between meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A writer in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> calls attention to the interesting fact that the phcebe flycatcher perches familiarly on the clothesline and makes its nest anywhere about the premises of human creatures, while other birds that look so much like it that only an expert can tell the difference avoid human creatures as they would the plague. The question naturally arises as to why this should be so, and it still awaits an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gannets are fishermen of the North. It takes six weeks with the webbed feet held over the egg before the lone baby gannet comes forth, and even then it is blind and naked. It is three months old before it catches its first fish, and in the meantime the parents favor it with halfdigested packets of fish which have been disgorged. The gannet has no fear of man, and for that reason is called by the Portuguese a “booby”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Gardener—Grackle—Grouse—Guinea</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The gardener bird of New Guinea clears a space about a small tree and erects a circular wigwam of twigs, with a cone of moss inside it. There are two doors in this little house; and in front of one of them a carpet of moss is laid, which is kept very clean and made attractive with bright-colored insects, fruits and flowers. When the flowers become withered the bird exchanges them for fresh ones. (To catch bees and butterflies, maybe??? Typist.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The grackle (blackbird) sings better in the rain than in the sunshine. When offered food he has a habit of soaking it in water before eating. He carries a chip on his shoulder, and bluejays and starlings know enough to keep out of the way. The coming of the grackle is a sure sign of spring. His judgment is never premature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In March, 1924, on the farm of J. R. Lippincott, Burlington, N. J., grackle to the number of hundreds fell suddenly to earth lifeless. The bodies showed no signs of poison, and it is conjectured that in some manner they were slain by conflicting radio currents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The grouse, which family includes pheasants, prairie hens, partridges, ptarmigans and moorhens, is a bird much in favor with sportsmen because of its fine table flavor. The rumbling drumming of the male is effected by rapid beating of the wings against the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The guinea fowl, of which twenty-three species are known, is found in its native state on the west coast of Africa, in the vicinity of the Niger river. It was domesticated in Rome during the classic era, but dropped out of sight. It is supposed to have been brought back to civilization by the early Portuguese explorers in the sixteenth century.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>The Gull Family</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The gull family, along with the terns, skinners and skuas, are of 53 known species. Skuas chase their smaller kin and force them to disgorge the fishes they have just caught. It does not seem a nice thing to do, but compared to some of the things that are pulled off by Big Business on the common people it is noble and princely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certain species of gulls (terns) fly from the Arctic regions to Patagonia, and scarcely deviate from a direct line in 10,000 miles. Much of the flying is done at night. The gull breeds as far north as it can find land for nesting, and winters as far south as there is open water for feeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gull has the distinction of being able to fly over great spaces of water, and to keep going longer without stop or rest than any other known creature. On a trip across the Atlantic ocean there is only one day when gulls are not seen. When weary the gull tucks its head under its wing and sleeps, riding the waves like a ship. The gull is a simple-minded bird; hence the term “gullible” as applied to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that oil-burning vessels are becoming common, many gulls, auks, puffins, loons and other sea birds, pounce down upon oil patches on the waters, only to find themselves coated with a substance which they cannot remove. The oil bunches the feathers together, allowing the cold water to penetrate to their skins. They catch cold and die. The gulls are learning to avoid the oil patches (proving that they are not so gullible after all), but the slower-witted auks and loons are fast disappearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gulls have been known to combine and attack an eagle and put him to flight. They regularly eat shellfish by carrying them aloft and dropping them on concrete highways to crack their shells. They have also been known to repeatedly drop stones on rats from such a height and with such precision as to kill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gulls probably have isolated representatives out as scouts, looking for general food supplies. Several times, in the West, gulls have come a thousand miles or more inland and completely stemmed invasions of locusts and crickets.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>The Hawk Family</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The falcons, or hawks, are, for strength, symmetry and powers of flight, considered the most perfectly developed of the feathered race. In France in 1790, one was found with a collar of gold dated 1610 showing it to have apparently belonged to Janies I of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hawks are found in all parts of the world, and number some 450 species. While the duck hawk (peregrine) and the fish hawk (osprey) use the same nest many years in succession, yet most hawks have Hollywood morals and get a new mate and make a new nest every season. While the hen hawk, of which there are three varieties (sharpshin, blue darter and goshawk), is the foe of the chickenyard, yet buzzard hawks and marsh hawks do the farmer far more good than they do harm, on account of the great numbers of field mice, rabbits, gophers, ground squirrels, grasshoppers and crickets of which they dispose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thoreau, who was a lover of bird life, wrote of a hawk needlessly slain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He saw but a pheasant in the field . . . and stooped to seize it. This was his offense. He, the native of the skies, must make way for those bog-trotters of another land, which never soar. The eye that was conversant with sublimity, that looked down on earth from under its sharp projecting brow, is closed; the head that was never made dizzy by any height is brought low; the feet that were not made to walk on earth now lie useless along it. . . . Those wings which swept the sky must now dust the chimney-corner, perchance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is claimed that a hawk has the power to remain in one position in the air; also that its maximum speed must be nearly 200 miles an hour. It has the sight to spy an object at twenty times the distance possible for the strongest human eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wild birds pursued by hawks always fly upward. As long as they fly upward the hawk cannot catch them; but if they make a mistake and try to escape by flying downward, the hawk soon overtakes them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heath Cock—Heron—Hoactzin</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Does it not make you feel a little bit sad to know that we are now living in the days of the last of the heath bird? Since 1928 only one bird has been seen, a male, now living off Martha’s Vineyard. The hunters have slain all but this lonely remnant of his race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The heron is much like the crane, except that when he flies he doubles his long neck over his back, with his long legs stretching behind him. His wings have a spread of six feet or more. The egret, a species of heron, a native of Florida, is now nearly extinct. It was from the plumes of this beautiful bird that the most beautiful millinery of a generation ago was made. Women paid immense sums to get these choice and beautiful feathers in their hats, and as a consequence there was great inducement to the hunters to decimate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At length a law was passed protecting the egret, but the law is ignored, and egret skins or scalps are smuggled out of this country to Europe where, in places, the aigrettes are still in fashion. In two instances federal wardens protecting egret colonies were slain by the illegal hunters. In the capture of 500 egrets a profit of as much as $10,000 has been realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hoactzin of Brazil is a bird of about the size of a chicken, able to fly short distances, to swim short distances, and to climb trees. It thrives only on the leaf of the aninga tree. None have ever been transported any great distance successfully, because of the futility of trying to keep on hand a supply of fresh aninga leaves.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Honey-Eater—Honey-Finder—Humming Bird</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The honey-eater of Australia has a tongue which is divided near the end into a fringe. With this long and peculiarly shaped tongue he is able to extract most of the nectar from a flower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The honey-creeper of the West Indies is really not after honey, but is in search of small insects. He renders an important service in the cross-fertilization of trees and plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The honey-finder of Africa is a most interesting little chap. He has an appetite for grubs and young bees and knows how to attract the notice of human creatures to places where they can be found. He knows that we humans are fond of honey, so when he has found a tree containing wild bees he has the humans go there to scare the bees away so he can get at their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The honey-finder will lead humans to any other interesting scene. They have been known to steer their two-legged dupes into leopards, pythons and other dangerous creatures. Hundreds of natives are lured to death every year by these intelligent little birds. They show plainly by their twittering and hopping along just out of reach that they fully expect to be followed to whatever it is they have sighted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A peculiarity about humming birds is that they cannot walk on a horizontal surface and are virtually helpless on the ground. A humming bird can be trained to sip weakened honey from a bottle, provided artificial flowers are tied over the neck of the bottle. The bottle can be moved little by little until finally it rests upon a window sill.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Kingbird—Kingfisher—Kite</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The kingbird is only a plain little bird about eight inches long. He has a flame-colored crest which he can erect or- conceal at will. In the nesting season he will without hesitation attack a crow, a hawk or an eagle, and puts up such a battle that they are glad to go off and leave him. The kinglet, a very small bird, hardly four inches in total length, has all the characteristics of the kingbird above mentioned, including the crest and the pugnacity. It has no hesitation in attacking a crow, jay or hawk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The kingfisher perches on a tree overhanging the water and watches for the passing of a fish. In an instant the fish is in its beak; in another instant the kingfisher is back on his perch, flips the fish in the air, and when the fish comes down he drops head first into the kingfisher’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The swallow-tailed kite, common in the southern states, not only can capture its prey and eat it while in full flight, but can come down and take a drink of water without loss of motion, like a limited train on the Pennsylvania filling its tender with water from a track tank while going sixty miles an hour.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Longspur—Loon—Macaw—Meadow Lark</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Could it be possible for a bird, or a million and a half of them, to get lost? It is a hard question; but it seems as though it might be. In March, 1904, it is estimated, a million and a half Lapland longspurs perished in a great snowstorm in Minnesota. Whether they miscalculated their position, or whether they miscalculated the severity of the storm, cannot be known, but the air was suddenly filled with immense numbers of birds flying wild, bumping into buildings and electric light poles, apparently as if they had lost their bearings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The loon, or great northern diver, is a magnificent bird some thirty inches in length. It has a wing stretch of four feet, and lives on fish, which it pursues by diving. The weird laughter of the loon is akin to the cry of a maniac and has given rise to the expression “crazy as a loon”. The legs of this bird are so far back on its body that when it is on shore it can progress only by rising on its feet and then falling heavily forward on its breast. Its cry to its young is a softly modulated duplicate of the cry that has given the bird its peculiar name. The expression “crazy as a loon” is often heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The macaw is sometimes trained as a pet. A lady in New York had one of these birds, known to his friends as Major Teuber. Major got into his mistress’ dressing room, and ate a quarterpound box of lip salve. They saved his life by rushing him to New York’s bird hospital, more generally known as the Virginia Pope hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Western meadow lark is the officially adopted bird of Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon and Wyoming; the mocking-bird, of Florida and Texas. In the spring the mocking-bird not only has his own pretty little song, but imitates all the other birds in the vicinity. He even gets fun out of imitating the frogs. In the fall his song is soft and low, of the reverie type; in the winter he sings not at all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The moa of New Zealand is no moa, if you will forgive us for saying such a thing. It is only four or live centuries since this gigantic bird, attaining a height of twelve feet roamed the lands of the Maoris. Not only its bones, but pieces of its skin, ligaments, feathers and eggs, have been recovered. The Maori traditions show the spot on which the last moa was killed by their ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nuthatches are tree-climbers, and no mistake. They spend their time navigating up and down the trunks of trees in the most restless and nimble manner, hanging in any attitude, supported by their strong, large feet alone and not needing any assistance from the tail. Ir. autumn and winter the nuthatch puts an acorn or nut in a crevice and hammers it open with his bill as nicely as you could do it with a nutcracker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Baltimore oriole, than which if there is anything more beautiful we cannot imagine what it could be, suspends its skillfully woven nest from the endinost twigs of high branches of the elm or sycamore. All together there are some forty species of American orioles. Of the 66 different birds that feed upon the cotton-boll weevil, the oriole is considered one of the most effective destroyers. Dry weather takes the life out of an oriole’s song. The bird is the official bird of Maryland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font6">HARLEVILLE, Queensland. “I just feel like writing a letter to you and the rest of Jehovah’s witnesses on the other side. I’ve never had the pleasure of listening to any of your lectures over the radio, but I have a great many books carried to me by Jehovah's witnesses. In fact, I think I’ve very nearly got the full set. I am pleased to say, Judge, that those books have brought me a wonderful knowledge of God’s kingdom on earth and also have been a wonderful comfort of heart to me. I fully hold with you and the rest of the witnesses that God’s kingdom is at hand and that it is the only hope for all the peoples of the earth. I solemnly declare to take my stand on the side of the Almighty God and do my very best to be in line with His commandments. You may use this letter for publication, or any part of it, if you wish.” R. P.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Resurrection of the Just and the Unjust</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE Bible is a book filled with messages of comfort and hope. It magnifies the name of Jehovah God, its author, by revealing Him as a God of comfort; a God in whom love, mercy, sympathy and compassion are blended with wisdom and power for the purpose of blessing all His creatures. It emphasizes the fact that these qualities are specially exercised in behalf of the sin-stricken human family. Paul the apostle reminds us of the “goodness of God” in these words: “Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”—Rom. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has never authorized anyone to scare people into repentance, nor to legislate righteousness into the hearts of the people; and centuries of effort along these lines have demonstrated the futility of such methods. Sooner or later the people must learn the truth of Paul’s statement, that it is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the loving, merciful and compassionate messages of the Bible, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead stands out as one of the foremost. It is comforting to know that we shall see our loved ones again; that broken hearts shall be healed and broken families shall be reunited at some not far distant date. It is just like our God to comfort the groaning creation with such a message of hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1 Thessalonians 4:13,14 we read: “I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.” In these words we have a resurrection message, and the apostle adds: “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” Again, in 2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4 we read: “Blessed be God, . . . the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.” Again, in Isaiah 61:1-4 it is written: “The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, ... to comfort all that mourn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what is the meaning of the apostle’s words, when he says: T -would not have you to be ignorant concerning them that are asleep’? Manifestly he refers to those that are asleep in death, for the hope he sets forth is a resurrection of the dead. Throughout the Scriptures the word “sleep” is used to represent the condition of the dead. It is a perfect illustration of their condition. A man who is asleep is unconscious, and will awaken in due time. Just so a man who is dead is unconscious, and will awaken to life again in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The majority, because of false teaching, are ignorant of the fact that dead persons are dead. They have been taught to believe that when a man dies he is more alive than ever, and this false teaching blinds them to the necessity of a resurrection of the dead. Paul is trying to correct this false teaching, by setting forth the truth that dead persons are asleep (unconscious in death) and that they will come forth from this condition by a resurrection of the dead. Now, says Paul, “comfort one another with these words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us examine the comforting message of the resurrection of the dead. According to the Bible there are two resurrections. Not two resurrections for the same individual, but one resurrection for one class, and a different resurrection for another class. In Revelation 20:6 we read: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.” Numerous texts refer to this first resurrection. Both resurrections are mentioned by Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15:22, 23, as follows: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be macle alive. But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.” Here are those that are called “firstfruits”, and another class that are resurrected “afterward”. Those who come up in the first resurrection are Jesus himself and His true church, the members of His body. Speaking of these, who come up in the first resurrection, Jesus tells us that “they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years”. —Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul mentions both these resurrections again in Acts 24:15, saying, “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.” Those who will arise in the first resurrection will be the just, and those who come forth later will be the unjust. Jesus also referred to both these resurrections, in John 5: 28, 29, in these</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■words: “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his [Jesus’] voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” The word translated “damnation” means judgment, and is incorrectly translated “damnation”, as all scholars agree. The point to be particularly noted in this text is that Jesus said that both the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font6"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">evil</span><span class="font6"> are to come forth in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The subject of the resurrection cannot be understood as long as anyone holds to the unscrip-tural idea that the dead are not dead. If we believe that good people at the moment of death go immediately to heaven, and that wicked people at the moment of death go at once either to purgatory or to a place of torment, and that both classes are more alive than ever, it will be utterly impossible to understand the subject of the resurrection of the dead. Such persons are forced to the conclusion that the resurrection consists of the resurrection of the body. But Paul plainly tells us, in 1 Corinthians 15: 35-37, that the body is not to be resurrected. The text reads: “But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?” He answers that question in these words: “That which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To understand the subject properly, one must believe the Scriptural statements respecting the condition of the dead, some of which are here quoted. In Ecclesiastes 9:5 is the plain statement that “the dead know not any thing”. In Psalm 146:4 it is written that when a person dies “he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish”. Again, in 1 Corinthians 15:18, Paul says that if there be no resurrection, “then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” Note what this text says, ‘If there be no resurrection, the dead are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">perished.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Accepting the Bible teaching that the dead are dead, it is easy to understand why a resurrection is necessary. According to the Bible, Jesus was dead for nearly three days, and was resurrected on the third day. He was in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea during those three days, and the record is that God raised Him from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, we ask, why the two resurrections ? The answer is that only the true church, which we are told, in Revelation 14:1-4, consists of only 144,000 members, will be in the heavenly kingdom. They are the just ones who will come up in the first resurrection. We are told that they will be like the Lord and see Him as He is and reign with Him a thousand years.—1 John 3:2; Rev. 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “unjust” will consist of all the heathen, all infants and all others who have never exercised a proper faith in God and in the Bible, because they either were never properly taught or never owned a Bible. They will be awakened right here on earth to have a trial for everlasting life, when they will be properly taught the truths of the Lord, and will learn for the first time of the goodness and love of God, and will be required to obey the laws of that kingdom, if they ever get everlasting life. This is what is referred to as “the resurrection of damnation” in the text of John 5: 29. The word “damnation” is used to translate a Greek word meaning “judgment”, and simply means that all these will come forth to have a trial, or judgment. If they are faithful they will get the gift of God, everlasting life right here on earth, just what Adam lost. If unfaithful, they will be destroyed in second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost, and Adam never lost a heavenly home. He was never offered a heavenly home. If he had never sinned he would still be living on earth. Repeatedly we are told in the Bible that God’s will shall eventually be done on earth as it is done in heaven; that He purposes to fill the whole earth with His glory; and that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess, both of things in heaven and in earth, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. It is because of the fact that there are two hopes of life, a heavenly one for the church, and an earthly one for the world of mankind, that there are two resurrections. All who prove stubborn, willful and rebellious are to be destroyed in second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the thousand-year judgment day all those who have never had a proper understanding of the divine requirements, all who have been taught false doctrines which misrepresent God, and all who died in infancy (too young to know the truth, too young to exercise faith, and hence ignorant of the only name given under heaven and among men whereby anyone can be saved), all such will be given the necessary instruction and be required to obey the perfect laws of God’s kingdom. This thousand-year period is the world's great judgment day, and is referred to by the prophet Isaiah (chapter 2d, verse 9) as follows: ‘'When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.’’ It will be a time of instruction. education and uplift, during which Satan will be bound so as not to be permitted to hinder the work. The resurrection of the unjust is in order that they may have such blessed privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How much grander is this thought than the one contained in the creeds, namely, that all the unjust who are dead are roasting in eternal torment. This is a comforting message. It gives us a hope for the heathen world. It gives us a hope for our friends who have died without accepting the Lord or professing to be Christians. It magnifies the love of God. It proves that His mercy is from everlasting to everlasting. The binding of Satan during that thousand-year day of judgment means the complete restraint of all outward forms of temptation; it means the end of all false doctrines ami every form of deception, thus making it easier for the unjust to come into full harmony with God. Those blessed privileges cannot be possible to the unjust unless they have an awakening from the sleep of death, and unless Satan is bound and proper instruction given them. Thank God, this is to be their happy lot in the near future.</span></p>

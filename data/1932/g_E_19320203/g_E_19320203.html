<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Land of the Incas</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HOSE who have, read Prescott’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Conquest of Peru</span><span class="font6"> will have been so impressed by the superior civilization of the Incas to that of their conquerors that they will perhaps give little thought to the earlier civilization upon which the Inca structure was based and which, in its way, is quite as noteworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The early builders of Peru, like the Incas who followed them, invented only ideographic signs in lieu of an alphabet and therefore have, left no history except such as may be gleaned from their works of architecture. These works of architecture are the most important in the Western world at the time when the first discoverers landed in America, and would be remarkable if found in any part of the world at any time. They are really in a class by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The valleys of Peru are lined with terraces ten feet high, and sometimes more than fifty terraces one above the other. The retaining walls of these terraces were built with great care. Back of the walls was dumped a coarse, gravelly subsoil, overlaid with a fine, rich top-soil. This work involved the laying of millions of perches of stone and the transportation of millions of tons of soil, and it is not known today where the soil was procured or how it was handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only are there tons of thousands of acres of these colossal terraces, or ‘'hanging gardens&quot;, as they are sometimes called, but there are in Peru cities built up on the mountainsides in a manner similar<sup>-</sup> to the terraces. Stones used in the construction of those cities are, some of them, so large that it would tax the power of any modern engineering device to handle them. These stones are laid one upon another with such precision that the unaided eye cannot discern the joint. It can be found only by means of a lens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Indians claim that the structures erected by the Megalithic or Big Stone people were never built at all, but were the work of enchantment. That claim has been made for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, the ruins of Baalbek at Palmyra, and also for the great images found on Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In at least three of these localities, namely, Peru, Egypt and Syria, there are traditions to the effect that the laws of gravitation were suspended when these structures were built and that their construction and erection was supervised by the angels. We are thus enabled to recognize the influence of the demons in these structures, their objective, of course, being to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah God to themselves and their works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While on this subject, we mention that at Baalbek there are blocks of stone twenty feet off the ground which are twelve feet in breadth, twelve feet in thickness, and sixty-four feet in height, and there is no machinery in existence today that could raise a stone of that weight to such a height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the districts of Peru where these terraces cover the slopes of the mountains other immense works were undertaken and carried out. successfully. The courses of the rivers were narrowed and straightened by the building of walls of enormous strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A system of aqueducts was built and the work was so well done that in modern times all that has been necessary to put them back into operation was to dig out the sand which in the course of centuries had drifted in and filled them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the advent of the airplane, which is now flitting hither and thither over Peru, many ancient cities, hanging gardens and aqueducts have been located, the existence of which were not previously known.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The Advent of the Incas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">About the year 1160 (A.D.) Manco Rapac (i.e., Manco, the ruler) appeared on the shores of Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable body of water in the world, and now constituting part of the border between Peru and Bolivia. Manco, the first of the Incas, informed the simple Indians that he had been sent by the sun to instruct them. He established his capital at Cuzco, and his descendants in what is regarded as the golden age of Peru, in 450 years, built up a remarkable civilization covering parts of the territory now included within Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, Peru contained six times its present population; money was unknown; labor was enforced on all for the benefit of all; the wants of the people were few and were easily satisfied; and there were frequent holidays and festivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Large flocks of llamas were grazed on the plateaus, while the hardy vicunas and alpacas roamed the upper heights in freedom but were driven together at stated periods to be shorn and killed. The wool yielded by these animals, and the cotton grown in the plains and valleys, were woven into fabrics remarkable for their fineness of texture and brilliancy of color.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Coming of the Spaniards</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">What the Spaniards did in Mexico, they did in Peru. A tribe of bloodthirsty and conscienceless assassins, dressed in armor, accustomed to the use of horses, and provided with guns and other superior weapons, they had no difficulty in seizing this great country which, at the time they entered it, had few soldiers, crude weapons, and little need for any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In September, 1532, the Spanish murderer, Pizarro, with a force of 177 men, twenty-seven of whom were cavalry, invaded Peru on what was purely a robber’s expedition. On November 1G of the same year, this band of thieves and murderers seized and imprisoned Atahual-pa, the then reigning Inca (or ruler or high priest of the sun’).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To gain his liberty, Atahualpa is reported to have said: “I will give gold enough to fill a room 22 feet long and 17 feet wide, up to a white line which is half way up the wall.” He said that up to that mark he would fill the room with different kinds of golden vessels, such as jars, pots, vases, besides lumps and other pieces. As for silver, he said he would fill the whole chamber with it twice over. He undertook to do this in two months. The gold and silver were melted in May, 1533, and on August 29, 1533, Atahualpa was garroted, and the Spaniards proceeded to utterly wreck the Inca civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to what it was that Pizarro and his men wrecked, let his own confession, sent to the king of Spain after his death, provide all the evidence that is needed. We recommend this confession to the careful consideration of the great financiers of Wall Street, to President Hoover, to Cardinal O'Connell of Boston, and to all the other pillars of the existing social order who have made the America of our fathers into the monstrosity that it is today, and we wonder how long it will take to extract a similar confession from these dignitaries:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The said Yncas governed in such a way that in all the land neither a thief, nor a vicious man, nor a bad, dishonest woman was known. The men all had honest and profitable employment. The woods, the mines, and all kinds of property were so divided that each man knew what belonged to him, and there were no lawsuits. The Yneas were feared, obeyed and respected by their subjects, as a race very capable of governing; but we took away their land, and placed it under the crown of Spain, and made them subjects. Your Majesty must understand that my reason for making this statement is to relieve my conscience, for we have destroyed this people by our bad examples. Crimes were once so little known among them that an Indian with one hundred thousand pieces of gold and silver in his house, left it open, only placing a little stick across the door, as the sign that the master was out, and nobody went in. But when they saw that we placed locks and keys on our doors, they understood that it was from fear of thieves, and when they saw that we had thieves amongst us, they despised us. All this I tell your Majesty, to discharge my conscience of a weight, that I may no longer be a party to these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After robbing Peru of its gold and silver, Pizarro returned to the sea-coast to build a city from which he could prevent some other thieves from taking from him the territory which he had taken from the Incas. Accordingly, seven miles from the mouth of one of the rivers flowing into the Pacific, and therefore seven miles from the present port of Callao, he founded the City of the Kings, the name of which was subsequently changed to Lima, the present Peruvian capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time Pizarro and his fellow thieves and murderers seized Peru there prevailed, and indeed there still prevails in some districts of the country which they overran, an “ayllus”, or community land system. This is a system of family communism by which the products of the common work are distributed, or by which certain tracts of land are allotted to each family in a community. In the operation of the original “ayllus” system the tracts of land were periodically redistributed to suit the size of a family, but in no case could the family sell or give away its tracts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>The Advent of the Catholic Church</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Imagine now the distress and confusion brought upon these millions of peaceable, peaceloving and prosperous people when the Spanish freebooters brought along with them another variety of priests who, like the Incas, claimed to have divine right to rule and to teach, but unlike the Incas, desired to keep the people in ignorance and to take possession of their lands, which, as a matter of fact, they claimed actually belonged to them to do with as they saw fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This latter line of priests acting under the instructions of an old man living at Rome who at times wears a triple crown supposed to make him the complete boss of heaven, earth and hell, his representatives proceeded to turn Peru into that portion of his empire represented by the third crown, the lowest one, as is their custom wherever they get a foothold.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Decay of Peru</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It cannot be wondered at that Peru has decayed, and that instead of a happy, busy and prosperous agricultural population estimated by some to have been as high as 30,000,000, the total number of inhabitants is now only about 5,000,000. The attempt to carry the burden of pillaging conquerors and conscienceless priests has been too much for the poor natives, who still constitute 57.6 percent of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The language of the common people of Peru is not Spanish, but Quichuan, the language of the Inca period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the entire population of Peru, only about 13 percent claim to be white. It is these whites of Spanish descent who govern Peru. About 24.8 percent of the population are classed as mestizos; about 4 percent are Chinese and Negroes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In bygone days the natives used to pay the Inca (the ‘ruler of the sun god’), in order to be assured of good crops, and while there has been a desperate effort on the part of the Catholic priests to switch these payments to themselves, yet the natives can well remember in their traditions the greater prosperity they had under the original Incas and are unconvinced that the Pizarro priests are as effective in procuring for them the temporal blessings they desire. Accordingly, all through Peru are thousands of Indians who still offer burnt offerings of medicinal and aromatic plants to the Incas to avoid the risk of offending them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 some 70,000 of these poor native Peruvians gathered themselves around a native who proclaimed himself the new Inca and demanded the return of their lands and the reestablishment of the “ayllus”. Two thousand of these poor creatures were killed before their aspirations for the return of their former rights and privileges were eventually crushed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The Peruvian Climate</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Though Peru lies wholly within the torrid zone and one part of it reaches to within a few miles of the equator, yet the country has every climate imaginable. The eastern two-thirds of the entire area called the Montana division is completely covered by great forests containing an untold wealth of tropical timber trees of the most valuable woods. The western edge of the country, a strip some thirty miles in width along the Pacific, is an arid, treeless belt, a complete desert except for oases provided by the forty-six river courses which cross it and the irrigation works built before the days of the Incas and now reopened and again in use. Between the two zones above mentioned is the Sierra or mountain region, which is the heart of Peru and the backbone of the South American continent. This district is of comparatively limited extent, being only about 3S0 miles from north to south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It thus happens that the natives of Bolivia and Peru, though living within the tropics, enjoy the stimulating climate of high temperate zones because of the elevation of their homes and valleys among the Andes. But although it often gets bitterly cold in the mountains, yet among the natives neither men nor women wear any footgear other than sandals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The highest peaks in Peru are Coropuna, 22,900 feet high, and Huascaran, 22,240 feet, but throughout the mountain region are many peaks 10,000 to 22,000 feet high. The line of perpetual snow is usually at about 16,400 feet, though in some situations a thousand feet lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Up from the south, along the entire western edge of Peru sweeps the Antarctic Current of cold water, bringing along with it a great quantity of fish that are everywhere else in the world strangers to such latitudes. The effect of this current is to cool the coastal plain somewhat, so that the hottest days of summer, from December to May, rarely show a temperature higher than 80° F., or the coldest in winter lower than 60°F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From June to November the Peruvian coast is subject to heavy fogs. These fogs are the source of very heavy dews, sufficient in many places to sustain a growth of grass. But, taken as a whole, it would be hard to find a more desolate region than the coastal desert of Peru.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The waters of Peru are rough, and as the shore line is almost unbroken, the country is without good harbors except at Callao, the port of Lima and Paita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On account of the great height and width of the Andes, the prevailing winds of the east are stripped of their moisture before they get to the coastal region, and therefore there are places in Peru where rain falls perhaps only once in ten or twelve years. In such sections the houses are built for shelter from the sun, not from rain, and when the showers do come, they do serious damage to the contents of the homes, and also to the cotton and other crops which are sustained by irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Sierra section contains some of the grandest scenery in the world. In one place high up in the Andes, thousands of feet above sea level, are deposits of marine shells showing that the entire region was once an inland sea. In one place is a mountain of rock salt said to be so clear that a newspaper can be read through two inches of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Montana section grows every specimen of tree and plant known to South American botany. This district includes fibrous plants and flowers in greatest profusion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>The Irish Potato from Peru</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Irish potato did not come from Ireland; it came from Peru, and this is Peru’s greatest single gift to mankind, and the world’s most productive crop. It is probable that the present-day value of a single world crop of potatoes exceeds that of all the gold that the conquerors took from the Incas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those.who know say that there are 200 varieties of potatoes growing in Peru with which the rest of the world is not yet acquainted. The potato did not come into instant use in Europe. It was after two centuries, and not until the period of the French Revolution, that it began to be grown as a crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before Pizarro and his fellow thieves and murderers entered the country Peru had more than sixty species of plants under general cultivation, and this country has been and is the chief center of plant domestication in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anything that will grow anywhere will grow in some part of Peru. Wheat, oats and barley are grown in the higher regions; sugar, cotton, grapes and olives, in the river valleys of the coastal section. Coffee and Indian corn are also grown, and there is an abundant supply of rubber. Coca is found wild in the forests, and there are-cultivated plantations. Peru supplies all the cocaine used in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fruits grown in Peru are oranges, grapes, bananas, lemons, alligator pears, cheri-moyas, papayas, loquats and sapodillas. The cherimoya is used extensively in flavoring of ice cream in Lima.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Peru has a great variety of plants, so it has also a great variety of animal life. In the Pacific Ocean off Peru seals and fish are plentiful. In the coastal regions are lizards, scorpions and tarantulas. In the Sierra are found the wool-bearing animals already mentioned, the llama, alpaca, guanaco and vicuna. The vicuna is diminishing rapidly. In the Montana section are found snakes, boas, vipers, alligators, turtles, parrots, flamingoes and all the creatures, big and little, that inhabit the tropical forests of Brazil.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>No End of Mineral Resources</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In the early history of Peru, hundreds of shiploads of guano were taken to foreign shores. When these deposits began to be exhausted, those who were engaged in that industry turned their attention toward the rich mineral deposits which make Peru a center of hidden treasures. Coal exists in Peru in vast quantities in all sections and in all forms. Ninety-live percent of the world's vanadium comes from Peru.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 10,000 mining claims on record, but only about 1,200 are being worked at all, on account of their inaccessibility. There is a great variety of mineral enterprises, including petroleum, silver, copper, vanadium, gold, coal, nickel, wolfram, cobalt, iron manganese, magnesium, graphite, sulphur, marble, porphyry, jasper, jade, alabaster, gypsum and kaolin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prevailing world-wide depression has resulted in the suspending of operations of the mining and smelting companies, and 4,000 miners are idle until the price of copper rises. These copper mines, like most of the other mines of Peru, are owned by Americans.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>From Donkey’s Back to Airplane</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Peru has no through railroads or wagon roads, and, until the invention of the airplane, had almost no way to get from one part of the country to another except on foot or by donkey. To go from Iquitos, on the Amazon, in the northeastern part of Peru, to Lima, the capital, used to take from twenty-five to thirty days of hard travel by mule and canoe. At present this trip is made in three days by one of the most spectacular air routes in the world. In the days of the rubber boom Iquitos was one of the richest towns in South America. The city is regularly reached by steamer service from the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are plenty of children in Peru who are very familiar with the airplane, but have never seen a locomotive or an auto in their lives. Although Peru is about the size of Texas, Oklahoma, Nevada and Utah combined, yet there are hundreds of villages and towns in which the inhabitants have never seen a wheeled vehicle of any sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Roads are in process of building, and there is a national road conscription law establishing compulsory road service for all males between the ages of sixteen and sixty years. At present there are about 2,500 miles of roads available for autos, of which 250 miles are considered good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As showing the effect of the construction of good roads, a road was recently paved leading back into a district inhabited almost exclusively by Indians. The year before the road was rebuilt 1,000 bags of potatoes came over it to market; in the year after it was rebuilt, 100,000 bags of potatoes came over the same road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Avenida Progreso, six miles long, connecting Lima and Callao is broad enough to accommodate eight motor cars abreast. It was opened up for public traffic in 1894.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first railroad in South America went into operation April 5, 1851. The Central Railway of Peru, the world's highest standard-guage railway, starts inland from the port of Callao, passes through Lima, climbs the western Andes and passes through the Calera tunnel at an altitude of 15,865 feet. A branch of this road at Morococha reaches an elevation of 17,000 feet, the highest point reached by a standard-guaged track.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The through inland route from Mollendo to Buenos Aires is broken by the 150-mile steamer trip on Lake Titicaca. This lake, 12,545 feet, above sea level, is the highest large lake in tlm world. Three steamers ply its waters between the port of Guiqui, Bolivia, and Puno, Peru. The Indian balsas that are the principal craft on Lake Titicaca have hulls which are made* of bundles of dried bulrushes. These quickly become water-logged and the boats must be hauled ashore frequently to be dried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from Lake Titicaca, Peru has some 3,000 to 4,000 miles of navigable rivers, all of them tributaries of the Amazon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Peruvian Cities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected in a thinly populated and decadent agricultural country, the cities are very small. Cuzco, the ancient capital, which is 10,500 feet above sea level, has a population of but 26,000. This city is the mecca of all the Indians in southern Peru. Experts can tell what district a visitor is from by the cut of his garments and the patterns used. 704 feet above the city of Cuzco is the ancient Inca fortress, Sacsayhuaman. Some of the stones in this structure are 30 feet long by 12 feet wide, and very thick. These huge stones are fitted together perfectly without mortar or cement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arequipa, on the railroad from the port of Mollendo to Lake Titicaca, is called the City of the Stars and is one of the loveliest places in Peru. It lies at an elevation of about 8,000 feet and a hundred miles inland from Mollendo in the Chile River valley. Its population is 48,000. Towering over the city at an altitude of 19,250 feet is the great El Misti volcano. This volcano often sends clouds of sulphurous vapor into the air or spurts hot water and steam from its half-mile-wide crater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mollendo, the port of Cuzco and Arequipa, has but 7,000 population, and though it is a port, it has no harbor at all. Even in calm weather the swell is so heavy that passengers must be lifted from the tender to the deck in a chair operated by a steam crane. There are days when the captain of the port is obliged to exercise his power to stop all communication between ships and shore. Nevertheless, despite these conditions, this port handles a large amount of commerce consisting of hides, wool and various kinds of minerals that originate in southeastern Peru and in Bolivia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peru has another port, if either of them may be called such, which is as rough as Mollendo; that is, Salavery. This, like Mollendo, is little more than a roadstead, and owes its activities to the fact that there are extensive rice and sugar cane lands in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The principal port of Peru is Callao, with a population of 53,000, and the port of Lima, the capital, which latter has a population of 250,000. Callao has one of the finest harbors on the Pacific. The largest steamers discharge freight directly on the wharves. The island of San Lorenzo and two long breakwaters provide a large body of protective water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lima was the capital of all South America long before the issuance of our own Declaration of Independence. The mummy of Pizarro is shown to all visitors in the cathedral in Lima.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Peruvian Commerce and Finance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are nearly a thousand post offices, so that the country is quite well provided with postal facilities. AIa.il between the United States and Peru may be transmitted between the two countries at the rate prevailing for domestic matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Foreign investments aggregate $400,000,000, of which $250,000,000 represents American capital and half that amount British capital. The British own most of the railways; the Americans control the copper’ and the vanadium mines and the oil wells. Before the World War, British trade with Peru was greater than that of the United States, France and Germany combined; but these conditions have changed and the United States now buys 35 percent of Peru's exports, and supplies 39 percent of her imports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swedish Match Company pays $800,000 a year for twenty years for the exclusive right to manufacture and sell matches. As a consequence matches sell at five times the price charged elsewhere, and matches made by any other company are not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Agricultural laborers are paid forty to fifty cents a day, and city workers about $1.00 a day. The standard of living of the working class is of necessity pitifully low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unit of currency is the libra or gold pound sterling of $4.8065, and the tenth part thereof the gold sol. One sol has 100 centavos, making the centavo worth a little less than half a cent.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Influence of the Church</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As already stated, the operation of the Roman Catholic church has been to the disadvantage of the Peruvian people. Many of the lands which belonged to them were sequestrated to the church, and this sequestration is still going on. As everywhere, the church has backed the aristocracy against the people and has consorted with the land-owning and military classes to keep the common people in subjection and to keep them so busy trying to make a living that they will not have time to worry over the liberties and blessings they have lost or to think about the curses they have received in exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> tells us that years ago among the Spanish priests there was a custom (though we presume not of any general application), when wedding fees dropped off, to herd the young people of the village, even down to twelve or thirteen years of age, into a room in the church, lock them in for the night, and in the morning, as they passed out in pairs, one priest married them, while another collected fees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The children have no toys and live a playless childhood. As soon as a child is able to walk it is set to work, and it is not uncommon to see a three-year-old child collecting firewood or driving the sheep or rendering some other service such as would be possible for a child of such tender years. Ten years ago the working hours of textile workers were from six o’clock in the morning until midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Roman Catholicism is the religion of the state. All churches and convents belong to the state, and the government appropriates annually about $100,000 for the maintenance of public worship.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Political and Educational</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Voting is compulsory, but is limited to the literate, so that the number of qualified voters is only about 5 percent of the population. 2V curious provision is that those who are married, even though under the normal voting age of 21 years, are entitled to vote, provided they can read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The president holds office for a term of five years, and may be reelected for one additional term. There is a senate and chamber of deputies corresponding with the American Senate and House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alilitary service is universal and compulsory; two years in the active army and thirty years in the three reserves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most ancient university in the New World is that of San Marcos, at Lima, founded in 1551. The University of Cuzco was founded in 1598, and the college at Arequipa in 1616, four years before the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth. Primary schools are of two classes : common and vocational. Elementary instruction is free and “compulsory” for children between the ages of seven and fourteen years. In Lima school luncheons are provided for the children of the poor and a fresh air school takes care of the children threatened with tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besides the road conscription law which exacts two weeks of road service each year from each adult male and without any compensation, there is also a special kind of forced, unpaid domestic service to the landlords for several weeks every year. This enforced personal servitude known in Peru and Bolivia as “pongeaje”, though abolished by law, is actually enforced for the landlords by the local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tenants of big landowners not only are forced to give unpaid, personal service to the landlord, but are forbidden to leave the landowner's district. Peasants working on the estates of big landowners are paid in products of the soil, ami almost never see any currency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Peru’s Era of High Finance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is only a little more than a year since Peru closed an era of eleven years of high finance by the overthrow and imprisonment of President Augusto B. Leguia after a period of virtual dictatorship. A sergeant in the Peruvian army in the war with Chile, later an insurance salesman, and eventually president of Peru from 1909 to 1912, President Leguia in the latter year went into voluntary exile, but made good use of his time principally in New York and other financial centers, forming acquaintances with American financiers who were disposed to invest millions in Peru provided the country would be adequately developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On July 4, 1919, President Leguia returned, seized the government, and ruled the country as virtual dictator until the time of his overthrow August 25, 1930. It is not believed even by President Leguia’s enemies that he was corrupt or that he sought other than Peru’s best welfare. When he seized the reins of government, the foreign debt was $12,000,000. At the time of his overthrow it was more than nine times as much. The money was spent in the sanitation of thirty-one Peruvian cities, the reorganization of the army and navy, the reconstruction of the educational system, the reopening of huge irrigation works, and the stamping out of yellow fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That he thought he was making himself the savior of his country is evidenced by the fact that he had busts and life-sized statues of himself erected in nearly every hamlet of the republic and had himself presented with gold medals and testimonials galore. Ue left behind him some splendid concrete boulevards in regions sparsely settled by the very poor. No doubt somebody will get the benefit of these boulevards in due time, but so far the principal benefactors were the contractors who built them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About 500,000 hectares (1,235,500acres) of oil land were handed over to the Standard Oil Co. Peruvian statesmen who objected to this policy were deported, without trial, to the barren island of San Lorenzo, to which island Leguia himself was sent by bis captors as soon as the hard times in the New York stock market made it impossible for him to get any more money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The claim is made by some of Leguia’s enemies that he cannot deny that his children and relatives and friends received millions of dollars as commissions and profits on the foreign loans and public works contracts. It is believed that he also was well aware of the fact that his children were heavily interested in the public gambling houses which during his tenure of office were open in all parts of the republic, an evil which he legalized by an amendment to the constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If it had not been for a falling off in the world demand for sugar, cotton, wool, petroleum and copper, Leguia would probably still be in office, for he would still be able to borrow money in New York. Nevertheless, it is believed that his prestige was seriously injured by the Tacna-Arica controversy with Chile, which was settled in a way considered inimical to Peru's interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Leguia was in power, Americans administered the Peruvian customs service, ran the Peruvian navy and aviation corps, administered tax collections, and drew up Peru’s budget. Legislation suggested by Americans favoring the exploitation of oil fields and cop-pei’ mined by American companies to the detriment of Peru’s interests was enacted. Virtually all American industries were almost entirely exempt from taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Toward the latter part of his tenure of office Leguia was drawing away from the people whose interests he had first championed and always claimed to champion, and was taking steps to turn the entire government of the country over to the Roman church. Thereupon the. people turned against him, and uprisings in Ijima and Arequipa put an end to his official career in two days’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Leguia was in office freedom of the press was entirely abolished; only newspapers supporting his dictatorship could be published. And while, for the sake of appearance, parliament was maintained, only candidates designated in advance by Leguia could be elected to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How evident it is that a great future awaits Peru! It has all the resources of field, forests, minerals, scenery and climate that the heart could wish. It needs only the just and generous constructive and forceful reign of earth’s new King to make of it one of the delights of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Mooney Case in a Nutshell</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">E CANNOT attempt to equal Mayor</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Walker’s eloquent and moving appeal for a pardon for Mooney, but we can state the whole case in a nutshell. F. C. Oxman, cattleman and perjurer, known to have been standing in the Woodland (Yolo County, California) railroad station at 2: OG p.m., July 22, 191G, swore that at the moment he was at the corner of Steuart and Market Sts.. San Francisco, 110 miles away, where he saw Mooney take a suitcase, supposedly with a bomb in it, over to Steuart Street. That particular perjury, devised, aided and abetted by private detective Swanson, District Attorney Fickert and Police Officer Draper Hand, condemned Mooney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is all there is to it. and in fifteen years California has not been able to elect a governor with the honesty or backbone to face the single fact contained in that sentence. It was on that evidence that Mooney was sentenced to be hanged. Everything else about the case is irrelevant and immaterial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As fai’ as Oxman’s whereabouts at the time are concerned, they are perfectly established. He had luncheon that day with a cattleman, Earl K. Hatcher, and his wife, near Woodland, Calif. They drove him to the 2:15 p.m. train. That Oxman wrote to a Mr. Rigall in Illinois and wanted him to come to San Francisco and swear perjuriously that he met Oxman there on the day of the explosion is also a fact. Oxman is dead, and ought to be. He was not the only perjurer in the case; there were others, but their lies were unimportant. It was Oxman’s testimony that convicted Mooney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Griffin, who tried Mooney, has said that “every witness who testified against Mooney has been shown, by facts and circumstances developed since his trial and which are incontrovertible, to have testified falsely. There is now no evidence against him; there is not a serious suggestion that any exists’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thirty witnesses, and eight photographs taken by three different photographers from three different positions, show that four minutes before the explosion took place Mooney was on the top of the Eilers Building, a mile and a quarter away, viewing the parade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Captain Duncan Matheson, who assembled the evidence for the prosecution, the foreman of the jury that tried the case, all the living members of the jury, the attorney general of the state, the warden of the prison where he is confined, and honest editors and jurists all over the land have expressed their opinions that here is one of the grossest cases of injustice ever perpetrated. The editors of the Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Suu,</span><span class="font6"> the San Francisco </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Call-Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News, </span><span class="font6">the Chicago </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> and the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Worlil-Telegrani</span><span class="font6"> feel about the matter as we do, and the number is increasing. The only reason Mooney remains in prison is that Big Business as represented by United Railways in San Francisco has decided he must so remain, and all of California’s governors and her supreme court justices too, and all the electors of the state are in contempt of the whole civilized world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Copy of My Letter to Governor Rolph </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Mary Mooney</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Written from St. Joseph's Hospital, San Francisco)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governor James Rolph, Jr.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">State Capitol,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sacramento, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Goveuxor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sure and I'm sick and in the hospital or I'd come to see you meself to talk to you about my son, Tom Mooney, so I’m writin’ you this letter. In all the long years since my boy was in prison, I've never bothered any governors, as I thought ’twould look like I wanted pity and I didn't and don't want any now. And I want my boy to get a square deal like any other man, and it’s up to you to give it to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governor Rolph, 1 came to this country from old Ireland before you was born. I’ve lived here over sixty years. I raised my children to be honest. Our whole family was hard-workin’ people. Tom was the oldest child; he worked his head off to help the rest of us. Mis father died when Tom was a small boy. He never in his life did anything that wasn't honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sure, 'twas because ho was honest and a brave boy and stood up like a man to fight for his own people, the workin’ people, that they framed on him and party near hanged him. Faith, and I'm proud of my son because he wouldn't sell himself to nobody for money or an easy job. That's the way I brought him up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My son was framed on by the corporashuns because he fought for the workin’ people. They wanted him out of the way. Take the main witness in the case: Oxman. Sure and I told the scoundrel when he was walkin’ out of the court after he swore my boy’s life away for a few dollars, “You’re lyin’ on my boy and tryin’ to put the rope around his neck, but faith, with the help of God you'll never do it.<sup>-</sup>’ lie never answered me, but hung his head for shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You're the fourth governor since my boy went to jail and his party black hair turned gray. He became an old man in jail. Sure and it's the sixteenth Christmas he'll be spendin’ in jail. Mayor Walker, God bless him, was sure, my boy would get out for Christmas. He said to Tom, “Your mother's got a new son.” I hoped and prayed that he'd be out by Christmas, like all them other boys you're lettin' out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now it looks like you're usin’ my boy for a football like all the other governors did. You kick him to Air. Sullivan and 1 guess he’ll kick him back to you. You say it’ll take three or four months to look over the facts. Faith, and it makes me old Irish heart sick to hear that old blarney. Sure any schoolboy could know all the facts in three or four hours. And you were mayor when it happened and marched in the parade and sure should know all the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three or four months might not be long for you, Governor, or for Air. Sullivan, but it's a long time for me what's been waitin’ for over fifteen years and for my boy what’s had almost sixteen years stolen from his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governor Rolph, I’m over eighty years old. Faith, and I'm sick; my eyesight is failin’ but my mind’s clear. I don’t care about meself. I ask you in the name of all that's just and holy to let my boy out. Sure and I’m too sick to go see my boy. I hope and pray for a pardon so my boy can come and see me and put bis arms around me a free man before it’s too late. Free my boy and get the blessin’ of an old Irish mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alotherly yours,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE ruling factors in Canada have combined together in an effort to force prosperity, but they realize the fact that there is little hope of deceiving the people into believing prosperity is here so long as there are hundreds of thousands unemployed. A survey of the happenings of the last parliamentary session gives some idea of the Government’s effort to deal with the problems facing Canada, particularly that of the unemployed. In this connection we quote from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian Magazine:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Measures for Public Relief</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Faced with national unemployment and rural distress of unprecedented magnitude, Parliament, by legislation, gave the Government blanket authority to meet both problems. Since the full extent of the need could not become evident until late autumn, the ministry was unable to give Parliament any definite information upon the amount of money required. Informed opinion places the figure at $70,000,000, of which $20,000,000 will be required for farm relief in the West, and $50,000,000 for unemployment generally. The Government may spend more or less; there were no strings attached to the power given Mr. Bennett by Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The relief scheme was outlined to Parliament by the prime minister. All relief expenditures will be met out of borrowed capital, not current revenue. Authority to spend money will lapse on March 31, 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government will attack rural distress by creating a relief area in the drought-stricken parts of the West. This area will comprise all of southern Saskatchewan. Administration will be carried on by commission, and whatever money necessary to carry the tens of thousands of destitute farmers through the winter, maintaining them on their farms, providing sustenance for man and beaist, seed grain for the new crop, this will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">General unemployment will be met by four policies:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. There will be a national program of public ■works, to be paid for entirely by the Dominion. These works will comprise all manner of public buildings, wharfs, breakwaters, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. There will be a program of works to be carried out by municipalities and provinces with the financial assistance of the Dominion. This was done last autumn, following the September session, but this year the federal government will bear a greater share of the cost. The responsibility of formulating the program will lie with provincial governments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The Canadian Red Cross will be given money to clothe and feed all destitute women and children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. The federal government will bear a larger share of direct relief than was the case last year.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>The Farmer Hard Hit</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">With depression on every hand people in all walks of life are giving much thought to the situation and some are gradually awakening to the fact that prosperity cannot come from robbing the farmer. Speaking of this awakening the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font6"> editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is gradually dawning on the Dominion that, while continuous efforts have been made to meet the emergency of city populations, the farmers of Canada have suffered a disastrous collapse in their sources of revenue and are seriously embarrassed. Today the food producers are surfeited with goods which are salable only at ruinous prices, city people in their reduced employment and often lower' wages have decreased buying power, which, in turn, reacts on the farmers. Thus the “vicious circle” is at work again and the farmer is caught in its relentless movement. He cannot buy as he did, he is forced to forego necessaries of life, and from his emergency the merchants and manufacturers are likewise victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the farmer suffers, all must suffer. Despite our multiform activities in urban industry agriculture is still the chief, and the well-being of our country rests ultimately on our wheat fields. If they fail us, everything bears the mark of that failure, and everything tends toward ruin. It is a thought which should sober us people in the cities and towns of the Dominion. Sometimes we are inclined to think that our industry and commerce are the heart and hub of our civilization; sometimes we are apt to think that the energies of our great merchants, financiers and business men are the foundation rocks upon which the business structure must rest. Far, far from it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The farmer not only provides our food, but his contact with the soil brings new wealth into being. Compared with him, the city man is a middleman, a trader, one whose very activity and profit depends on the success of the primary industries, such as farming, mining and fishing. No one, therefore, can remain indifferent to the position of the primary producer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are all familiar with the disastrous slump in the price of wheat, upon which the prosperity of a large part of the Dominion is dependent. We know, too, that fruit and vegetables arc cheap, and we hear of loads of farm produce that scarcely find a market. It is only when we compare prices that we realize the extent of the blow from which the farmer is suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past two years, ever since the slump which was heralded by the crash in the stock market in the fall of 1929, there has been weakness in commodity prices. While copper, cotton, silver and other articles not directly related to agriculture have tumbled in value, the products of the farm have taken a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">similar course. We may delay building a house, or buying clothes or a silver service, but we must have food, the output of the farms. Yet the farmers’ products have felt the decline, and those who depend on farmers’ patronage have felt the consequent reaction. Here is a table of comparative prices of first-quality products on the Toronto markets since the stock crash:</span></p>

But there is an individual in Montreal who is probably still in search of information ; she is a member of the chorus of elevator girls who relieve the monotony of vertical transportation in one of the city’s largest office buildings.

<p><span class="font6">That the white man is most wanton in the destruction of that which the Lord has so abundantly supplied is brought to our attention in the following item culled from the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Telegram:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is described as one of the most romantic tasks in the world is the labor of love undertaken by Grey Owl in the new Riding Mountain Park in Manitoba. The bearer of this picturesque name is an Indian of high culture who has specialized in the ways and habits of the wild life in which the great reserves of Canada abound, and by the systematic devotion of his talent and his pen he is contributing nobly to the preservation of such animals as the beaver. They come at his call, they take food from his hands, and he is revealing to the world at large the secrets of one of the most wonderful of all living creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose he has in view, coupled with a melancholy prophecy which one hopes will be disproved, is admirably summed up in his own words: “It seems a crying shame,” he writes, “that these animals should have been slaughtered to the point almost of extinction. They are just going the way of the buffalo. But their stumps, houses, dams and all their work will long remain against man for his shameful waste in the exploitation of the wild lands and the dwellers therein. Many a useful short cut on a circuitous canoe route, of great assistance in the proper ranging of valuable forests against fire, has become impracticable since the beaver was removed, as the dams fell out of repair and the smaller lakes and rivers became too shallow for navigation. Soon all that will remain of this once numerous clan of Little Brethren of the Waste Places will be their representative in his place of honor on the flag of Canada.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Father Pathe declared that the world today was rushing drunkenly into paganism and was falling back into the condition where its womanhood would be degraded and manhood weakened. He claimed there were Roman Catholic young women who told their confessors that they were unable to find a single Roman Catholic young man who had respect for womanhood and that in future they would look for lovers outside of the faith to be fathers to their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Outside of the Catholic church,” he said, “the fundamental law of nature and of God is cast out. But it is sadder still to have to acknowledge that inside the church matters are not much better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In our ranks the disregard of the law of God in the sixth commandment is so bad that leaders in the church are pitilessly helpless to stem the tide of immorality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Catholic young manhood of today is as a class bending down to a filth of public practice that degraded the young manhood in the days of the Roman Empire. The average young man who has finished his schooling and has gone out into ordinary work has an idea that a woman is made for no other purpose than to satisfy the beast that lives in his uncultured heart. He is not at a loss for women who will live his way.</span></p>

The fact that Manchuria is now and is likely to remain virtually a Japanese protectorate is in itself of small moment.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Panama Canal Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford recently passed through the Panama Canal, and sent us some data of this great enterprise, published by the Government, from which we glean the following facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is believed that in ancient geologic times there was a natural channel here, but earthquakes, still prevalent along the western coast of the Americas, threw up a ridge which, at the place where the canal crosses, was 312 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The digging of the canal required the removal of dirt equivalent to fill a hole 15% feet square right through the center of the earth, from pole to pole, and involved the construction of a dam a mile and a half long which is half a mile wide at its base. When tropical storms burst upon the isthmus there are occasions when more than a solid foot of water falls within a day. Gatun dam is built to withstand just such sudden falls of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the place selected for the canal the distance between the short's was 3-1 miles. The route taken by the canal, up the valley of the Chagres river and down the* valley of the Rio Grande, makes the length from shore line to shore line 40 miles. The distances from deep water to deep water art; ten miles greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The surface of Gatun lake is 85 feet above the Atlantic ocean. Three double locks, each 1,000 feet long step the largest vessels up and down on the Atlantic side. These locks are 110 feet wide and 70 feet deep and are capable of handling any vessel afloat. The Atlantic entrance to the canal is 331Z&gt; miles north and 27 miles west of the Pacific entrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gatun dam, heretofore referred to, slopes gently to its summit, 105 feet above sea level. Its gradually sloping sides, a mile and a half long and half a mile wide, have been planted with grass and shrubbery and are the site of an 18-hole golf course. The spillway of this dam is 808 feet long, and the spillway channel itself is 285 feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The width of the canal channel is 500 feet, by not less than 42 feet deep; in the Culebra cut the width is 300 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though the normal level of the Pacific ocean is but 8 inches above that of the Atlantic, yet there are times when the tidal variation is as high as 21 feet; hence a lock would be necessary for safe navigation; and by putting three locks at each end of the canal it became unnecessary to cut a channel 85 feet deep for a distance of 32 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present capacity of the canal is 48 ships per day. There is every known convenience for repair of vessels, and the supplying of them with coal, fuel oil, water, foods of all kinds, ice, and what not. The large dry dock can receive any ship afloat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As early as 1520, navigators began to talk of making a strait where the canal now lies. <sup>r</sup>rhe French began operations January 20, 1882, and the Americans on May 4, 1904. The first ocean steamer passed through on August 3, 1914, the day Germany declared war against France, and the day the king of the Belgians appealed to King George of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The average ship pays about $-1,300 in tolls for transit through the canal. This figures out at something like 65 cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, and if a ship can save over six days of time it is always profitable for her to use the canal. Reduced to mileage, this is fixed at 1,440 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The canal is now operated to about one-third of its capacity. The tolls pay all expenses of operation and return about $18,000,000 a year, which is something inure than the interest charge of 3 percent on the $535,743,840 invested. The operation of the canal and the extensive adjuncts of railroad, hotels, and other features necessary to make it a first-class enterprise necessitates the employment of approximately 3,300 Americans and 12,000 other workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">230 Poisoned at Overbrook</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS the boast of the aluminum cooking utensil people that nearly all the hospitals of the country cook their food in nothing else. So far, so good. That is to say, so far so good for the aluminum utensil business, as a business. It makes a good advertisement to be able to say that your salesmen have been bright enough to crowd your wares into all the hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But it is awfully embarrassing to try to keep out of the papers the constantly recurring items that people by the hundred are being stricken in those same hospitals and that the doctors, those wise men, are never able to find out what it was that made the victims ill. The only thing the doctors are sure of is that hundreds are suddenly made ill, and 'aluminum is not to blame’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Wednesday, December 16, at the Overbrook Hospital for the Insane, Newark, N. J., they had a Christmas dinner containing chicken salad, minced ham, fruits and ices, and out of 280 guests all but about 50 were taken ill two hours after the feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the authorities did not know and never will know what it was that made all these people sick. The superintendent of the institution, Dr. Guy Payne, said that the fowl used in the salad appeared to be in good condition, and we have to say frankly that we are thoroughly well convinced that Dr. Payne has told the truth, and that there was really nothing the matter with the food itself. The whole difficulty we can well surmise is to be traced to the utensils in which it was cooked and in which the food was allowed to be stored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the newspaper reports we select a paragraph which explains just why the real cause of this wholesale poisoning will never be found. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Albert Edel, toxicologist, is analyzing samples of food eaten at the party and yesterday reported his examination thus far shows there were no metallic poisons in the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kind friend, that is all there is to tell. Without a doubt in the world all those people were made sick because the food was made and stored in alumimun utensils; and now thou knowest the uses of a toxicologist. It is his duty to rush quickly into print and to make it clear to the public that there has been no metallic poisoning of food. That is so that more aluminum utensils may be sold to yet other asylums. His duties end right there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, the same newspaper that assures us that “there were no metallic poisons in the food’’ also contains in one line the declaration by O. O. McIntyre that “nine hundred were poisoned by food at a bank executive luncheon two months ago; it did not reach the newspapers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We suppose that many of those executives would be willing to writhe in agony rather than see aluminum shares go down; but, on the other hand, it would be a little hard to get nine hundred of them to all see the light at one time, and we honestly think that unless the doctors turn about face and begin to tell the facts about the dangers of cooking in aluminum there arc sorry times ahead for some of them when the truth actually leaks out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Conspiracy Against God’s Anointed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By R. H. Barber, Bethel</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6"> PAPER called “Witness Bulletin” and published by Norman Woodworth has been given wide circulation among </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">subscribers. So has P. S. L. Johnson’s paper called “Present Truth”. Both of these papers carry an emphatic denial of the warning given in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> that the hypocritical clergy and the “man of sin” are now forming a conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses in the earth. They both assert, with emphasis, that they know of no such conspiracy and are having no part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has resulted in many questions’ being asked by Jehovah’s witnesses, as to how these statements and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> presentations can be harmonized. These questions led me to a more careful study of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> articles and the scriptures on this subject, with the following results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following texts </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">foretell</span><span class="font6"> such a conspiracy, locate it at the time when Jehovah sets His King on His holy hill, Zion, and assure these “witnesses” that the conspiracy is doomed to an ignominious failure, and with dire consequences to the conspirators, namely, their everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psalm 2:1-9: “The. kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, .. . yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. ... I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance. . . . Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” Again, in Psalm 35:4-8, we read: “Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. ... let the angel of the Lord chase them. . . • For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.” (This reminds us that Haman was hanged on the very gallows which he had built for others.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psalm 83: 2-5, also, warns of this coming conspiracy. It reads: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones [hidden in the secret place of the Most High]. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation [the holy nation] : that the name of Israel [the Israel of God] may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate [a conspiracy] against thee.” Verse seventeen tells of Jehovah’s purpose. to destroy these conspirators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isaiah mentions this conspiracy, in chapter eight, verses nine to fifteen. It reads: “Associate yourselves, . . . and ye shall be broken in pieces: . . . Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">us. . . </span><span class="font6">. Say ye not, A confederacy [a conspiracy], to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy [a conspiracy]; . . . and many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be. snared, and be taken.” Matthew 24:48-51 also mentions this conspiracy in the following words: “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, . . . the lord of that servant [“evil servant”, the “man of sin”] shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, . . . and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites [the hypocritical clergy class].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, in Matthew 24:24, we are told of “false Christs” whose purpose is to “deceive the very elect”. In 2 Peter 2:1-3 we read again of these conspirators, as follows: “There, shall be false teachers </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">among</span><span class="font6"> you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, . . . and many [spirit-begotten ones] shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">way of truth</span><span class="font6"> shall be evil spoken of. And . . . they [shall] with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment . . . lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.” Still again, in 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12 we read of a “lawless one”, called the “man of sin” and the ‘son of destruction’, who opposes, and exalts himself; who will be manifested during the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font6"> of Jesus Christ; who will be under Satan’s pow’er and control, and show “signs and lying wonders”, and will deceive those that are lost. This text reveals that the “man of sin” was once associated with the anointed; that he fell away, and became “lawless” and a liar and a deceiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The entire book of Esther is a great drama, picturing this conspiracy and its utter failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So also, the conspiracy which resulted in Jesus’ death is an illustration of a greater conspiracy in our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A careful study of the Esther conspiracy and the one against Jesus reveals that the hypocritical clergy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">initiated</span><span class="font6"> the conspiracy, and that the government or civil rulers were duped or tricked into becoming parties to the same. This was true of both Ahasuerus and Pilate. This proves that the clergy element of Satan’s visible organization is more wicked than are the financial and political elements. But, wicked as were those hypocritical Pharisees and scribes, there was another who was far more wicked, corrupt and repulsive. His name was Judas, the “man of sin” and the “son of perdition” so necessary to the success of that first conspiracy. These wicked needed his assistance in connection with the success of their plot, and they got it for thirty pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the one who had been the intimate friend of Jesus, who had eaten bread at the. same table, and who had been in line for the Kingdom, became a traitor. From these facts we learn that the conspiracy against Jehovah’s anointed in our day will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">originate</span><span class="font6"> with the clergy, and that in some way they will deceive the governments into becoming a party to the same, and then to make their scheme successful, the Judas class, the “man of sin” will appear as a coconspirator with the hypocrites. This act of betrayal will occur before Armageddon, and the conspiracy will be a failure, because the governments will learn that they have been duped or tricked into becoming parties to the conspiracy. When they learn of the duplicity and hypocrisy of the clergy element, they will turn upon these hypocrites and rend them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is shown by the fact that King Ahasuerus turned upon Haman, who pictured all the conspirators, both the hypocritical clergy and the “man of sin”. It is also shown in Revelation 17:16,17, which reads thus: “And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the [wild] beast, these shall hate the whore [the ecclesiastical wing of the Devil's organization], and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.” Thus seen, the “man of sin” will come into the picture later; he will be hanged upon the gallows of his own making, be caught in the net which he set for others, and have his portion with the hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In giving us this warning through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toicer</span><span class="font6"> the Lord is only fulfilling His promise to show us “things to come”. However, while the “betrayal” is evidently in the future, nevertheless, the consistent and deliberate effort of those who have separated from the company of God’s anointed, to cause division among the same, and thus alienate from their number all they possibly can, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is a conspiracy</span><span class="font6"> “against the Lord and against his anointed”. Such efforts are being made at the present time, and have been made in the past. Thus there is a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">present </span><span class="font6">conspiracy on the part of the “man of sin”. Letters and magazines are mailed to the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses for the deliberate purpose of causing confusion in their ranks, and opposing and hindering the work they are doing. Radio broadcasts are put on the air at the very moment that the Watchtower electrical transcriptions go on the air, for the same, deliberate purpose of causing confusion and division. If this is not conspiracy, please tell us what conspiracy is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It matters not whether these deny that this is intended as a conspiracy. The facts are there, and cannot be disputed, that a studied, persistent and deliberate effort is being made to cause confusion and division among Jehovah’s witnesses. If these opposers do not believe that we are Jehovah’s witnesses, we </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">knoiv</span><span class="font6"> that we are, and therefore their efforts are “against the Lord and his anointed”. Judas may not have realized that he was a party to a conspiracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">epresentative Loring M. Black, of Brooklyn, in demanding an investigation of the narcotic service, alleges that a high official of the Treasury department balked the New York federal grand jury in its efforts to complete an investigation which had already disclosed widespread incompetency and corruption, and de</span><span class="font6">clares that in another case, when evidence was presented to Washington that one narcotic agent was suspected of selling seized dope, not only was there no investigation made, but the investigating agent was discouraged from presenting the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is Your God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6"> GOD is one who possesses or is supposed to possess superhuman and supernatural powers. It is natural for mankind to worship some god, and the kind of god that they worship depends largely on their environment, education and training. Men worship a god because. they believe that he is worthy and deserving of their reverence and veneration, and that in some way he is responsible for their existence and controls their present and future destinies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of people ascribe superhuman and supernatural powers to images of wood, stone, gold and silver; others ascribe such powers to snakes, oxen, cows, the sun, the moon, and the stars; some reverence souvenirs of wood or old bones; the ancient Greeks had their gods of the sea, of fire, of war, and of the day and of the night. Man was born with an instinctive desire to worship something. Reverence and veneration are qualities possessed by all normal men and women. These qualities are God-given, and intended to be exercised toward their great Creator, Jehovah God, who is in every way deserving of the worship and reverence of His creatures. Losing faith in Jehovah God, doubting His existence, and neglecting to study His Word, men gradually lose all proper conception of the majesty of the great Creator; and having this inborn desire to reverence and worship something, they naturally turn to idol worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blinded to the majesty of Jehovah, by their neglecting to study His Word, people came to worship the created things rather than the Creator, and ascribed superhuman powers to these created things. Paul mentions this tendency, in Romans 1: 25, saying: “Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.” The terrible degradation which resulted from a worship of false gods is described in detail by Paul in verses 20 to 30 of this chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ignorance of the only true God, and a superstitious fear that they must worship and propitiate some god or be forever tormented, led mankind to make gods with their own hands and to ascribe to these the powers and qualities which they supposed a god should possess. Thus a multiplicity of gods came to be recognized. The natural tendency of ignorant, fallen mankind is toward a multiplicity of gods. The Greeks recognized many gods, but fearing that they had omitted one, they foolishly erected an altar to “the unknown god”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible declares that there is but one God, and that His name is Jehovah; it claims that He is supreme, self-existent, all-wise and allpowerful ; that He is eternal, and the source of all life, both intelligent and unintelligent; that He is the creator, sustainer and ruler of the universe and everything in it; that He is the giver of every good and perfect gift, and hence, is worthy of the reverence, the love, the service and worship of all His creatures. If Jehovah possesses all these qualities, attributes and powers, it must be admitted that He is worthy of worship and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what does it mean to worship God? It means to have respect for, admiration for and praise for Him; it means to love and serve Him; to recognize and acknowledge His excellencies, and as far as possible to exalt Him both by word and deed; it means to acknowledge Him as the author of our being, and hence our Father; and to acknowledge Him as our protector, counselor and our deliverer. When the children of Israel had turned from God and were worshiping idols, the Prophet Jeremiah said of them: “The house of Israel is ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, their priests and their prophets, saying to a stock, thou art our father; and to a stone, thou hast brought me forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Professing Christian people laugh and scoff at the gold, silver and wooden gods of the heathen, because they realize their utter helplessness. Yet the blinded and ignorant heathen honestly believes that his god possesses supernatural powers and is worthy of his worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The heathen conception of a god is that he must be vindictive and cruel, and therefore must be appeased with some sacrifice; and history records the fact that the lives of millions of men, women and children have been taken to appease these blind, deaf and dumb gods. Millions of children have been cast into the Ganges river to appease some mythical god who was supposed to live in its waters. Iron furnaces like human forms have been constructed and thousands of infants have been placed in its red-hot arms and burned to death, while relatives and neighbors beat tom-toms to drown the cries of the sufferer, in order to appease some god that did not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible mentions the names of some of the gods and goddesses which the ancients worshiped, among which are Baal and Ashtaroth, Molech, the queen of heaven, and Diana of the Ephesians. All Christians know full well that these are mythical gods; in other words, that there are no such gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christian people ridicule these crude conceptions of a god, and wonder at the ignorance and superstition which impels a heathen to worship them. Of course, Satan himself is the author of all these misconceptions of God and His attributes. His purpose in foisting such false, ideas on the people is to belittle the great Jehovah God; to heap reproach upon Him; to belittle everything religious, and to so disgust people with God and religion that they will turn away from God, away from the Bible, and thus will the more readily become his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But while Christian people have ridiculed the ignorance and stupidity of the heathen and their idolatrous worship, and have considered it their bounden duty to convert them to the service and worship of the true God, yet it has remained for professing people to give to the world three different conceptions of God, which, if possible, are more foolish and ridiculous than the heathen conception. Christian people also ascribe to their God, the great Jehovah, attributes which are as wicked, vindictive and vicious as those which the Heathen gods are supposed to possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of Christian people have a conception of God which is summed up in the phrase “the triune God”, by which term they mean three gods in one. Such a god would be a hideous monstrosity. Just how they can be three and yet be one is acknowledged to be a mystery, but seemingly the theory has been that the greater the mystery, the more truth there is in it, and the more it is entitled to be reverenced. This theory, known as “the Trinity”, assumes that Jehovah God and His Son, our Lord Jesus, are one and the same person, and that, in some unexplainable way, a third person, called “the holy ghost”, is also a part of this “God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People talk glibly about the “trinity” as though it were a reasonable and proven theory, and as though the Bible had much to say about it. However, the Bible is absolutely silent about a “trinity”, and there are no words in the Bible that can possibly be construed to mean a “trinity”, or three gods in one. The theory is so unreasonable that it is positively foolish, and in dozens of different ways the Bible shows that the theory is utterly false. It is nothing less than another effort put forth by Satan to belittle Jehovah God; to make Him appear ridiculous and the laughingstock of intelligent creatures. Christian people need to stop ridiculing the heathen idea of God and investigate their own conception of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the Bible, God is the “father” and Jesus is the “son”, and any person who will think for one moment will realize that a “father” and his “son” cannot be one and the same person. This hideous three-in-one theory is even more foolish than the Japanese idea that there are 15,000,000 gods. In 1 Corinthians 8:4,6 we read: “To us there is but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font6"> God, the Father, of whom are all things, . . . and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.” In this text God and Jesus are mentioned as two separate and distinct persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If God and Jesus were one and the same person, then when Jesus died on the tree, the universe was without a God for three days, for it is written that Jesus was raised on the third day. (1 Cor. 15:4) In 2 John, verse 9, we read: “He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.” Jesus never taught that He was God or that He was equal with God, but in most positive language denied both suggestions, saying, “My father is greater than I.” (John 14:28) Again, He said: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:26,27) If God and Jesus were one and the same person, w<sup>T</sup>by should Jesus say that His Father had given to Him life and authority?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said: “I always do those things which please my Father.” Again, He said: “I came . . . not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me,” and on the tree He cried out, saying: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” In all of these texts Jesus acknowledged God as His Father and as His superior in every respect. There are hundreds of similar texts, but there is not to be found in the Bible a single text that supports the idea of three gods in one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus also said: “I and my Father are one.” (John 10:30) This text is supposed to teach that they are one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in person,</span><span class="font6"> and is used to support the doctrine of the “trinity”. But the text does not support this doctrine. Jesus and His Father were one in work and effort. Jesus came to do the will of the Father, and He always did it. As proof that Jesus did not refer to a oneness of person, please notice that Jesus prayed to His Father that His disciples might be one with both Him and His Father. Jesus prayed thus: “I pray . . . that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they . . . may be one, even as we are one.” (John 17:20-22) Anyone should be able to see that if Jesus prayed that His disciples might be one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">even as He and His Father </span><span class="font6">were one, it has no reference to a oneness of person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Revelation 3:14 we are told that Jesus was created, and had a beginning. God was not created, and never had a beginning; for the Scriptures declare that He is “from everlasting to everlasting”. The terms “trinity”, “triune God,” and “three persons in one God” are not found in the Bible. Satan is their real author, and his purpose in coining them and foisting them on an unsuspecting public was and is to misrepresent God and to cast reproach on the Bible by charging it with teaching false and ridiculous doctrines, and to thus alienate people from the service of the one true and only living God. Besides being a wicked slander against God, the doctrine of the “trinity” is nonsensical and unreasonable. As long as Christian people believe this doctrine they should cease to criticize or condemn the poor ignorant heathen for their misconceptions of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In recent years Christian people are putting forth another equally erroneous and foolish conception of God which is rapidly being accepted as a correct theory by those who do not have confidence in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. This theory assumes that God is simply a “natural law”; that He is not a personal, intelligent being, and that every thing that exists came into existence by a blind force, called law. It not only denies that God is a personality, and that He has intelligence, but it strips God of His attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power; it denies that God can have such qualities as mercy, long-suffering, patience and forbearance; it denies that He can be grieved with sin; that He can think, reason and act; that He can hear the prayers of His people and answer the same; or that He will punish the wicked for wrong doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If God is simply a “natural law”, or a “good principle”, then it follows that He can do none of these things. If God were nothing but law or a principle, then it would be superlative nonsense to say that He is the Father of Jesus, and that Jesus is His Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are hundreds of thousands of people now living on earth who do not believe in a personal God, and Satan would like to get everybody not to believe it, if possible, and thus to deny the existence of a supreme, intelligent Creator. Those who deny the existence of a personal God also deny the existence of a personal Devil, and, not believing in the existence of a Devil, are, of course, off their guard, and open to his attacks. They are entirely unaware of the fact that Satan is wily, crafty, deceitful and cunning, and that his method of operation is to “blind the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">minds</span><span class="font6"> of them that believe not”. —2 Cor. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This text says that it is those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">believe not </span><span class="font6">whose minds are blinded; and it is manifest that if anyone is deceived, the deception must l&gt;e made through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mind.</span><span class="font6"> Satan’s method of leading people to oppose God is through an appeal to the mind; he suggests something to their minds. This appeal is usually an appeal to their fears, to their pride, to their ambition, to their love of good name, fame, friends; in short, an appeal to selfishness, and at once there comes to the mind a suggestion to follow a certain course or do a certain thing, or believe a certain doctrine, which satisfies their own selfish desire, and the deceived one is ignorant of the fact that Satan is the author of the suggestion. Particularly is this true if he does not believe in a personal Devil, and doubts that the Bible is the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still another conception of God is held by millions of people. They think of Him as being-cruel, vengeful and hateful. They charge Him with having created a place where wicked people will be tortured forever; with having created a wicked, hideous creature called the Devil whose work is to do the tormenting. This conception of God likewise robs Him of all His attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power, and makes of Him a being to be dreaded, despised and hated. Nobody could worship or love such a God. If anyone should serve Him he would do it from motives of fear, and not because he reverenced or considered Him deserving of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan is likewise the author of this degrading conception of God, and put it into the minds of the people for the purpose of belittling Him and prejudicing intelligent creatures against Him. This is the most successful way to turn people away from God and the Bible, and Satan is shrewd enough to discern this fact. Moreover, the deception is much more successful because it comes through the educated, the prominent and the influential people of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, let us ask ourselves the question propounded by our subject, Who is our God? Whom do we worship? Are we rendering the reverence and adoration of our hearts to the monstrosity God, the three-in-one God, the mysterious, unthinkable and impossible God? or are we devoting all our powers of mind and body and heart to the service of the devilish, fiendish, eternal-torment God, unmerciful, unloving, unjust and cruel? or are we serving the blind, deaf and dumb God, called “the God of nature”? Let us once and for ever put away these false conceptions of God, and let us take our instructions from the Scriptures, which picture to our minds a loving God; a God of mercy, patience and long-suffering; a God who hears and answers the prayer of His penitent creatures and who will forgive their sins and remember their sins no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us now examine what the Bible has to say about the true God. His name is Jehovah, and He is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font6"> God; Jesus is His Son; and the Bible is a book which He inspired holy men to write and which contains a revelation of His purposes toward mankind; He possesses the attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power, which He uses in wise, just, loving, benevolent ways, always to bless but never to injure His creatures; He is the author of various laws which are unchangeable, and which if obeyed always bring blessings, but if violated always bring a just and merited punishment. He asks His children to obey these laws, not for selfish purposes, nor simply to show His authority, but because obedience will bring blessings to His creatures and insure to them perfect liberty, perfect peace, perfect health, perfect happiness, and everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even in punishing His people for violating His law, God’s purpose is not selfish, but to teach them lessons which will be for their everlasting benefit, unless they are so obtuse that they refuse to profit by them. He does not punish simply to show His power and authority, but to teach His people what course is right and what one is wrong, and also to teach them the lesson that He will not permit a persistently wilful sinner to live. Paul said: “Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.” (Hebrews 12:11) Also, in verse 10 of the same chapter, he says that our earthly parents chasten us “after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has exercised His </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font6"> in the past, in creating all things that are in heaven and in earth, in condemning the first man to death for his disobedience; and in limiting the power of Satan and his agents at certain times, notably, by destroying the wicked race in Noah’s day; by the overthrow of Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; by the destruction of Israel’s enemies on several occasions; by delivering Job from his trials and giving him wonderful blessings thereafter, and by the deliverance of Daniel and the three Hebrews. He will exercise His </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">power </span><span class="font6">in the near future in binding the Devil for a thousand years, and destroying his wicked power over the race; and again, by resurrecting all that are in their graves, and giving everlasting life to all the willing and obedient; and still again, by utterly destroying all the willful and disobedient in everlasting destruction, called, in the Scriptures, “second death.” No sane man can object to such an exercise of power. There is nothing selfish in it. Jehovah did these things to vindicate His name, and to prove that He is the only true God and that all blessings come from Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has manifested His wisdom and love, in His purpose to give His creatures everlasting life on condition that they obey certain just and righteous laws. His wisdom is manifested again, in His determination to give eternal life, to no one except to those who appreciate it and who will not seek to abridge the right of others to enjoy the same privilege of everlasting life without fear or molestation. It is heavenly wisdom which has decreed that those who will menace the life, liberty or happiness of others shall not live, and that their punishment shall be everlasting destruction, and not eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Justice and love will cooperate with wisdom in the execution of these purposes, so that when all completed, no intelligent creature can condemn any feature of God's arrangement. When the divine purposes are understood it will be seen that God has never been unjust, unloving, selfish or cruel in His dealings with the children of men, but that He has always had at heart the very best interests of all His creatures. Then everybody will recognize the fact that He is worthy of our worship, adoration, praise and thanksgiving. Then men will recognize that God is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be the recognition of the fact that God is good, loving and merciful that will lead men to repent and come into harmony with His laws. Paul says: “Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?” (Rom. 2: 4) Ah, yes. Here is the secret of true repentance. To properly worship and reverence God one must learn that He is good and loving. No honest man can worship a God who he believes will torment one of His creatures forever. He may dread Him; he may despise Him; but worship Him, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people who believe in the doctrine of eternal torment claim to worship and reverence Jehovah God. The real truth is that they dread Him, and hence cannot properly worship Him. We see these same people violating His laws every day, and a man who habitually violates God’s laws deceives himself when he says that he loves God. Love is appreciative, grateful and responsive, and the man who claims to love God and is not grateful for the blessings which he receives at His hands daily, and does not render his thanks and give his praises daily is professing a lie. To worship God acceptably one must have a propel<sup>1</sup> conception of His attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very plainly we are told what kind of worship God will accept, and how anyone must worship Him. He does not want a hypocritical worship, nor does He want anyone to worship Him because one dreads Him. In John 4:23, 24 we read: “The hour cometh . . . when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” This means that the time will come when everybody will know the truth about God; when all misconceptions and misrepresentations will be cleared up, and then everybody will worship Him acceptably, gladly, reverently and gratefully. This will be when Satan is bound, and when Christ’s kingdom is established in the earth, and when the dead have been raised to life again. At this time, and under the light of an accurate knowledge of God, which will be the portion of all, those who wilfully and re-belliously continue to resist the spirit of grace will be cut off from all life in everlasting death, second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such will be unworthy of life, and their punishment will be a wise and merciful act on God’s part, and will guarantee that the time will come when there shall be no more sin and no more sinners. The majority of people believe that sin and sinners will always exist, exactly as they do now. If this were true, then God would not be using His wisdom and power in wise and loving ways, and would not be worthy of our reverence and worship. If He purposed to keep the sinner alive and torment him forever, God would be hated throughout all eternity; His creatures would despise Him because lie had used His power so wickedly and unlovingly. They could not worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us for a moment look at the loving purposes of Jehovah God. First, He created the earth, purposing it to be man’s everlasting home. That is still His purpose, and that is exactly what the kingdom of Christ is to do, namely, resurrect all the dead, bind the Devil so that he will deceive the nations no more, and then bring everybody to an accurate knowledge of His loving purposes and laws, and thus enable them to choose life or death, intelligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely this reveals the fact that God is good, that He is love, and makes Him worthy of worship and praise. God’s law is that anyone who would not appreciate life and its blessings enough to keep from sinning, would not be worthy to live and should be punished with everlasting destruction. This complete destruction is pictured in the symbolic language of Revelation as a ‘lake of fire and brimstone’, which is explained in Revelation 21:8 as meaning the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most surely no one can find fault with such a penalty. It is reasonable, just and loving. After Adam had sinned and brought condemnation upon himself and his posterity God began to exercise mercy toward the race. He purposed to prove that He is justly entitled to be called a God of love, and so it is written that “in his love and in his pity he redeemed them”. (Isa. 63:9) He purposed to deliver the entire race, from that condemnation, and the execution of that purpose cost Him the dearest treasure of His heart, His own Son, and so it is written that “God so </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">loved</span><span class="font6"> the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” - John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a priceless gift that was! What an evidence of love! and what a demonstration that God is love, and worthy of the worship and praise of all His creatures! Surely He is the only wise and loving God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not at all strange that God should reward His Son for His faithfulness and obedience under suffering, and for the unselfish sacrifice of His human life, by resurrecting Him from the dead on the third day, and giving Him a name that is above every name, both in heaven and in earth; above the angels, principalities and powers, and set Him at His own right hand, where He is clothed with all power in heaven and in earth. It is written of Jesus that “He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of all these wonderful manifestations of wisdom, justice, love and power, it is no wonder that the Prophet Micah (chapter 7, verse 18) says: 'Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time is soon to come when every other conception of God will be destroyed, and every one will know the true God. Even those in the graves will come forth to enjoy the same privilege. When the wilful ones are destroyed in the second death, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">then,</span><span class="font6"> it is written, “Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.” (Ps. 150: 6) They will be rendering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font6"> worship to Jehovah God. It will be the spontaneous outpouring of loving, appreciative and happy hearts. Then men will be ashamed of the reflections and reproaches which they, in their ignorance and stupidity, have cast upon the name of Jehovah God. Every honest heart will make quick acknowledgment and amends for all past wrongdoings, return to God’s favor and love again, and enjoy eternally the blessings which God has prepared for those that love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even the destruction of the wilful and stubborn ones in the second death will be the last act of love and mercy that God can perform for them. Then will follow a clean universe, and all the intelligent creatures in heaven and in earth will be worshiping the only true God, the great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Instruction of the Young </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Sam J. Logan {Wyoming)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">1</span><span class="font6">WISH to congratulate you for the article in the November 25 (1931) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> on “Misinstruction of School Children”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In our distress many children are not in school, for want of the necessities of life. I am privately instructing my children, and we are very well pleased with the results. We use Judge Rutherford’s books for reading, instead of the so-called “classics” of the Devil’s organization; instead of, “To die, to sleep, perchance to dream; ay, there’s the rub,” etc. (Shakespeare’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet)</span><span class="font6">; or, “‘Dust thou art, to dust returnest’, was not spoken of the soul”' (Longfellow, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Psalm of Life)</span><span class="font6">; or, “Our country, may she always be right; but our country, right or wrong” (Stephen Decatur); instead of the arithmetic interest system, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Book,</span><span class="font6"> by Coin Harvey, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the colleges and higher schools are “hatcheries of infidelity”, what are these schools to which these educated return to instruct others? The Reverend Gordon is at present teaching here. He said, “I burn Judge Rutherford’s books, advise the people to do so, and will do the same to you if we [the clergy] ever get a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whole system is filled with mockery of Jehovah God and His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The county superintendent was here this morning. He said the school where the children are supposed to go was the most ill-mannered school he ever saw in his experience. Does he think ours should go to learn ill manners?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Its “Bureau of [Mis]Information”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS a bad business that can be built up and kept up only by a deep-laid system of falsehoods. Sooner or later the truth comes to the light and then the business comes in for the contempt which it rightly deserves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of public record that within the past year a man named Achille Hatti, alias “The Supreme Pontiff’’, the pope of Home, in dispatches sent by him by personal messenger for publication at Paris, disclosed to the whole world that subjects of himself and his priests may make promises with mental reservations; in other words, they may follow the age-long custom and practice of the priests and officials of the Roman Catholic church of lying, which custom is approved in the church literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lying has the approval of the Roman Catholic theologians and saints Alphonso Maria de Liguori, Antonio Escobar of Mendoza, Pope Gregory VII, Pope Innocent XI, and other church authorities, and is evidently part of the established policy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font6"> published at Huntington, Indiana, in the interests of the worst, most unprincipled, business on the entire earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of November 1, 1931, in its “Bureau of Information”, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font6"> publishes the following, and we publish beneath it the facts, which ought to convince any honest person that nothing it may say on any subject is worthy of belief:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1Wit&gt; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is Judge Rutherford? I have several friends who have been disgusted by some of his sermons, and they have asked me about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford is a man who has been delivering sermons against organized religion for about sixteen years. He preaches that there is no hell, and because of this doctrine has won the favor of many persons who, perhaps because of the life they lead, prefer to do away with the belief in eternal punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The so-called “International Bible Students’ Association”, otherwise known as “Russellites”, are making the claim in this locality that they recently converted a whole community of Catholic sisters to their “faith”. One of my neighbors, icho is intimately acquainted with the “Mother Superior” of this former community of Catholic nuns, is quite disturbed over this alleged happening. “Daughters of St. Rita” teas the name of the community; Mother Raphael, superior; and the address of the community in 1921 was 9 Grove Street, Yonkers, New York. These people are exhibiting, to impress Catholics, a photograph of the alleged “Mother Raphael” in nun’s garb. Her habit, crucifix and “beads” do make her look rather prepossessing. Is the claim false or true?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was not, either in the year 1921 or any year before that time, a community of Sisters recognized by the Church under the name, “Daughters of St. Rita,” at 9 Grove St., Yonkers, N. Y. In all these years the names and addresses of each religious community in the arch-diocese of New York, where Yonkers is located, were given in the “Official Catholic Directory”. There were two communities in the city of Yonkers in the years 1920 and 1921; one more was added to the list in the year 1922. But the “Daughters of St. Rita” were not among them. No matter how many photographs “Mother Raphael” may have taken of herself, she will go down in Catholic history as an impostor and it will also be recorded that the “Russellites” have added one more to their already large list of impostures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It w<sup>r</sup>as no doubt out of a full heart that William Hogan, a prominent southern lawyer, and formerly a priest, tvrote, on page 172 of his book on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Popcry,</span><span class="font6"> that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> pronounce all Roman Catholic priests, bishops, popes, monks, friars and nuns to be the most deliberate and wilful set of liars that ever infested this or any other country, or disgraced the name of religion”, but whether he wrote by inspiration or not we present now the evidence that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">has lied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First, we offer free to any subscriber for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The. Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> a copy of Judge Rutherford’s book on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell,</span><span class="font6"> What Is it? Who Are There? Can They Get Out? When you have read that book, with all the evidence it gives that the Bible hell is as different from the theological hell as day is different from night, you will understand just why </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font6"> wishes to convey the false impression that “he preaches that there is no hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Secondly, we have pleasure in publishing herewith a copy of affidavit of Maria Neuffer, formerly “Mother Raphael”, covering the lies in the second set of questions. It speaks for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">State of New York I &gt;&nbsp;County of Westchester )</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maria Neuffer, 9 Borcher Avenue, Yonkers, New York, being duly sworn, upon her oath states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Because the Catholic newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font4"> published at Huntington, Indiana, on November 1st, 1931, published false statements concerning myself and others, I voluntarily make the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I was born in Germany in the year 1868, and became a member of the Lutheran church as a child. I always had a great desire to serve Jehovah God, and to do so accepted the Catholic faith while in the city of Milan, Italy, and later entered a novitiate at Codogno, Italy, and became a sister known as Sister Raphael, in the regular way at the hands of a bishop. I served as a sister for years in communities at Codogno, Milan, and Rome, Italy, also at Madrid and Bilbao in Spain, and at London, England, where I served as Mother Superior of a convent for four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“During the many years that I was a Sister and Mother Superior the scheming for advancement by other members of the order, along with the sale of bones from the tombs in Rome as relics of the Saints, the payment of large sums of money for a cardinal protector, and for the securing of positions such as bishop and cardinal, made my heart sick, and caused me much sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the year 1905 the Mother Director sent me to America, and I came to New York in that year. I found conditions in the church in this country were just as bad as in Europe. There was the same jealousy, scheming, lying and evil speaking, instead of brotherly love and a desire to honor the name of the Lord. Refusing to submit to their evil ways although a member of the church, I earned my own way by nursing, and later founded an orphans’ home in New York City with about 30 children. Until 1920 I had difficulty with the Catholic authorities, and then I removed to my present address in Yonkers, New York, where I continued to send the children from the home to mass and permitted them to attend the various Catholic functions, and still considered myself a Catholic and a Sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In 1930, for the first time, I learned of the truth concerning Jehovah God and His Word when I heard Judge Rutherford speak over the radio, and I at once recognized it to be the truth that he spoke, and I then took my stand on the side of Jehovah God and withdrew entirely from the Catholic system and discarded the sister’s habit I had been wearing. When I saw that the Catholic church was teaching error and misrepresenting God, and that the truth is taught in God’s Word and is promulgated particularly by The Watchtower and its publications, I associated myself with such work in order to be one of Jehova h s witnesses; and I rejoice not only in the knowledge of the fact that Jehovah is God, and that the kingdom will bring blessings to me, but that all the people of the earth will have the opportunity for the blessings of life and happiness. I am more than pleased to tell those with whom I was formerly associated, and other good Catholics, that purgatory is not taught in the Bible but that it is entirely a myth arranged by men for the benefit of the few; that the doctrine of eternal torture is not true, and is not taught in the Bible; that saying prayers for the dead is wholly wrong and unscriptural, and that many other practices, such as the mass in the church of the Catholics, are entirely unscriptural and wrong. I advise all good, honest Catholics to provide themselves with the books published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and to take their own Bible and prove to themselves these things that are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The statement in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font4"> regarding my picture is entirely false, for I recall having only one picture taken years ago with the children of the home, and which picture I sent back to my people in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The facts stated above clearly prove that I am not an impostor as claimed by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Hillsville, Pa. “I certainly have enjoyed these programs. They have helped me out with my Bible lessons and filled my mouth with singing. My desire is to be present with you; I am with you in heart and mind. You have certainly opened the eyes of my understanding.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SECOND EDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">OF THE I.B.S.A. YEAR BOOK!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PUBLIC DEMAND has made a second edition of the I.B.S.A. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Year Boole</span><span class="font6"> necessary. For several years past the International Bible Students Association and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society have been publishing a Year Book, which has proved to be of vital interest to those identified with its work. The I.B.S.A. and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society are instruments used by “Jehovah’s witnesses” to carry on the wide public proclamation of the truth concerning God’s kingdom and its establishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until now one edition of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Year Boole</span><span class="font6"> has been sufficient, but this year brings an unusual demand for it by people everywhere. Many have obtained it who have not heretofore manifested such interest. It is evident that these desire to acquaint themselves with the extensive activities of the I.B.S.A. Many have written for a second and even a third copy, with the intention of giving it to their friends so that they too might know more about this organization which is really interested in the welfare of the people and is trying to inform them regarding the purposes of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is only one hope for the world, and this hope has been made known to millions of people through the publications of the I.B.S.A. and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Up to the present more than 110,000,000 copies of Judge Rutherford’s books have been distributed among the people, in more than fifty languages and dialects. If you have not read the I.B.S.A. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font6"> and you are interested in knowing more about the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, you will find this a most welcome book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first half of the book contains a report issued by Judge Rutherford as president of the association, setting forth the work accomplished during the past year in the distribution of the Kingdom message. In addition, this remarkable report is a proof of the world’s need of the Kingdom. The book also contains a text, with short comments, for each day of the year. These texts and comments have been a real help to students of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second edition of the I.B.S.A. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font6"> is now off the press, ready for mailing. It is obtainable at 50c a copy, postpaid, anywhere. Address THE WATCHTOWER, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>

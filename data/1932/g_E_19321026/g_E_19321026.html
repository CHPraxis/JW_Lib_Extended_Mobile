<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Poisons Formed by Aluminum Cooking Utensils</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By H. J. Force, Ph.G. (Pennsylvania)<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark25">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font3">ANY papers have been published showing that aluminum cooking utensils have formed poisonous products under certain conditions. Papers have also been published trying to show that aluminum is a safe material for general household use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the schools of pharmacy and medicine there are standard works on medicine and chemistry, as various </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medicas,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">United States Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> etc. These books give the physiological action of most drugs and chemical compounds. Let us turn to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">United States Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> 19th Edition, published in 1907, and based on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">United States Pharmacopoeia.</span><span class="font3"> The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">United States Dispensatory</span><span class="font3"> will be found in all drug stores, hospitals, physicians’ offices, etc., and is recognized in the courts as an authority on the use and doses of medical substances. Its recommendations have never been questioned. We are going to let the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory </span><span class="font3">speak for itself on Aluminum, page 112:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Uses. Alum is a powerful astringent, with very decided irritant qualities, owing to which, when taken internally in sufficient quantity, it is emetic and purgative, and may even cause fatal gastro-intestinal inflammation. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alum is sometimes used to adulterate bread, with the view to increase its whiteness and to conceal the defects of the flour. If the quantity used be sufficient, the alum acts as an irritant to the gastro-intestinal tract, and according to the results of experiments made by Bigelow and Hamilton, it actively checks peptic digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under Aluminum Sulphate, page 124 of the. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> we find:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Uses. The soluble simple salts of aluminum have the property of opposing animal putrefaction, but the sulphate is probably the most powerful and certainly is the most used. . . . Aluminum sulphate in saturated solution has been used for the preservation of dead bodies for dissection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We now turn to the 21st Edition of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">United States Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> published in 1928, which is the last edition, and shows a number of revisions and changes from the 20th edition. In this edition, we turn to Alum, on page 109, and under Uses, we find the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alum is a powerful astringent with very decided irritant qualities, and when taken internally in sufficient quantities is emetic and purgative, and may even cause gastro-intestinal inflammation. It is widely employed in various conditions in which an astringent or styptic is desired. . . . When small quantities of the soluble salts of aluminum are introduced into the circulation they produce a slow form of poisoning characterized by motor palsies and areas of local anesthesia with fatty degeneration in the kidney and liver. The nervous symptoms have been shown by Doellken to be due to anatomical changes in the nerve centers. There are also often symptoms of gastro-intestinal inflammation which is presumably the result of the effort of the glands of the intestinal tract to eliminate the poisoning. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under Aluminum Chloride, page 113 of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> we find:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Uses. Externally it is used as an astringent and antiseptic. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On page 1192 of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> under Aluminum Acetate, we find that aluminum acetate is used for water-proofing fabrics, and that it is also used as an embalming fluid. Also used in the manufacture of colors and in dyeing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(We think it would be very proper to state that aluminum acetate could be the cause of dying, especially if pickles were made in aluminum vessels. Vinegar contains acetic acid, and combines with aluminum to form aluminum acetate. Any preparation to be a satisfactory embalming fluid must be poisonous.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The combination of aluminum chloride with aluminum acetate would make an ideal disinfectant and embalming fluid. This combination could easily be brought about by adding salt to the pickles when they are preparedin aluminum. Aluminum chloride compounds will be formed when vegetables are cooked in aluminum to which a small quantity of salt (chemically called sodium chloride) has been added. Many natural waters contain quite a little salt. It is evident that when such waters are used when cooking in aluminum, aluminum chloride will be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been shown that aluminum compounds precipitate or destroy the pepsin, which is the principal ingredient in digestion. Alum is a compound of aluminum, potash, sulphur and oxygen, together with a small portion of water, and has the chemical formula Al K(S04) 2 + 12II2O. When vegetables are cooked in aluminum vessels, they often contain such compounds as sulphur, potash or soda, which could easily combine with the aluminum, forming small quantities of alum, also aluminum sulphate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many drinking waters through the United States are very hard, containing a large portion of sulphur compounds, also potash and soda. In fact, some waters which I have analyzed become alkaline on boiling. As potash and soda very readily dissolve aluminum, forming a compound similar to alum in its composition, it follows that this compound will be formed if aluminum utensils are used for any length of time to cook food products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sauerkraut when cooked in aluminum, will produce aluminum chloride, especially if allowed to stand for some tune. Many cases of poisoning have resulted from sauerkraut being cooked in aluminum, and some deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the preceding statements made in the. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory,</span><span class="font3"> it is evident that indigestion and constipation could he produced, and that the kidneys and liver could be affected with most serious results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The editors of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory</span><span class="font3"> are men of experience in medicine, chemistry and pharmacy, and they are considered authorities along these lines. They are as follows: II. C. Wood, M.D., LL.D., professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the University of Pennsylvania, president of the convention of 1900 for the Revision of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States; and Joseph P. Remington, Ph.M., F.C.S., professor of Theory and Practice of Pharmacy in the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, chairman of the Committee of Revision of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States of America; and Samuel P. Sadtler, Ph.D., LL.D., professor of Chemistry in the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, member of the Committee of Revision of the Pharmacopieia of the United States of America : and Albert B. Lyons, M.D., member of the Committee of Revision of the Pharmacopoeia; and II. C. Wood. Jr., M.D., demonstrator of the Pharmacodynamics in the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here we have the highest authority in the United States telling us of the poisonous effects of aluminum. Alum and the various compounds contain a large percent of aluminum, in most cases in soluble form which can readily be absorbed in the stomach or the intestines, and may seriously affect the kidneys and liver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Alum or any of its compounds should not be used in bread or general baking. As the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory</span><span class="font3"> points out, it may check the digestive process, due to its coagulating action on the pepsin compounds. Acute indigestion might follow, with the formation of gas which may press on the heart, producing death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When aluminum cooking utensils are used, there is always some aluminum dissolved. The amount will depend upon the kind of water used. At picnics, church suppers and other places where large numbers are served, the foods are often allowed to stand for some time in aluminum. As a result we often read in the newspapers of numbers of people being stricken ill very soon after eating, becoming poisoned from the aluminum compounds formed, and death often following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">People often say they like aluminum, as foods do not burn when cooked in such utensils. The reason is that some aluminum is always dissolving, forming hydrogen gas, and so pushing the foods away from the aluminum. The same thing applies to an aluminum griddle. Salt and soda are generally used in the batter, and these increase the solubility of the aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Large doses of aluminum compounds are often fatal. Small quantities may be taken daily with little or no effect. But sooner or later, indigestion, constipation, Bright’s disease, or diabetes may develop as a result of the continued use of aluminum ware, due to its solubility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some claims have been made that aluminum is not soluble when used for general cooking purposes. Statements of this kind are absolutely false, and show the gross ignorance of such writers. There is not a single laboratory in the United States that would think of using aluminum vessels for making chemical analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To show the solubility of aluminum, make the following simple test for yourself: Place in a well cleaned and scoured aluminum utensil one quart of water, a good pinch of salt and a pinch of baking soda, and let boil for one hour, adding water to make up the loss. Then remove from the fire and let stand for two or three hours, then pour into a glass jar and notice the milky condition caused by aluminum hydroxide. This will settle out in a day or so, but its presence is proof that aluminum is soluble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us see what textbooks, such as are used in our medical colleges, say about aluminum. Take the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Pharmacology,</span><span class="font3"> for example, by Alexander L. Blackwood, A.B., M.D., F.A.C.P., professor of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics in the Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago, published by Boericke &amp;&nbsp;Tafel, 1923, Philadelphia. On page 111 of this volume, we find under Alum the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Physiological Action. This agent is actively astringent, coagulating the albumen of the tissues and of the blood, and produces a local constriction of the capillaries. It is mildly escharotic and produces a hardening of the skin and tissues in general. It excites and later diminishes the salivary secretions as well as those of the mucous surfaces; it diminishes the gastric fluid and precipitates pepsin. As a result of its action on the intestinal sections, constipation is produced. Through its irritating properties which may be in excess of its astringent properties gastroenteritis may result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On page 112 in the same book, under Aluminum Hydroxide, the following statement is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Physiological Action. This agent produces profound prostration, with irritation of the mucous membranes, with diminished secretions, and as a result there is constipation and inactivity of the bowels. The nervous system is affected as is indicated by the extreme prostration with numbness of the parts and paralysis of the involuntary muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To make the above clearer, w<sup>T</sup>e give the definitions of a few of the words mentioned:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Astringent.</span><span class="font3"> A medicine which causes contraction of the tissues and arrests the flow of secretions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coagulation.</span><span class="font3"> Changing to a curd-like mass; becoming clotted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escharotic.</span><span class="font3"> A substance which burns and destroys the life of the parts to which it is applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You had better read the above over again. Your life may depend on the statements made by Dr. Blackwood, for according to the doctor, you will sooner or later hang out the crape, and have the undertaker back up in front of your house; that is, if you continue to use aluminum ware for cooking purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The coagulating of the albumen of the tissues and the blood is characteristic of most poisons, and would result in death. Such a condition could cause paralysis, insanity, cancer, rheumatism, neuritis, indigestion, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, some forms of skin diseases, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In God’s Holy Word, the Bible, it states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deuteronomy 12: 23: “Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Leviticus 17:14: “ . . . for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If your blood is being poisoned, which is your life, this condition is easily accounted for. The Bible is our only authority, and can be depended upon to state the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dispensatory</span><span class="font3"> and various </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medicas,</span><span class="font3"> it is apparent that the nation is being poisoned. There never was so much sickness and complaining, never so much stomach disorder, etc. Cancer has jumped from the tenth place to the second place as the cause of deaths in the last ten years. Yet at the same time we have more knowledge, more doctors, hospitals, radio lectures on health, and newspaper articles on how to keep well, etc., and sickness is still on the increase. There must he a reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Aluminum will affect the teeth, as this chemical has an affinity for calcium, and is so stated by dentists who have investigated the action of aluminum on the teeth. It is also possible for the aluminum to affect the calcium in the bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Try this test: Put one-half of a can of tomatoes in an aluminum vessel, and the other half in an agate-w’are vessel. Add the same amount of salt and baking soda to each. Cook, and then let stand for 24 hours, then reheat, and note the difference in taste. We would not advise you to eat the tomatoes cooked in the aluminum. Those cooked in the agate will still be good eating</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If tomatoes are cooked in a dull-appearing aluminum utensil, the acid in the tomatoes will act upon the aluminum, give the aluminum a very clean appearance. The amount of aluminum removed is of course dissolved into the tomatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To prove to your friends that aluminum ware is poisonous, give them the following dinner: Sauerkraut cooked in aluminum; beef and potatoes seasoned, cooked in aluminum; tomatoes with salt and baking soda, cooked in aluminum; bread baked with alum baking powder; custard pie baked in an aluminum pan; and coffee made in an aluminum percolator. Let all stand 24 hours, and then reheat and serve, but tell your friends what they are eating, and let them read this first. This should prove to anyone who is honest about aluminum that it is poisonous. If people will not believe the best authorities, then they must take the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">People often ask why the doctors do not tell us about aluminum poisoning. Many of them do, and recommend that aluminum ware be not used. Many physicians have paid little or no attention to this, question, and that is just why we are writing this, so as to tell them where to find the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have letters from the following physicians and surgeons, condemning the use of aluminum ware:</span></p>

We are in no way interested in any kind of cooking utensils, as to their manufacture or sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the facts set forth, especially in our standard works on medicine, we should call on our senators and congressmen to eliminate the use of all aluminum cooking utensils from the army and navy, from all hospitals and public institutions, from hotels, restaurants and all public places. People should not buy foods prepared in aluminum. Manufacturers of food products should stamp all canned goods ‘‘Not prepared in aluminum’’ when such is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We know you will enjoy better health, have fewer colds and better digestion if you eliminate the use of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Most vegetables contain a very small amount of aluminum, about one part in a million, but in an entirely different form from that which is dissolved when cooking foods in aluminum. The white powder often seen when cooking potatoes in aluminum is aluminum hydroxide, which is described in the Materia Medica in this paper.</span></p>

Maybe you never heard how judges cause deficiencies and double their salaries by sitting in other jurisdictions than their own.

The thing is so manifestly untrue and unfair that it is tiresome. The press associations are not trying to tell the truth; they are trying desperately to poison the minds of the public against those who have the misfortune to be unemployed and hungry. They even did that against the war veterans. The reason for their flood of propaganda against the hungry is so that when the time comes to use poison gas and machine guns the common, ordinary, every-day, average American bone-head will think that it was quite the right thing to do.

<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font3">RITING to Edwood K. Bean, burgess of Lansdale, Pa., who refused to permit the Hosiery Workers’ Union to meet in that borough, Governor Pinchot told him a few things that one would think would percolate through any bean, no matter how obtuse:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“If the Constitution of the State and the Nation mean what they say, then free speech is a fundamental right of every American citizen, and the denial of free speech is unlawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘ ‘ Both you and I arc sworn to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States and this Commonwealth. I call your attention pointedly to this fact, and to the very fact that obedience to the Constitution is the duty of every American citizen, including yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Entirely apart from the constitutional right of free speech, it has been demonstrated times beyond number that the policy of denying this right is dangerous and ineffective and has the direct result of advancing instead of repressing the cause against which the denial is made. The surest way to spread any doctrine or to disseminate any set of opinions is to forbid people to mention them in public. Even savages who perpetuate the names of their dead chiefs by forbidding the speaking of their names, have learned this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“To prevent meetings held in support of the right of labor to organize is to deny a right which the Constitution, the laws and the judicial decisions of Pennsylvania specifically recognize. ’ ’</span></p>

The April production was to have been 1,075 cars, but as only one or two rear axles were produced and an auto without a rear axle leaves something to be desired, the month’s output was not a shining success. However, that will be rectified. There have been railroad accidents. In one case, where several were injured, they were thoughtlessly laid on the other track of a double-track railway and a freight train came along and killed fifty of them. A dispatch from Rumania says that persons on that side of the river witnessed the shooting down by Soviet troops on the Russian side of the river of 100 persons who were participating in nothing worse than some kind of Easter celebration. It is claimed that recently in Moscow 1,500,000 soldiers inarched, as a notice to the world that Soviet Russia will fight to keep every inch of her soil her own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Can These Things Be?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font3">F YOU doubt the Scripture statement, “The whole world lieth in the wicked one,'’ you should read the illuminative and instructive book bearing<sup>-</sup> the above title by George Seldes, published by Brewer, Warren &amp;&nbsp;Putnam, 6 E. 53d St., New York City. There is probably not a man alive who knows more about the terrors of Fascism than George Seldes, veteran European correspondent of the Chicago </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune. </span><span class="font3">Certainly no observer of the system ever analyzed this hideous substitute for a government better than Mr. Seldes has done in his book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Imagine a country in which the school children are encouraged to come to school decked out in their fathers’ daggers and guns and to become braggarts and bullies, “a black terror edition of the League of Communist Youth.” The heads of the universities, the professors, and the teachers in the grade schools must all be members of the Fascist party. An official boycott is placed on all men of learning who are not active in Fascist polities. In Italy there is not a single nonFascist newspaper allowed, and therefore there can be no propaganda for liberty, democracy or freedom; yet at the same time Fascism has a fund of 5,000,000 lire to use for buying up newspaper space in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Americans generally do not know that in Europe it is a common practice for dictators to purchase newspaper space and editorial opinion for propaganda purposes in the principal cities of the continent, indeed, the practice is so general that even the European editions of American newspapers participate. On this point Mr. Seldes says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fascist Italy today is doing exactly what the Czar did from 1905 to 1917. The methods are not so crude, perhaps, but some day the Roman archives may show exactly what European and American newspapers have had subsidies of money, who has received decorations and honors, which newspapers and agencies have accepted the bribery of free cable and radio wordage, and just how and where the Fascist money was placed in advertising to buy up newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The incredible depths of meanness to which Fascism can go and has gone in its persecution of editors is illustrated in Albert Gianninni of the Becco Giallo. He published two photographs, one of an English bulldog and the other of Mussolini. They looked so much alike that a laugh went around the world — and Gianninni had to flee the country. His house was twice entered </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font3">Fascists; his entire life’s savings were stolen ; his wife fell ill, and during the long months of her illness two Fascist agents stood by her bedside until she died. Even the smallest of his children are under constant surveillance. They cannot go to lunch or play with other children or even go for a walk without the eyes of these agents of tyranny constantly upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not a foreign correspondent in Italy can send a dispatch which does not go to the Foreign Office to be copied. If anything displeasing is found the dispatch is delayed and sometimes it is garbled so that when it arrives at its destination it is unintelligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Travelers returning from Italy frequently report that the trains run on time, but Mr. Seldes gives a long list of other things which Mussolini has done to make Italy what it is today:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ACHIEVEMENTS OF FASCIST “GOVERNMENT”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of parliament;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of the constitutional power of the king;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of all the non-Fascist press;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of the right of public association, freemasonry, etc.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of free suffrage;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of freedom of the magistrates;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of free speech;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Law courts placed under Fascist militia;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of the inviolability of private homes;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of the right to choose and exercise a business or a profession;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Abolition of the right of free movement (emigration, or peasants’ going from one part of the country to another) ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Curtailment of the liberty of conscience and religion ; Abolition of the right to choose nationality;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Annulment of Article 30 of the Statutes guaranteeing no unjust taxation ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Suppression of all municipal liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And May 26, 1926, Mussolini said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'It is I who have dictated these measures: recall of all passports; order to shoot without warning anyone trying to cross the frontier secretly; suppression of all anti-Fascist publications; dissolution of all groups, associations suspected of anti-Fascism; creating of a special police in all parts of the country; creation of secret investigation bureaus and special tribunals.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the other hand, says Mr. Seldes, there are numerous accidents, but, as under Fascism it is forbidden to report train wrecks or other railroad trouble, the knowledge of these things never gets out of the country or, for that matter, very far away from the locality where the accident happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About a thousand banks and credit organizations have gone bankrupt under the dictatorship and in most cases the creditors got only ten to twenty percent. When the stock crash came in 1929 the banks and great industries were required to distribute the same dividends as in the previous year, with the result that in many instances the dividends were paid entirely out of reserves and frequently out of capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of the more, respectable acts of Mr. Mussolini’s “government” there can be set down his annual expenditure of 2,000,000,000 lire for police, gendarmes, city espionage and the six Fascist militias. There can be set down Mussolini’s demand that the families be increased as rapidly as possible so that a huge army can be produced for use in the promised day when Italy is to make the skies of Europe black with planes. As Italo Balbo, Fascist air minister, put the matter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘‘A modest aerial army of 300 planes carrying two tons of toxic bombs each, in a single flight can kill 50,000 inhabitants in ten different villages; that means in eight days they could put </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hors de jeii</span><span class="font2"> four million persons in eight places. Imagine the public services disorganized, the terrible anxiety to find out what gas the enemy is using, the anguish of violent lung troubles, and the panic! No anti-aircraft defense can prevent such an invasion. . . . We must give the enemy the precise sensation of our mastery of the air and the possibility of our aviation striking, without pity, the population of the country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another achievement of what might be called the &quot;regular and more legitimate aspects’ of Mr. Mussolini's government is that the maffia of Sicily and Calabria was broken up. Do you know how it was broken up? The larger branch of it was taken over bodily into Fascism. Stated otherwise, the little maffias have ceased to exist. A huge maffia covering the entire country has taken their place.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Treatment of Prisoners</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is in its treatment of prisoners that a government shows its true character. Concerning these Mr. Seldes says in the most matter-of-fact manner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tortures are used on political prisoners according to a method prepared in advance and identical in all Italian prisons. Besides the stabbing with sticks filled at the points with powdered lead, besides the fist blows with iron gloves, which are used in all police stations, we have information that the following methods are used upon political prisoners, ‘to make them talk.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Blows drawing blood. (Cases of Triests and Mon-facone already denounced in the press)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. The use of boiling water in which the prisoners’ hands are held to extort confessions through physical pain. (Cases of Milan and Brescia)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. Starvation, total darkness and blows used alternately. (This system was first used in Brescia and later was adopted in all Fascist prisons.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Injections of chemical substances in order to create a state of madness and obtain “information” from the prisoner during his delirium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. Pricking the testicles with pins until serious inflammation has begun. (Brescia and Genoa)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">6. In some instances tying the testicles with chains or ropes, regulating the pain by steadily increasing pressure. (Rome, Naples and Genoa)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">7. Thrusting pins deep under the nails. (Turin, Genoa, Milan)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">8. Enemas of a solution of iodine, causing very painful blisters in the intestines. (Perugia)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">9. Cutting the tongue with knives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">10. Pulling out the hair of the pubes. (As in Monfalcone and in Milan with Signorina Lina Morandotti, sent to a clinic insane from the pain)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">11. Even making use of insects, as in Florence, where to secure “confessions” from political prisoners a black beetle under glass is kept on the victim three and four hours until he “talks”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">If you have read the foregoing a few times and pondered it, you will perhaps not want to know anything more of what is going on in Italy. Yet you must know that at Ustica, one of Mussolini’s penal islands, when a prisoner committed suicide by jumping into the water tank, the other prisoners were compelled to drink the water from the tank while the body was rotting in it. When a second one committed suicide by jumping into the same tank, a request of the prisoners that the tank should then he cleaned and covered was refused. You should also know that in Italy, “on information received,” it matters not how, a man may be seized without warning, taken away, cross-examined for long periods and handcuffed for from 50 to 150 hours, placed in a sealed car, horribly hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter, and taken away. The ablest men in Italy have been sentenced to a living death because of offenses, real or imaginary, against the dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You should know that on Lipari the prisoners are beaten, spat upon, and the militiamen make the rounds of the prisoners’ sleeping quarters five times in a night. When the women begged that the rooms where the children were sleeping be exempt the monsters made ten inspection rounds every night so that sleep and rest became impossible. These militiamen even said in the presence of the prisoners that the day is coming when there will be a general massacre of the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You should know that in Rome itself a young man named Milosh was “crucified<sup>-</sup>’, Mussolini’s militiamen undertaking to pull the arms out of the body, which resulted in the breaking of the aorta. Death relieved the poor man of his agony. You should also know that in Regio Emilia twenty-five anti-Fascist workingmen were massacred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to blows, clubbing, kicks, and spitting in the face, the Chekah and the regular blackshirt militiamen use sandbags, irons, and an instrument they jokingly call a “nut-craeker”. It is made of two wooden sticks, fastened at one end by a piece of leather. The pain of the men tortured in this ‘nut-cracker’ is beyond human imagination.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Other Interesting Chapters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While it is a survey of Italian Fascism that has particularly attracted our attention, yet there are many other interesting chapters in Mr. Seldes’ book. He thinks the militarization of youth as practiced in Italy and Russia is leading on to another world war in which it will be decided whether Russian or American culture shall prevail. Our subscribers know that we rejoice in the assurance that God has a better way, which He will put into operation by executing in a wholesale manner all young and old murderers of Russia and Italy, as well as of the nations to the west. A reading of Mr. Seldes’ book will convince any honest person that this so-called “civilization” of ours is so rotten that it is falling apart and is really demanding for itself the destruction to which it is entitled and which it will receive at the hands of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another item or two in passing. Stalin is building in the Urals an industrial center capable of supplying all of Russia with munitions of war, from raw ore to the finished guns and chemicals of the future conflict. Italian and Bulgarian money is spreading Fascism throughout Bulgaria. From the moment he enters the country every American reporter is shadowed, and should he once dare to speak to a politician of any of the five non-Fascist parties, he becomes an object of special suspicion. The police pay the porters at hotels and apartment houses to report on mail received and sent out by journalists, to whom sent, from whom received, the names of visitors, persons he dines with and the itineraries of his trips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Mr. Seldes’ book you will see Germany going Fascist as you have seen it of late in the daily press, and you will have it pointed out to you that modern warfare is the liberation of nitrogen from its compounds and that Germany has facilities for ‘fixing’ more than twenty times the amount of nitrogen that all the rest of the world combined can ‘fix’. One of the new German airplanes is described as capable of carrying four small cannon, as well as numerous machine guns. These planes can carry five tons of bombs, keep an altitude of about 20,000 feet, beyond the anti-aircraft range, and make the circuit Madrid, Rome, Paris, Brussels and back without a landing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One more item will be of considerable interest to many of our readers because sometime ago we had an article on psychoanalysis and more recently one on demonism. On page 418 of his interesting book Mr. Seldes tells what happened to a young married woman who went to one of these psychoanalysis “experts”. It is enough of itself to make us long for God’s kingdom, for which we pray, and it convinces us that there is no other cure for human woes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He made her take a pad and pencil to her bedside and lay guard on her dreams. In a week he had her dreaming herself into a fantastic repugnance at the very thought of returning to the man who was footing the bills. In another week he had her dreaming of himself as the substitute for the husband. The third week they went to Budapest together, and left the boy alone in a Vienna hotel. The woman was lost in an irresponsible trance of neurotic passion in which all the social and personal obligations that hitherto had governed her were less than shadows. She had developed such a fixation on the psychoanalyst that she speedily bored him, and without making the faintest attempt to transfer her fixation from himself to anyone else, or even back to the husband, he left her. A month later the husband found the shattered wreck of his wife in a sanitarium. She had a maniacal aversion to his mere presence in the same room, and the baffled and agonized man was compelled to leave her there and return to America with the boy, whom she could not bear near her either.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font3">HE first information we have of the making of paper on which records were kept is from the Egyptians in 4000 B.C. It was produced from the pith of the papyrus plant, a reed that grows wild today along the banks of the Nile. Paper was also produced from the leafy tuft that grew on the tip of the stem, which was about eight feet out of the mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the year 105 B.C. Tsai Lun, a Chinaman, prepared paper from the bark of trees, especially the mulberry; also from hemp, rags and fishnets. Archaeological discoveries relate how the inventor later committed suicide, due to court intrigue. The Chinese also originated the use of lichen and starch for sizing, and gypsum for improving the surface. The Arabians learned the art from Chinese prisoners in Samarkand in A.D. 751.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The writings of the Hebrews were performed by the scribes, who wrote with ink upon parchment rolls and scrolls. Such scrolls were made of smooth sheepskins and goatskins and rolled up from the ends, and were so large and bulky as to require a wheelbarrow to cart several of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the days of the apostles, stationery was considerably in use by those who were able to read and write. These papers were not as thin and smooth as we have today, nevertheless they were suitable for letters, books, official records and documents. In 2 John 12 the apostle states: “Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink/’ Paul mentions “the books” and “the parchments” in 2 Timothy 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although printing by movable type was not invented until 1450, by Gutenberg, paper was first made in Germany in Ravensburg, in 1290.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up to 1800 paper was made everywhere from cotton and linen rags. With the increase of knowledge and of demand for writing and printing facilities the dirth of paper-making fibres was overcome with the introduction of the wood fibre, of which there is a good supply in our forests. Paper-making fibres are also obtained from straw, hemp, jute, sisal, esparto, bamboo, cornstalks, bagasse or sugar cane. Esparto, which is also known as Spanish grass, grows in Spain and in northern Africa. It resembles a stout wire and yields a high-grade book or printing paper. It has found much favor in England and other European countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Uses of Wood and Cellulose</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The wood or cellulose fibre is not limited to the production of paper, but has widened into a diversity of uses and applications. Allied paper products are wall board, shipping containers, drums, waterproof boxes and cans, cups, towels, handkerchiefs, twine, meshed cord sacks, wicker supplies, floor mats, window shades, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paper when properly produced and treated is used in the electrical industry for cable insulation, condenser dielectric, panel board and fibre paper, board and tubing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Woods or specially treated wood pulp high in alpha content or pure cellulose is used in great quantities for the production of rayon or artificial silk or fibre for clothing purposes. Celluloid, a camphor cellulose derivative, is used in many commodities. Cellophane, an air- and moisture-proof paper, is finding many uses, due to its transparency and convenience in the handling and sale of packaged goods. We must not leave out the lacquers and enamels which are cellulose solutions of volatile solvents, together with gums for adhesive purposes, and pigments and dyes for enamel finishes and coloring. Duco auto body finish is such a cellulose product. All this indicates that man is dependent upon the tree for shelter, dress, convenience and usages, as well as the fruits thereof to sustain his being.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>Chemical Nature of Cellulose</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Although considerable information has been obtained of the nature and chemistry of wood, much is yet to be learned. In order that papermaking can be better understood it is necessary to examine the wood and the cellulose constituents of which it is made. Wood is made up of chemical compounds, which begins with the simplest forms, namely, carbon dioxide that is obtained from the atmosphere, and water that is absorbed from the earth, to form other compounds of increasing complexity of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen until it reaches the end product known as lignin, which is a stable additive form of cellulose. The transition from the lower to the higher compounds is gradual, so that their chemical natures and reactions which distinguish them differ only very slightly. However, microscopic views of wood sections reveal a cellular and fibrous structure, a segregation of component constituents which ultimately form the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the action of heat and the sun rays the water (II<sup>2</sup>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sup>2</sup>) are synthesized into acids, carbonic and formic (H<sup>2</sup>CO<sup>3 </sup>and ILCO<sup>2</sup>H), which further polymerize into simple sugars, or monosaccharoids and polysac-charoids (C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>1(</sup>’O<sup>5</sup> and C<sup>12</sup>H<sup>22</sup>O<sup>10</sup>). Starches are formed (C<sup>12</sup>H<sup>22</sup>O<sup>10</sup>)n also, hcmi-celluloscs, celluloses, and lastly ligno-celluloses. The structures of the latter compounds are complex, though many formulas have been suggested. The X-ray has been of assistance in understanding the structure of the cellulose fibre.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>The Nature of a Tree</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A chemical analysis of coniferous or pine wood will approximate 53% cellulose, 28% lignin, 13% hemi-cellulose, 5% resins and waxes, and 1% proteins, mineral matter and tannin. This does not include the baric, for these are much higher in tannins. Coniferous or evergreen trees contain resins, whereas the deciduous, or the broad-leaved trees, which grow in the summer seasons, are non-resinous. A cross section of a log reveals the bark and rings of spring and summer wood. If the weight of the dry cellulose constituents be doubled, due to approximately 50% moisture contained in green wood, and the volume increased to 15% air space, the tree is made up in bulk and is only slightly lighter than water, so that it may float. In fact, some of our ordinary woods, such as green red oak, black ash, or sugar maple, will not float with the bark removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although wood is made up of 50%-G0%&gt; cellulose, in cooking or releasing the cellulose fibres a yield of 40%-48% is obtained, and is known as wood pulp. Under a microscope a fibre appears like a fine hair, cellular in structure. A jack pine fibre is .025 mm (millimeter) in diameter and 4 mm long (.001 x.15 inch), or .150.200 inch greater in length than in width. The hard woods are short-fibred, being .003 mm in diameter and .03 mm long, or .0012 x .012 inch, which length is ten times the diameter. Closer examination of a fibre will reveal that it is made up of a jacket in which is encased spools of fibriles which play an important part in the process of making a sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the tree the fibres are placed longwise adjacent to one another and much like bricks are staggered. The cellular- jacket is ingrown with lignin and is encrusted with it, cementing it to the neighboring fibres. It is this encrustant matter, or lignin, that must be removed to free the individual fibres in the pulping or cooking process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wood which is to be converted into paper arrives at the paper mill in four-foot and eightfoot bolts. If they are not already stripped of their bark, this is done by a tumbling process, after which it is cut into chips about three-quarters inch thick and one to two inches rectangular, being sheared in such manner so as to open up the grain for ease of penetration of the cooking liquor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chemical processes for reducing wood chips to a pulp are the alkaline or the sulphate and the soda processes, the acid or the sulphite process, and the neutral or the Keebra process. There are certain modifications and adaptations of these methods caused by the percentage variations of the active chemicals. Certain advantageous things are obtained by each process, and the pulp produced goes to make up the different kinds of paper.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>The Sulphite Process</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The sulphite process was discovered by an American chemist, Tilghman, in 1SG6, and is essentially described in his English patent. The Swedish chemist Ekman, who started the first sulphite mill in Sweden, is credited with making the process a success. The pulp is obtained by subjecting wood chips to an acid treatment of sulphurous acid and calcium bisulphite solution. The cooking liquor is prepared in a tall tower packed with lump limestone that is subjected to a gravitational flow of sulphuric acid solution. The pulping process consists of the dissolution of the ligno-celluloses by hydrolysis. The fibre, which is washed and screened, must be subjected further to a hydration process before it passes over the paper machine or Fourdrinier to be formed into a sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sulphite digester is of riveted plate iron construction lined with acid-resistant brick, although bare chrome steels are reported to be very successful. The digesters are 25 to 75 feet in height and 10 to 17 feet in diameter, holding from five to forty cords of hardwood in the form of chips. The cooking cycle may be as high as twenty-four hours, the temperature being gradually raised to 300°F. The yield of pulp on the bone dry basis is from three to twelve tons per cook, or about 40% of the original green wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sulphite process produces more papei- by far than any of the others. This is because it produces a whiter sheet, which requires only a little bleaching to produce a full white sheet for use as book, stationery and good grades of paper. Sulphite stock is also incorporated with rag, cotton and linen to produce a heavier and stronger sheet for use for documents, bonds, and policies. The best grades of paper may contain very little or no sulphite, the principal ingredients being cotton or linen, or both, from which Bible paper is obtained, as well as chart, drawing, and blotting or absorbent paper. Good bond or stationery, however, may contain considerable amounts of bleached sulphite. Newsprint is made of one to three unbleached sulphite and ground wood. Very often soda pulp is also used with sulphite and ground wood, as in catalogs. Book papers may he of soda, bleached magazine stock with 5%-40% clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Soap wrappers and crepe are of unbleached sulphite stock. Manila paper contains 25%-65% ground wood. Paper which has an oily and parchmentined appearance, often referred to as glassine, is of bleached sulphite highly hydrated or gelatinized, which is characteristic of all. parchment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>The Sulphate Process</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The sulphate or kraft process is an alkaline cook. It was introduced in Danzig, in 1884, by C. F. Dahl, as a substitute for the more expensive soda process. A higher yield also is obtained. G. F. Enderlein put it on a successful operative basis. The first kraft mill on this continent was placed at East Angus, Quebec, in 1907; whereas one of the first kraft mills in this country was built at Mosinee, Wisconsin, about 1910. The process is well suited to coniferous woods high in resin content, due to the fact that the alkali saponifies or dissolves fatty acids and rosins, which is not possible in an acid or sulphite process. The wood chips are digested in a rotating digester of four to six cords capacity and subjected to a temperature of 330°F. for one to four hours. The caustic soda and sodium sulphide in the cooking liquor attacks and dissolves the lignin, releasing the cellulose fibre. The caustic is converted into alkali carbonates and alkali lignate, which can be recovered by evaporation and burning. The sulphide is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate (whence the name) in the recovery furnaces with the subsequent reduction to the alkali sulphide. The carbonate is changed to the hydrate by means of hydrated lime in the causticizing process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sulphate process yields a pulp that produces a sheet of unusual strength and is referred to as kraft and is generally used for wrapping, being easily distinguishable by its tan color. It is used for toweling (when unsized), filing forms, box liners, catalog covers, for bag paper, magazine wrap and fruit tissue when mixed with sulphite. Considerable kraft is used for business stationery, which is very often lightened somewhat by mild bleaching or dyed to give a golden brown. Kraft, when thoroughly bleached, produces an exceptionally strong and high-grade bond of firmness, durability and good rattle, though the production is curtailed because of the higher cost of bleaching.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Miscellaneous Processes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The soda cook is an alkaline process similar to the sulphate. The omission of sodium sulphate in the recovery process produces a pulping liquor containing only the active hydrate which is more drastic in action, yet it yields a lighter pulp of easy bleaching qualities even though its strength is somewhat impaired. The wood used is poplar, although other woods, such as yellow pine and spruce, are employed. The digesters may be stationary, of welded iron construction, employing a steam pressure of 60-90 pounds per square inch, the cooking time being from three to five hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ground wood or mechanical pulp is produced in large quantities by subjecting four-foot bolts placed in a magazine hopper to pressure sufficient to disintegrate them against a revolving sandstone five feet in diameter. This is a very efficient method of producing pulp, since the conversion is 88%, twice as much as that obtained by chemical processing. The fibres are not released as such, however, but consist of finely divided and shredded wood, which are removed in a water suspension which also serves to cool the grindstone. Ground wood is used in chip boards, card boards, box boards, as well as wall boards. Some papers have been made entirely of ground wood, however, by steaming the logs before grinding, to soften them. Wall boards are made up of laminations of ground wood which are sized with rosin and glued together by means of sodium silicate. Plaster board consists of a top and bottom liner of ground wood with lime plaster between. Cheap wrapping papers are produced by incorporating the finer ground wood particles with chemical fibres during the process of paper-making. Woods used for newsprint purposes are the firs. Spruce, hemlock, tamarack and pine are generally used, as well as poplar, birch and pine as fillers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ground wood can often be detected by examination of the sheet for woody shives. An alcoholic, solution of phloroglucinol will color ground wood red, due to the lignin reaction. Sulphite and kraft fibres must be distinguished under the microscope by dye absorption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The preparation of pulp is only the first step in the production of paper. The processing of the fibres by means of beaters and Jordans to hydrate or partially gelatinize them is another step. To the stock is also incorporated rosin size, and alum together with fillers and ingredients such as talc, clay, casein, starch, dyes, etc. The stock thus prepared is formed into a sheet by passing over the Fourdrinier wire, thence to the dryers, and finally through the calenders, the sheet being reeled as it emerges from the machine. Such Fourdriniers may be upward of 270 feet in length producing a sheet 150 inches in width traveling at a thousand feet a minute. The most recent book paper machine produces a sheet about 28 feet in width, producing an acre of paper in seventy seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Giving of Gifts (C'onG</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font3">OR every action there is a reaction. For everything given out there must be a corresponding action which satisfies the all-pervading law of .justice, the omnipresent law of recompense. God gave man his perfect home in Eden, and the corresponding price was to be perfect obedience to the will of God. Man failed, and loss of Eden followed as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the purpose of God it became necessary for a corresponding price to be paid to make up for man's failure: a perfect man must die to atone for Adam’s failure. It was the outworking of God’s purpose for the redemption of man, a purpose in which justice ruled. Justice is the great balance wheel that gives meaning and emphasis to love and power. Without justice God himself would be less than God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is no compliment to those who continually give gifts without thought as to whether they are deserved or not, nor to those who continually receive such undeserved gifts. They are not appreciated, and only make for growing selfishness and ingratitude. Rich and doting-parents who shower gifts upon their offspring without thought of common sense need not be surprised if their children grow up without perspective on life, having no idea of the “value of money’’, as they put it, if their children become domineering, selfish and snobbish, overbearing and always demanding the best of everything for the mere asking, and even being incensed when others do not anticipate their desires without their asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The infernal system of giving “tips’’ is also of devilish origin, and works for no end of injustice all around. Secretly, it is likely that no one receives a tip without loss of self-respect; for the godlike qualities are not quite dead in the human heart. No doubt Nietzsche had in mind something of the idea of the injustice of reckless giving of gifts when he said that 'we should hate our benefactors; for they have no right to place us under obligation by their charity.’ However, true charity is not mere almsgiving: it aims to help unfortunates to help themselves. It is true that gift-giving only encourages vagrancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christmas, with its crazy gift-giving, works for ill feeling among the gift-givers and for no end of injustice to the poor clerks in the stores at the Christmas season and for weeks before. By continually nullifying this great law of just recompense Satan has brought reproach upon God’s name in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Getting something for nothing is what motivates the holdup thug, the burglar and all thieves, not to mention those highly “respectable’’ thieves who turned traitor to their government and manipulated Teapot Dome to their own selfish interest. Getting something for nothing is like a canker that eats: eats at all selfrespect and destroys the best in the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, we see contemptible persons seeking to injure the reputation that someone has worked for and deserved. Too lazy to deserve anything themselves, they resort to the practice of trying to bring the deserving individual down to their own level through mud-slinging. These persons are not willing to see anyone profit through honest effort. Inspired by the Devil, they hate anyone who pays the price and receives a well-earned recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The giving of undeserved gifts plays the greatest role in those cases where lewd women live off the bounty of rich men. These creatures demand gifts in every form: fine homes, furs, fine clothes, limousines, servants, etc. There is no end to their selfish and degraded desires. All they give in return is “love” that is not love at all, but simply selfish gratification. This kind of “love” usually brings loathsome disease, suicide, murder, disgrace, and horrible friendless old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beware when you give a gift! It may seem like a good thing; but many things are not what they seem on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Someone will say that Christ did not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font3">money to give gifts when He was on earth, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font3">that He gave life where death had come, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">that He gave health where even leprosy reigned, and then ask if these were not free gifts. Yes, they were gifts; but He always asked if the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">af</span><span class="font3">flicted believed that He was able to do the thing asked. When answering in the affirmative the afflicted were acknowledging the power of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font3">for benefits received; and this was just what was required of Adam, but through the influence of Eve he was led to acknowledge Satan’s “wisdom”, which was only the beginning of the age-old misery of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Osteopathic Treatment of Insanity </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By Arthur D. Hildreth, D. 0. (Mo.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font3">ROM a booklet entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mental Patients in State Hospitals 1928,</span><span class="font3"> published in 1931 by the U. S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, we find, in Tables I and II, that this country’s public and private institutions for the. insane had 267,617 resident patients on January 1, 1923, and only 187,791 on January 1, 1910. Here was an increase of more than forty-two and one-half percent in thirteen years. The figures do not include the insane cared for at home, in alms houses, in prisons, etc. Of the 267,617 resident patients in 1923, 229,664(eighty-five and eight-tenths percent) were in public hospitals. On January 1, 1929, these public institutions had 272,527, a further increase of fourteen and a half percent in six years. In addition there were 31,127 listed patients temporarily absent or on parole, making a total of 303,654 Jisted in public hospitals alone. A prominent psychiatrist states that one out of every twenty-six babies born in the United States is destined to become incapacitated by abnormalities of the mind. Dr. Charles H. Mayo is quoted by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">How to Live</span><span class="font3"> as having said in a recent address, “Every other hospital bed in the United States is for the mentally afflicted, insane, idiotic, feeble-minded or senile persons.” All those facts show the desperate need of a remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Insanity! Think of it! In your state of New York there exists a condition of insanity and its control, or rather lack of control, that is paralleled in only one other state of the Union. I quote the report of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene when I tell you that in 1930 there were 56,496 patients in institutions for the insane in this state. Ten years earlier, in 1920, there were 40,780 such patients; an increase of almost 35 percent. Ten years ago in this state the insane patients were 390 in every 100,000 population. The present proportion is 445 to every 100,000 population. Moreover, in your state institutions the number of insane patients housed exceeded the capacity of those institutions by 35.4 percent. The most appalling condition of overcrowding was in Kings Park Asylum. The certified capacity of that institution is 3,742. In 1930 it housed 5,776, an excess of 2,034 unfortunates, which is 54.4 percent above capacity, these figures again being given by your State Department of Mental Hygiene. If this growth of insanity is to continue, you, as physicians, must shudder when you visualize the insane asylums of 1982.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The object of this article is to emphasize the fact that there is a cure for most types of insanity. The seventeen-year record of one of our osteopathic institutions for the treatment of mental disorders has shown that osteopathy, when given a fair trial, cures more than fifty percent of the insane. Since 1892, when the first school of osteopathy was established by Doctor Andrew Taylor Still, this system of therapy has had to fight against ignorance and prejudice for every inch of its progress. Against organized opposition it has won its way, and the position it occupies today is due to the fact that it has been able to demonstrate its worth in the cure of human disease, including many conditions pronounced incurable by other systems. So it is with insanity; the osteopathic records speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the past seventeen years more than two thousand insane people have come under osteopathic treatment and care. Of those remaining under treatment a. reasonable length of time recoveries were made by fifty-five percent : a record previously unheard of in the cure of the mentally sick. These cures were, due primarily to osteopathic treatment, which means the correction of all physical maladjustments, whether of bone, muscle or sinew, but especially of the spinal bones, in order to remove sources of nerve irritation and the resulting disturbances of function.

<p><span class="font1">(An appreciation of Judge Rutherford's book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life) </span><span class="font1">(From Norfolk </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ledger-Dispatch)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font3">u. Rutherford devotes an entire chapter to Job in his book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font3"> He covers the entire book of Job from the first chapter to the last and finally in a summary gives the lesson of the book. This lesson is that Jehovah is the only true God, that His power is supreme and that He is the source of all life. That Satan is the embodiment of evil, the enemy of man, and the adversary of God. That Satan has a powerful organization both visible and invisible to man; that on earth there is a class of men and women who have a desire for righteousness but who have been blinded by the efforts and misrepresentations of Satan and his agencies. That God also has an organization, part of which is invisible to human eyes; that shortly God will express His indignation against Satan and his agencies by a demonstration of His power in a time of trouble to be visited upon the world; that following the time of trouble peace will come to the peoples of the earth and all will be brought to a knowledge of the truth and that those who will know and obey God shall be restored to their homes, their friends, their property, and be given even much more than they ever before possessed, and, above all, the obedient will receive life everlasting and dwell together in peace upon earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This appears to be the doctrine proclaimed by Mr. Rutherford. And there is no great quarrel with it, on the whole. It is not altogether unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opening statement concerning Job by the author of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> however, rather stumped this reviewer for a while. It reads: “Jehovah is the greatest moving picture producer. He permits men to make some pictures and as a result of their efforts they think they are great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first thought was that Author Rutherford was referring to Hollywood, for there is no doubt that they think they are great in that neck of the woods. And it is also true that nature provides the greatest of all motion pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it seems that Mr. Rutherford also means that Jehovah illustrates His teachings through the life of men and that Job was one of His illustrations : a motion picture by which the triumph of good over evil, through the faith and abiding fortitude of a sturdy, true man, is shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And, of course, with that view none may quarrel, for it seems to be eminently right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font3">T IS commonly said that education is a great safeguard against quackery and faddery. I profoundly disbelieve it. So far as I can see, the higher one goes in the social scale the more does fashion in health matters prevail and the so-called intelligentsia are the most gullible of all, and it would almost seem, indeed, as if everyone has a certain stock of credulity and the more skeptical he is in everything else the more credulous is he in matters medical. It may be replied that this is the result of the wrong kind of education and that what is needed is more teaching of science. Again I disbelieve. If this were so the saying of Matthews Duncan would not be true (as I, for one, believe it to be) that “there are more quacks inside the profession than outside of it”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To the Milkman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You see, Sir, I have four children, And children must drink milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Last spring I got a report from the school nurse That Bob was anemic and Emily under-weight. “Give them milk three times daily,” read the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You see, Sir, it is important that I have good milk to feed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My husband will find work soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why, just this morning I read in the paper That the unemployed are to be cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But first they must be counted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four, five, six millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And it is only a few hours between</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Breakfast, dinner and supper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To the Landlord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No, Sir, my husband is not at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He is out looking for a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He spends every day looking for a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And some day soon I know he will find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My husband is a good mechanic, and good mechanics will be wanted soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But right now we have four children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a fine piece in the paper this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There will be nothing to fear this winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Load of Distress”, I think they called it, Will be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But before the. load is lifted it must be weighed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I wonder what sort of scales they use to weigh a “Load of Distress”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And how many pounds of distress</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Equal a ton of coal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please, Sir, be patient a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My four children cannot live in the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the Gas Company Collector:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">I promised you a week ago and I can't make good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not today, but one week from today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You know my husband is a mechanic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He used to w’ork for the gas company, and he had a fine record, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He must land a job soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perhaps the gas company will take him back.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">They’ll get around to us any day now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please, Sir, don’t turn off the gas, not yet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses in Burmah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By 8. B. Coote*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font3">E ARE a company of four way out in Bur-mah, residing in Pyuntaza, a railway center 87 miles up the line from Rangoon. We are small in number but ‘great is the company that publish’ Jehovah’s Word. We work through the Bombay office and I write this direct, as I know that the limited staff we have in our offices are also kept busy the whole day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gladly, boldly and hopefully we go about publishing Jchovaifs name, and it surely would interest you to know that, even out in this remote corner, the great God has His purposes. The following incidents are worthy of note and I detail them below by way of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Incident No. 1: Joining a ‘sharpshooter’ sister at Toungoo (another railroad center eighty miles farther north) we placed, a few weeks back, 32 booklets and 13 volumes. A good many of these fell into the hands of Roman Catholics. The parish priest heard of this and, a few days later, rushed around collecting the books we had placed. ‘Truthful’ as these Roman Catholics are to their “shepherd”, of the twenty or more books taken by them, only one </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet was given up; the other poor innocent truthful sheep had not even ‘heard’ of the books. One, who had taken a supply, answered, “Nothing doing, father’; I will never buy or read religious books outside the catholic church, and I will never change my catholic faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At church service the following Sunday announcement was made to the effect that all Roman Catholics found reading Judge Rutherford's books will be excommunicated; that Mrs. D'Souza (once a prisoner in the Roman Catholic church but now our resident sharpshooter) is responsible for the distribution of the books, and therefore she is soon to be excommunicated. That parson might have saved himself from making the latter part of this announcement, because Mrs. D’Souza had given heed to Jehovah’s warning “Come out of her my people” and, a good while before this, had just ‘jumped out of the mire’. Following this several other announcements were made by the priest, who even went around telling Mrs. D’Souza’s friends not</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">♦'(From a personal letter to Judge Rutlierfoid; a little too long for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> but just long enough for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden -Ige.</span><span class="font1"> Sometime when ears seem unduly deaf in the field where you strive to uphold the honor of Jehovah’s name, just give a thought to those that are far out on the skirmish lines, far out on the edge of the world, courageously carrying on the fight under conditions far more difficult than any we face at home.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.) </span><span class="font3">to visit her any more as she “will try to convert you to her new religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The writer of this article visited Toungoo some weeks later and a clash with the priest was the result. After a short argument the priest wound up with “That may be as you explain, but the pope is infallible, and if he interprets otherwise, we are bound to follow.” I may mention that that priest showed very little knowledge of the Bible. In course of our conversation he said to me, “Do not be annoyed if I pass my opinion on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet which I have read.” “Not that your opinions count,” I said, “but carry on.” “My opinion,” he said, “is that it was written by a mad man.” I smiled, I laughed, I jumped for joy, and then replied: “Good; you could not have given a more favorable opinion.” He looked surprised and told me that I ought to burn all the books I have, after having heard a remark of that nature. “Are you familiar with the name Paul?” I asked. “Why sure,” he replied, “did not Paul write a lot of our Bible ?” “Please turn to Acts 26: 24,” I suggested. We found the verse, and the priest read it. “Now tell me,” I said, “just how mad was Paul ?’’ That was too much for him, and he preferred to remain silent. “Thank you. Good night,” I said, and left him pondering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I left with him nine of your volumes. He is reading them and is also circulating them amongst the clergy there. I wonder if we have ‘insane asylums’ enough to accommodate a million or more of us. The clergy in Toungoo are now declaring that ‘you and all your followers are insane’. I quote from a letter received from this same priest some days later, and this will show just how much these people understand of what they read about. “You are simply favoring the propaganda of Judge Rutherford, a Jew, who hopes against hope to reestablish his nation. My friendly advice to you is to give up the propaganda in favor of a Jew and to resume the faith of your fathers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Incident No. 2: One of the clergy of Toungoo, taking a class in Bible study, read out to the children a passage from your book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lieconciliation </span><span class="font3">and wanted to know “with what authority does Judge Rutherford write the following [page 100, paragraph 2]: ‘The doctrine of the trinity was first introduced into the Christian church by a clergyman of Antioch named Theophilus.’ ” He further read: “If you ask a clergyman what is meant by the trinity he will say ‘it is a mys-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tery’.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Now I</span><span class="font3"> would like to ask the man who wrote this book,” he said, “how a tiny plant grows into a big tree, and I am sure he will say ‘it is a mystery’; so in the same way the trinity is a mystery.” Then he added: “A few of the millionaires of the U. S. A. invested their money in Palestine in order to rebuild it. Now to recover that money they have written these books and are selling them. They were written by some stupid person, and all those who agree with him are stupid.” Every ‘curse’ is a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Incident No. 3: This exposes these “bellygods”. The leading priest of Burmah, who has charge of the Roman Catholic cathedral in Rangoon, escorted six nuns of the order of The Poor Clairs, to Nyaunglebin, a station five miles north of Pyuntaza. This was for the purpose of visiting the shrine of ‘Our Lady of Lourdes’. The priest in charge of the Nyaunglebin church accompanied them on their return to Rangoon. When passing through Pyuntaza I noticed that two of the nuns were traveling in a first-class compartment with the two priests, while the other four nuns were in the second-class compartment. The ticket checker neglected the check of this compartment. I ordered it (I am the station master of Pyuntaza, by the way). The priests held first-class privilege passes; the nuns, only second-class tickets. The clergy around here are swell-headed enough to think nothing of breaching rules in this way and appropriating to themselves privileges which they are not entitled to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman Catholics and even other employees of the railway fear these clergy to the extent of overlooking such faults to the neglect of their duties. However, it was not one of their own Babylonian prisoners they had to contend with on this occasion, but one of the true witnesses of Jehovah. ‘’Levy excess fare, and if not willing to pay difference of fare for onward travel, ask the nuns to please move into the second-class,” were the orders I issued to the ticket checker. The orders were very reluctantly conveyed to the clergy. There was a great ado; the priest said it was all rubbish and nonsense: the station master was to be called at once. I walked up. “What is this man talking rubbish?” said the Rangoon priest to me, meaning the ticket examiner, “it is only ladies after all, and surely it can be overlooked.” “No rubbish at all,” I replied ; “rules are rules and must be abided by.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He never in the least expected such a rebut; it is most unusual for them to meet with such opposition out here, where they are treated like gods. Quite taken aback and annoyed, “It is nothing but a shame for you to behave like this,” he said. The nuns did not wait to be told a second time. They were up and getting out of the compartment. If looks could kill, this narrative could not have been related by me. I held my poise and was very courteous, performing my duties as I ought to. Again the priest cried shame on me. “Thank you,” I said; “this is the first tune I learn that it is a shame for one to be honest in one’s duties.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While my clerk was preparing the Excess Fare Receipt, several rude remarks were passed between the two priests, such as, “This station master is going to get a promotion because he is excessing priests,” etc., etc. I remained silent. When handing over the receipt, for the third time I was told that I ought to be ashamed of myself for the way in which I behaved. This was too much to bear and I could not help but reply, “You preach honesty but encourage dishonesty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I may mention that this piece of honest work on my part has brought me into the bad books of my superior, whose mind has been biased against me by the Nyaunglebin priest and other Roman Catholics who have laden him with false and exaggerated tales about our witness work out here. Imagine being told by a superior that I should restrict my actions towards the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Incident No. 4: The railway chaplain (Anglican church) used to hold monthly services at this station. The other three witnesses here, and I, were members. Owing to the poor outlook ahead, there was a proposal to dispense with the services of the chaplain. He spoke to me to try to keep up the collections he got from here, as he would not like to be sent away. We kept on for about two months. Jehovah through His servant. Judge Rutherford, did ‘lighten our darkness’. We did not any more feel like hearing about the “immortal soul” or like singing “God in three persons, blessed trinity”. The Bible held out to us a widely different story, and a far better one at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We stepped out of Babylon boldly, with the usual threats, of course, that we would not be buried by a priest, that our children would not be christened, etc., etc. Attendance at service usually amounted to about 12. That dwindled to a couple, and, finally, to the parson’s having to preach to himself. The folks around preferred an armchair in a snug corner of their homes with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> or other interesting books which they had taken from us, to the usual “gospel” meeting wherein they were, told more about collections for this and for that than about the Bible. The bomb did its work. In the chaplain’s tour program, Pyun-taza is now omitted. The same thing may happen at one or two more stations. The poor chaplain must be biting his nails. Will he have to sail soon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let me tell you that there is a stir in Burmah now about the truth as there never before was. The clergy are up in arms against us, urging the authorities to harm us, but the witness work is going boldly onward. The railway officials want to know why all this depression has come about and when it will end. When they are told to read all about it in your books and in the Bible they scoff at the idea. “The Bible has nothing at all to do with it,” they say; “religion is a lot of rubbish.” The clergy give the people hopes that “good times” are just around the corner. Lately some of us were threatened with arrest if w<sup>T</sup>e did not stop witnessing, but each one says, “That’s the ‘spur which pricks the sides of my intent’.” This is what a recent convert has to say: “There is no doubt that there is but one true God, Jehovah. It is only after reading some of the books and receiving explanations from Jehovah’s witnesses that I understand the Bible. All this while our priests have been teaching us a religion to suit their own pockets.” This is from the pen of a once very staunch Roman Catholic who, at the commencement, called us ‘antichrists’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We. have about twelve brethren in Rangoon; and three others, with their families, I am informed, joined our ranks a few days ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I sent a typewritten copy of your ‘Challenge’ to a Roman Catholic relative of mine in Maymyo, pointing out that if the Roman Catholics were anywhere near the truth they would accept it. He in turn sent it on to the Catholic Truth Society, India, asking them to accept it. “It is all rubbish. Pray to the Savior and our lady and you will be all right,” was the reply he got.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company at Pyuntaza is composed of Brother Dickens and myself, with our wives, making four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Toungoo is Sister D’Souza, and last week, Mr. D’Souza and Miss D’Souza were added. Mr. D’Souza, I may mention, is a Goan, and was a very staunch Roman Catholic. His example will bear weight. He was deeply impressed with the account of the Goans in East Africa, given in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Maymyo, a hill station at the other end of the line, is Sister Adjie, who has been a faithful witness for the past four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Tsatos, of Rangoon, lately introduced into the truth a young Burman graduate, who has turned out a keen witness. This happened just at the time when we were wanting the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet translated into Burmese, and our young Burmese friend has very kindly undertaken to do this for us. This proves how wonderfully Jehovah God accomplishes His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are several others who are deeply interested and who are considering active service. It appears to me that this is God's “due time” to stir Burmah, and that makes me realize the nearness of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And how strange! The revelation of Ezekiel’s prophecy concerning Gog and Magog comes to us at this particular time; a time when the physical facts fit in so minutely with the words of the prophecy. I quote from paragraph 18 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of June 15,1932. “The witness work of the people of God, taking on a wider scope, and being done with an ever increasing enthusiasm, comes to the attention even of Me-shech and Tubal, over which Gog is the prince or the immediate ruler.” This is what is happening in Burmah today. How good and gracious and accurate Jehovah is, that he should bring to us this message of hope at the right time, just when some feel the need of encouragement. How’ lovingly does our Lord now greet and cheer ps with the words of Isaiah 54:17: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord ; and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All warm Christian wishes go to you from us, and we unite in a prayer that the Almighty may strengthen you in your efforts to lead us on in this greatest of battles. All praise goes to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.”—Rev. 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font3">E FEEL, somehow, that if a person is valorous for the right, when he knows what is right, he is worthy of life, but if he is not valorous for the right, then it is at least open to argument as to whether he is worth the room he takes up. And that is about the view that the Scriptures present. Obedience to God, that is, obedience to what is right, is a requirement of all who will ever have eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conditions surrounding eternal life may be summarized as follows: One must give God the first place in his heart; obey God's commandments to the best of his ability; get a knowledge of Jesus Christ, God's Son; accept Jesus as the bread from heaven; hear and listen to His voice; become one of His sheep; do the work Jesus gives him to do; give earthly possessions a secondary place in his heart; and show love and mercy toward all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God can take a man that is an arrant coward in himself, and if he will be obedient He can make of him a mighty man, a man of valor. We have such a case in the career of Gideon, and it helps us to get a true perspective on this subject of courage. We are helped to see that when we get to the place where the doing of God's will is the most important thing in life we automatically arrive at true valor and true happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was not long after the death of Joshua before the people of Israel were in trouble. The trouble in every instance was due to the same cause: deflection from God, going away after other gods and being permitted to go the way of their choice until they got into difliculties from which the true God alone could extricate them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Midianites in Full Control</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One such instance we have brought to our attention in the sixth chapter of the book of Judges. The Midianites had come into the land, and Jehovah had permitted them to have an easy victory over His professed people. For seven long years they had been the absolute, uncontested rulers. They had even taken over the Jewish homes, so that multitudes of the Jews had been compelled to make their abode in dens and caves and strongholds in the mountains.— Judges G: 1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the Jews sowed their fields the Midianites and the Amalekites undertook to look after the reaping, and they did such a good job, or rather such a bad job, that from one end of the land to the other, from the extreme east to Gaza at the extreme southwest, they ‘‘destroyed the increase of the earth” “and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass”.—■ Judges G: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Apparently they were not content with merely taking what they wanted for their own comfort, but laid the entire land waste, devastated it. “For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.”—Judges G:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The natural result was that the Jews became greatly impoverished, and, finding that their new gods, the gods of the Amorites, afforded them no comfort or help, they cried to the God of their fathers, the true God, Jehovah, and He heard their cry and answered their prayer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Why Israel</span><span class="font3"> ff'as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in Trouble</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The first thing Jehovah God did for them was to tell them why they were in trouble. He sent them one of His prophets, reminding them that it was He who had brought Israel forth from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and who had driven out all their enemies from the land of Canaan and made them to possess it. The concluding words of the prophet were: “And I said unto you, I am Jehovah your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ve have not obeved mv voice.&quot;—Judges 6: 6-10.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whatever effect that sermon of the prophet may have had on others, it is certain that it awakened in the mind of one young man a desire to know and to do God’s will. Gideon is mentioned in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews as one of God's men of faith. Without a doubt he heard that sermon of the prophet and without a doubt he believed what he heard and wished that he had some way in which he could act upon his information. No other conclusion is possible in view of what immediately followed the prophet's message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The account goes on to say that an angel of Jehovah God came, manifestly in human form, and seated himself under an oak near where Gideon was threshing wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the oppressors, the Midianites. Very evidently the sitting posture was adopted so as to avoid startling Gideon ;the angel wanted to put him entirely at his ease.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>A Mighty (Timid) Man of Valor</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Looking ahead to the things that he knew Jehovah had provided for him to do, and ignoring entirely everything about Gideon except his desire to obey God, to do His will, the angel said to him, in the most matter-of-fact way, “Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.” (Verse 12) The context shows that the only reason he was a mighty man of valor was that he was obedient to the King of the universe, and could be used by Him to do His will. He needed to have his backbone stiffened over and over again before he could do anything, and the angel was there to do the stiffening work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gideon’s first response was an argument with the angel. The angel had said, “Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour,” and evidently intended the message to be taken by him personally, but Gideon, with becoming modesty, and in complete self-forgetfulness, thought only of Israel as a whole when he replied: “Oh my Lord, if Jehovah be with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us,</span><span class="font3"> why then is all this befallen </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us?</span><span class="font3"> and where be all his miracles which our fathers told </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font3"> of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font3"> up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath forsaken </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us,</span><span class="font3"> and delivered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font3"> into the hands of the Midianites.”—Verse 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can be pretty well assured that the angel of Jehovah suppressed a smile when he looked benevolently on him after that speech and kept right on with the stiffening process, saying, “Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?” (Verse 14) Gideon’s might was in the fact that Jehovah God had sent him to do something; it was certainly not in anything else, least of all in himself, and we must give him credit for recognizing that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Realizing at last that this spokesman for Jehovah was talking to him personally, and being deeply conscious of his own littleness and weakness, Gideon made reply: “Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”—Verse 15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Stiffening Gideon’s Backbone</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The angel went right on with the stiffening process, and, speaking for Jehovah, said, “Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.” (Judges 6:16) That was a large order, but Gideon believed, and to one who believes God all things are possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“And he said unto him [the angel], If now </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">have found grace in thy sight, then shew me </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">sign that thou talkest with me. Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he [the angel] said, I will tarry until thou come again.”—Judges 6:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gideon went into the house and prepared food, and brought it out. “And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.”—Verses 20 and 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Quite likely the angel went up in the smoke associated with the fire, as happened on another somewhat similar occasion. (Judges 13:20) At any rate, Gideon realized that the messenger was an angel, and Gideon was in fear, thinking it portended his death. The Lord comforted him and permitted him to build that day a memorial altar to his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Wrecking the Devil’s Religion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">That night the angel of Jehovah decided that the time had come to use Gideon to make a wreck of the works of the Devil, and, properly enough, his first point of attack was the Devil’s religion. He told Gideon to throw down his father’s altar of Baal, and cut down the grove adjoining it, then to build an altar to Jehovah God and to sacrifice one of his father’s bullocks as a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove. Now, that was quite an undertaking. His father was an idolater, and the times were hard. There was bound to be a family row, and the whole neighborhood would be stirred up, which was just what the angel wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gideon was afraid to do this job by day, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city; so he got ten of his servants together and decided to rip things to pieces the next night, and, scared or not scared, they did the business. The fact that he had ten servants of his own shows that he was quite an executive, and could get things done when he once got started. God knew all that when He picked him out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next morning the town was in an uproar. The Devil’s church had been wrecked. Baal’s altar had been thrown down and his grove cut up and used for firewood. Gideon was the guilty man. The men of the town came to Joash, his father, and demanded that his son be put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The old man turned out to have some sense, after all, in spite of the fact that he had been a worshiper of Baal. He suddenly put the shoe on the other foot by demanding that anybody that would plead the cause of Baal should himself be put to death while it was yet morning. He claimed, and with reason, that if Baal was a god he ought to be able to fight his own battles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With that, he called Baal a bad name, Jerub-besheth, which means ‘‘Let the shameful thing plead&quot;. It made a hit with the crowd, especially those who had been crying to Jehovah, the God of their fathers, for help, and from that moment all were on the side of Gideon. His father, rather proudly, it seems, gave him a nickname, Jerub-baal, which means ‘‘Let Baal plead’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we may be pardoned for using some of the language we occasionally see in the newspapers, ‘‘Baal took it on the chin right there, and went down for the count.” In other newspaper parlance, &quot;His stock went away below par, with nothing bid and no takers.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>It Was a Big Advertisement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It did not take long for the news to get around. The very next verse says, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Then</span><span class="font3"> [as soon as the news reached the Devil's worshipers] all the Midianites and the Amalckites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.” (Verse 33) A fresh campaign for the subjugation of the Israelites was seen to be necessary. They reasoned properly that a revolt against their gods would be quickly followed by a revolt against themselves; and that was what took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next verse tells us that the spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet (formally declared war against Israel’s oppressors) and sent messengers over the northern part of Palestine calling for volunteers. The response was prompt and satisfactory. Israel was now definitely ranged on his side, the side of Jehovah God. But despite the good start that had been made, Gideon was still timid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Obediently, Gideon had already thrown down the Devil’s religion, but now he was about to face the Devil’s military organization, and it looked so formidable that he felt the need of renewed assurance that he was to go right ahead with the program already begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thereupon he asked two more manifestations of divine approval. He would put a piece of wool fleece on the floor. The first night he prayed there might be dew on the fleece only and all around be dry; the second night, that the fleece might be dry and all around be wet. Both prayers were answered affirmatively. The first night the fleece was so wet that Gideon wrung a bowlful of water out of it; and the next night it was as dry as it had been wet the night before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this time Gideon had a fair-sized army gathered together, some 32,000 men, all told. Not a great army, as armies go, and certainly nothing as compared with the great army encamped against Israel, of which army the account says, ‘‘And the Midianites, and the Amalek-ites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand bv the sea side for multitude.’’—Judges 7:12. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And then Jehovah God, through His angel, did several things that are like God, but not at all like man. He whittled down the force to almost nothing. There were too many people in Gideon’s army; if they should have a victory they would certainly take the credit of it to themselves. The real truth that Jehovah himself is the Protector of His people would be hid from view. The blessing of the whole experience would be lost.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>Whittling Down the Army</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The first act was to invite all the fearful to leave the battlefield, and 22,000 packed up and went and were glad to go. They were on Jehovah's side, oh, yes, if there was anything to be gained by it, but not if there was any chance of ‘■being arrested and thrown into jail, and maybe killed&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now here was a good chance to quit honorably. God himself had said that if they were scared they could go home, and they were scared; there was no doubt about that. Therefore common sense said to them that the best thing they could do was to quit while the quitting was good, and away they went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was still an army of 10,000 men, and it was still too many. By the method by which they drank at the brook, God selected the 300 men that He would use in the coming victory. It would not be a battle; it would just simply be a victory for Jehovah God. But He would use a handful of honest, zealous, faithful men as coworkers with himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this time Gideon was in a frame of mind where he needed to have his backbone stiffened once more, and again the angel of Jehovah resorted to rare and effective measures to perform the stiffening work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gideon was told to go down to the edge of the Midianite camp and listen; and that if he feared, he should take a servant with him, and this he did. He made the trip, probably at night, and when he got there he overheard one man telling another about a dream. He heard his own name mentioned. He heard the dream interpreted, and the interpretation of the dream was that into the hand of Gideon, the son of Joash, God had delivered Midian and all his host.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Gideon Finally and Fully Convinced</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">That was enough for Gideon. Right where he stood he worshiped the great God that never fails His true people in time of need and that in due time will vindicate His name before all creation. Next he returned to the camp, aroused the three hundred, and told them the good news that Jehovah God had delivered into their hands the host of Midian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He divided the three hundred into three companies, and put a trumpet in every man’s hand, thus making every man a captain in the army. There were no privates. Everybody on the payroll was a full commissioned officer. Gideon was the general. Jehovah God was the Commanderin-Chief. The heavy artillery consisted of empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was good enough. It was so much better than Big Berthas, and howitzers, and machine guns, and rapid-fire rifles, and hand grenades, and poison gas, and liquid fire, that there was no comparison. For the overwhelming victory that was just ahead, the rattle of broken crockery, the flashing of candle lights in the midst of darkness that was as dark as a stack of black cats, and the weird sound of bugle calls from every direction, would be just the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And the arrangement worked! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Of course</span><span class="font3"> it worked. And the reason it worked was that the wisdom of Jehovah God, and the power of Jehovah God, were back of it. In the middle of the night the three hundred men surrounded the camp of the Midianites, blew their trumpets, broke their pitchers, and held their lights aloft. After that it was all over but the shouting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Midianites heard the broken crockery falling on the rocks, and it got on their nerves, for it sounded like a bull in a china shop, not at all particular where he went, and wreaking havoc in every direction at every plunge. They did not know there wore only three hundred pitchers. In the still of the night it sounded like a big-six fire alarm, when all the apparatus in the city comes out.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Panic in the Camp of the Enemy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jumping from their cots, wide-eyed with alarm, the Midianites heard the crockery still breaking on the rocks and were dazzled by the hundreds of lights shining upon them from every direction. They did not have electric lights in those days, and the gleam of those candle lights in the still air looked like Broadway appears to a countryman in the height of the theater season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As they pulled their swords from the scabbards the lights were reflected this way and that from every piece of metal in their equipment. The whole camp seemed ablaze with those lights. And then there were the terrifying blasts on the bugles. There were hundreds of them. That meant, to them, that a great army of thousands upon thousands must be right on top of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was enough. Here they were, right on top of him. Off goes the head of the man next to him. He does not see in the darkness that he has disposed of one of the enemies of Jehovah God, one of his own comrades. The next to go down is himself, slain by the sword of his own tent mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a moment the camp of the Midianites was in a panic, and in a panic reason leaves its throne. What had been at twilight an orderly military encampment was at midnight a thoroughly frightened mob, without a semblance of order, in which every man was striking blindly this way and that, intent only on saving his own life, or at least selling it as dearly as possible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>An Overwhelming Victory</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">We draw the curtain. In the fight, and in the skirmishes that followed, there fell 120,000 men that drew the sword. Most of these men slew one another. The number that were put to death by Gideon and his band were relatively few, though they stayed in the fight till the finish, and until the others of Israel had risen up and taken part in the conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After it was all over, and Israel had rest from her enemies, the men of Israel wanted to make Gideon their king, but Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.” The experiences he had passed through had deeply impressed upon his mind how little he had really had to do with the gaining of the great victory that had been wrought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He was one of those who had suffered at the hands of the iMidianites; we know that because he tells us of it, and because he was trying to thresh out a little grain in a place where his work would be hidden from the eyes of his exactors. And we may be sure that he was one of those who had cried to Jehovah God to come to the relief of His people. It may have been specially his cry that came to the ears of Jehovah God; likely so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lu this lesson, however, we are considering merely the subject of obedience in the case of the man Gideon. We see that as a man Gideon was naturally a timid man, and a modest man, but he was an obedient man, and therefore a man that God could use. And he was a man of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Timid but Always Obedient Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gideon has come down to us as <sup>c</sup>a mighty man of valor’, and so he was. It took a valorous man to wreck the Devil's religion at a time when the Devil had apparently the whole land under his control, and it took a valorous man to tackle an army of 200,000 with a total force of 300 men, and to chase the fugitive armies even after they were completely whipped and in full flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it is apparent that Gideon's valor lay entirely in his obedience; and that is where it lies with all the rest of us, if we have it. If we are obedient and submissive to God's will, and zealous to perform that which is entrusted to our care, then we are valorous, for the fight is a fight with the Devil and with his great organization that overshadows the whole world, and has filled it with blood and tears. But if not obedient, then all is lost, for there is no strength in the arm of clay wherewith to fight the great enemy encamped against the remnant of the people of God.</span></p>

<p><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup><a name="bookmark25"></a></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note.</span><span class="font1">—The stand maintained for the past five years by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> is scientifically proven by this article to be absolutely correct. Mr. Force was for thirteen years a pharmaceutical chemist in New York city and was thereafter chief chemist for the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp;&nbsp;Western Railroad for twenty-two years. His statements of fact cannot be denied, and the conclusion is inescapable. Aluminum cooking utensils are a curse to humanity, and their manufacture and use should be forbidden by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In what a sorry light this article puts the Federal Trade Commission, which, with full knowledge of these facts, twice tried to intimidate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> so that it might withdraw from its campaign in the interest of the welfare of the people. The only excuse offered for its intrusion into our affairs was that the aluminum trust was being injured by our activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What a miserable showing is also made by the American Medical Association, which, with every facility at its hands to know the truth, took its stand on the opposite side of this important question. Medical doctors have found space in newspapers and magazines in every corner of the land, wherein they have betrayed their willful ignorance or dishonesty or both. In some of these instances their articles bOosting uluiuinuui cooking utensils have been published alongside advertisements for the same wares. The aluminum trust has all the funds neee-.sar.v to pay well for services rendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Literal y Diiicxt, </span><span class="font1">which joined in the general parade of ignorance on this subject, let them now come forth and answer these statements of scientific evidence and literary fact or else admit that they are neither scientific nor literary nor honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is time now for the United States Government to shako off its fear of Andrew Mellon and give some attention to the needs of the people. Without being so told, it knows, of course, that the findings of the so-called ’Mellon Institute’ on this subject would have no value except to the aluminum trust. As for the American Medical Association, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American, The Literary Diyest,</span><span class="font1"> and all the other publications which have sided in with the aluminum trust, we now invite them to answer this article, and to set fact against fact, or else for ever keep still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In other words, on this aluminum cooking utensil question, the Government, and Mr. Mellon's crowd, and the medical doctors, and the papers and magazines that have trailed in their wake, can ’’either put up or shut up&quot;. Their bluff is permanently called.—L'd.</span></p>

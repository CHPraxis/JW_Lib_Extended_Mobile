<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan Takes Over Manchuria </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(in Two parts)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">INCE the Kaiser Wilhelm promoted peace in the earth by stealthily crossing the Holland border at night and taking up his residence at Doorn, we have not heard so much about anyone endeavoring or any one nation offering to take over all the affairs of the world and running them according to his or its own pleasure or fancy. It is true that we have had fulminations from Mr. Mussolini about making the European skies black with airplanes, but thus far he is comparatively peaceable and still on his own side of the fence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that the Russians claim to expect that the whole world will go into the Soviet Union, but they are trying to bring this about by the radio and the printing press rather than by machine guns and poison gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the mainland of Europe, France has taken the place of Germany as the nightmare of western civilization. What she proposes to do with great fleets of airplanes nobody knows for sure, but the British air force says that on the same day that London is attacked, Paris will be wiped off the map, and as that would dispose of both Britain and France, we are left with but two great militaristic powers in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we write, those two great powers, America in the Western world, and Japan in the Far Eastern hemisphere are glaring at each other and apparently almost ready to spring at each other’s throats. These two countries, Japan and America, have points in common. Between them they have two out of three biggest navies in the. world. They can each draw upon a reserve of millions of soldiers, and it is a curious fact that neither of these countries has ever sustained a military defeat or even been subjected to serious military reverses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan's Idea of Its Destiny</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is difficult for a Western person to picture to himself the reasoning processes of an Oriental mind, but it is a fact that there are millions of people in Japan who honestly believe that their imperial family descended from God and that it is destined ultimately to have the whole world under its sway. With this thought in mind, consider the following statement which appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Niroku,</span><span class="font5"> a Japanese newspaper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Imperial Family of Japan is as worthy of respect as is God, and is the embodiment of benevolence and justice. The Imperial Family of Japan is parent not only over 60,000,000 people, but of all mankind on earth. In the eyes of the Imperial Family all races are but one and the same. It stands above all racial considerations. All human disputes, therefore, may be settled in accordance with its immaculate justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To a westerner such a statement seems laughable, but it does not seem so amusing even to a westerner when, as now seems to be the case, Japan reaches out and puts China in its lunch basket as easily as a boy picks apples off a tree and all the while protests that she has no intention whatever of doing the very thing she is actually engaged in doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not certain that there will be war between Japan and the United States. We earnestly hope that the secretary of state, Mr. Stimson, will back down and let the Japanese have their own way in China, for they will have it anyway until the. Lord himself gets ready to stop them; but as recent exchanges of notes have been of a very threatening nature, it seems quite in order for us at this time to present to our readers some idea of what Japan and the Japanese are like, so that if a crushing defeat should await Uncle Sam in a war in the Far East some of the people here at home would not be taken entirely unawares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan Resembles British Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have noticed that the Empire of Japan, in its location off the coast of Asia, bears a striking resemblance to the British Isles located off the coast of Europe. They are about the same in area and about the same in population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These two countries have two of the three largest navies in the world, and they are considered to be the two most aristocratic countries in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As far as natural resources are concerned, Britain has much the advantage over Japan, but the latter has some offsetting advantages. Japan is a land of magnificent scenery. The sacred mountain, Fujiyama, sixty miles west of Tokyo, rises to an altitude of 12,425 feet, and there are several mountain ranges which rise to nearly 10,000 feet in height and exhibit landscapes of Alpine character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has no plains, and there are few places either far removed from the mountains or distant from the sea. The rivers are short, but as the rainfall is heavy the. streams are torrential. There are waterfalls providing scenic beauty as well as water power for industrial purposes. The “Splendor of the Sun” waterfall at Nikko makes an unbroken plunge of 350 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most beautiful bodies of water in the world is Japan’s Inland Sea, which opens both into the Sea of Japan and the Pacific. It is 255 miles long and 56 miles wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every island is indented with innumerable bays and inlets surrounded by rocky bluffs and sandy beaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total area of Japan, including colonies and mandated islands, is 261,567 square miles. At the far northern extremity of Japan there is a communistic district inhabited by some 7,500 people where for centuries the villagers have been accustomed to collecting their catch of fish and apportioning it communistically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Worship of the Mikado</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nowhere, except perhaps in Vatican City and Japan, do people actually worship their fellow men, and in the case of that at Vatican City the worship is merely that of one who is supposed to be the vicar or earthly representative of another; but in Japan the mikado is actually worshiped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every year thousands of the school children of Japan are taken to worship at the shrine of the mikado; and not only are their school books carefully prepared by the Government to instill into their minds the conviction that the emperor is a god, but the theaters, story-tellers and motion pictures are all utilized to exalt the same idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the crown prince enters the presence of the emperor he is compelled to enter the throne room through a side door and to crawl into the presence of the emperor on his hands and knees. It would be considered profanation by the Japanese to show the face of their emperor on a coin. Fifty years ago it was illegal for a citizen to look upon him at all. The emperor helps the program along by making a pilgrimage every little while to one of the shrines of Ise, or dispatches special messengers to pay respects to his ancestors and acquaint them with important affairs of state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a ruler the emperor has almost no actual power. The Government is really an oligarchy of Big Business, a group of professional rulers that use the mikado as a figurehead. In times of famine it is, theoretically, the emperor that comes forward with millions of dollars for the relief of the poor. Always he is set before the people in the best of light. Actually he is a slight, bespectacled young man in good health, now beginning his thirty-second year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hirohito, 124th occupant of the high seat reserved for ‘descendants of the sun goddess’, succeeded to the Japanese throne on December 25, 1926. He is not supposed to rule “by the grace of God”, but because Tie himself is a deit/. No law makes him an emperor, for in the eyes of the Japanese he is the law. He does not derive his power from the constitution of Japan, but he is the organized will of the state. No one may address the emperor directly. Even a cabinet officer can reach him only by arrangement with the imperial household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Slowly the Japanese masses are emerging from the shadow of this colossal superstition. Formerly all street traffic was suspended for an hour before the mikado passed through the streets, and even then the passage was through cordons of troops drawn up the length of the route. Now this suspension has been reduced to fifteen minutes and the guard is merely a police guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Formerly the emperor traveled by special train, with the railroad lined on both sides by school children, compelled to stand for hours until the train passed. But now, in view of the very crowded condition of traffic, the emperor’s coach is occasionally attached to a regular train and the people need not, as formerly, leave the station when he alights. This gradual climbing down out of the clouds must seem like an odd business to the mikado, but he probably figures that it is better to climb down than to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mikado is said to be fond of horseback riding, tennis and golf, and to be one of the expert swimmers of the country. On his trip around the world he was baptized by the pope, but this should not be charged up against him. Every morning at six o’clock he prays to his ancestors before he has his breakfast and reads the morning paper. Here’s hoping that the ancestors or whoever gets the prayer knows what to do with it in view of the fact that Mr. Hirohito has been baptized by the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Hirohito is said to be an intimate friend of the-prince of Wales. Why not? They are both in the same graft. It is like a couple of bootleggers making love to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Imperial Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The royal family in Japan is the oldest existing royal family in the world. It has had one unbroken line of sovereigns for almost 2600 years. For 1200 years the imperial family has reigned but has not governed. When the noble families one after another within these later centuries took possession of the governmental power they all governed in the name of the emperor or some member of the emperor’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is not on earth another king or emperor or priest that has such enormous reverence and love of his subjects as the mikado of Japan. The people of Japan are exceedingly proud of the fact that the reigning imperial family has descended from time immemorial in an unbroken line of succession to the present. The imperial family stands in Japan as the emblem and symbol of national immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the constitutions of Europe and America were protests against the encroachment of a sovereign upon people’s rights, the Japanese constitution was a gift to the people in 1890 and was freely offered to them before they had ever dreamed of having a parliament of their own. But the mikado was wise in his day and generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He personally declares war, makes peace and concludes treaties, with the advice and assistance of the cabinet ministers whom he appoints and who are responsible to him. He has supreme command of the army and navy and determines the organization and personnel of both. Like the king of England, he has a privy council of elder statesmen, the decisions of which are above those of parliament and frequently contrary to the wishes of parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No revolution has ever deprived a Japanese monarch of his throne. The Japanese people feel that if the politicians, soldiers and statesmen do make mistakes and exploit them and others to their injury, yet they are protected against these selfish men by the emperor’s exclusive power to decide when and how many of his subjects shall be used for war purposes outside the realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through the ages occasional adopted sons have assumed their father’s titles. This has prevented the imperial family from running out, because in Japan an adopted child has the same rights as a natural child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now it happens that emperors of the imperial family are human, like the rest of us. They have their likes and dislikes, and when the crown prince who is now the emperor wanted to marry the girl of his choice in spite of the opposition of his elders, 15,000 men of Tokyo marched to a shrine to offer a prayer for the young man that he might have the girl of his choice. And so, for the first time in Japanese history, a crown prince selected his own bride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few years later, Hirohito’s brother, heir presumptive to the throne, fell in love with a girl who had no title, and in this case the objection was overcome by the young woman’s being adopted by her uncle, a viscount, so he could act as her father at the wedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a child is born in the imperial family of Japan it is a time of great excitement. The priests and seers, and other dignitaries, who do not know any more what they are about than a cat on the backyard fence knows about astronomy, study the stars and the month of birth so as to try to fit the poor kid with a name which will be suitable to the high place it is supposed to occupy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Japanese Caste System</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the Devil did not push the caste system of Japan to anything like the extremes to which he pushed it in India, still up until less than a century ago there was a rigid division of society into four groups: soldiers, farmers, artisans and merchants, whose social standing was in the order named. Above the soldiers were the imperial family and the nobles in a class by themselves, and below the merchants were the outcasts : shoemakers, tanners, embalmers and grave diggers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The castes have not been kept as rigidly separate in Japan as in India. While intermarriages between the castes have not been legal, yet concubinage has been very common and the children of these unions have frequently become the heirs of their fathers and thus the blood of the aristocracy of Japan has been enriched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, during the wars preceding the seventeenth century, many aristocratic families were ruined and forced into the lower classes, so that the common people received a perpetual influx of aristocratic blood. These facts explain why some Japanese aristocrats are very progressive, and why the common people of Japan are so aristocratic and love aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another curious principle operates to bring about a certain sympathy between the common people and the aristocrats. If the children of an aristocrat are lacking in intelligence and responsibility it is a common practice to adopt children who do have such characteristics, and upon adoption they have all the rights of natural children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By these means the aristocrats of Japan have managed to keep about everything in the country in their own hands. Of the eleven multimillionaires in Japan, i.e., of those who pay more than 1,000,000 yen a year in income tax, six belong to the Mitsui family and two to the Iwasaki family. Formerly the people were in the habit of selling themselves for long terms of years into the service of the rich and ‘noble’. Sometime prior to the year 1872 the government limited the term of engagement of servants to ten years, and in 1872 cut the term down to one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pathetic incident happened at Nagoya, in November, 1927, in connection with Emperor Hirohito’s review of the troops. A soldier, a member of the Eta, or outcast class, stepped from the ranks, knelt and tried to draw the emperor’s attention to a petition he held for intervention in favor of better treatment for the outcast class. He was immediately arrested and sentenced to a year’s imprisonment. As illustrating the abject submission of the Japanese people to their sovereign, all the officers of the regiment in which this poor man was serving tendered their resignations because of the “disgrace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Accustomed to Strict Discipline</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese people are accustomed to a discipline that would be irksome to a Briton or an American. In Japan everyone must carry an identification disk of some kind, which disk is worn around the neck. Apart from the convenience in cases of accident, it is a safeguard against loss of memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persons wishing to drive an auto down a street at night must ask the policeman on the corner for permission. Then follows a regular catechism. The policeman wants to know the name of the person, his address, where he is going and why, where he has been, and what he. is going to do when he leaves. Then he may or may not allow him to go down the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When persons actually living on the street come home late at night the policeman wants to know where they have been and why they did not come home sooner. When the information has been obtained, the late comer is generally given a lecture on going to bed early. A Japanese policeman may strike a man or woman of his own race who refuses to answer his questions, and nothing will be done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present regime is the most liberal that Japan has ever enjoyed, but it still leaves much to be desired by foreigners. No foreigner may open a law office in Japan, although there are. Japanese barristers in America and Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No foreign ships are allowed to carry passengers or freight between ports of Japan, although Japanese boats ply between the. ports of other nations; and a foreigner in Japan may not even own a motor boat in his own name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent years, political scandals in Japan have caused the people to lose all confidence in the political parties and yet when some so-called “radicals” issued circulars saying, “We must expose crimes of capitalists and landowners,” the mikado’s government put 1,000 of them in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Communism is dealt with severely. Out of 173, all of whom were found guilty and punished, ninety-three were students and thirty-one were graduates of the Imperial University of Tokyo. Apparently the best minds in Japan believe what ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1928 universal manhood suffrage went into effect and the number of eligible voters was increased from 500,000 to 13,000,000. A bill granting the municipal vote to women has passed the lower house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan Bombarding Shanghai</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had gotten just this far with this article when the monthly fire drill ushered us all out into the street and there for the first time the news venders were in the streets hawking newspapers with the glaring headline “Japanese Bombard Shanghai”. This is just what we expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Apologists point out that, in the twenty-five hundred years in which it has existed as an empire, Japan has engaged in only three foreign wars, all of which have been within the last forty years; and that for two hundred years before Commodore Perry opened Japan to intercourse with other nations, in 1853, she had not had any kind of war, civil or foreign. However, this does not change the fact that the ancient heroes of Japan, the Samurai, so called, were all militarists, supposedly mighty with the sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was somewhat similarly the case in Germany, it is still the rule in Japan, that the toys of the boy babies are military toys, tiny swords, spears, bows and arrows, sold on certain days at certain shrines as a part of the “worship”; and the boys wear caps of military form to impress upon them the idea that when they grow up they are to be soldiers of the mikado, fighting for the Japanese variety of the “Me und Gott” swindle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the exception of Germany in the days of the kaiser, there has never been a nation that has had the ‘glory of war’ drilled into them from earliest infancy the way it has been drilled into the Japanese. Stories of the Japanese war with Russia and of the exploits of military heroes of previous wars are taught and repeated by every child from the time he enters primary school. The typical movie usually involves sword play and fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has been under military instruction since 1870, and is saturated with the philosophy of “Kultur” that “might makes right”. During the war, although they drove the Germans out of Kiao Chau in accordance with their treaty with Great Britain, the people as a whole were fully in sympathy with Germany and fully expected her to win the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While in Japan, the German prisoners of war were treated with marked consideration, and when the German flag was again raised over the Yokohama consulate there was a public celebration of large proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was the case in Germany, so in Japan, there is an overbearing military caste, bent on committing the nation to great foreign undertakings. The men in charge of this machine are not, as was the kaiser, ordained ministers in the Lutheran church, nor in any church. They accept none of the principles of the Christian religion and literally fear neither God, man, nor the Devil. They admire frightfulness, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was the case in Germany, so in Japan, the sword ciankers have been everywhere. It is scarcely ten years since railway officials and station masters ceased wearing swords, and military men keep coming and going constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the great masses of the people is the settled conviction (due to belief in the military teachers and the successful prosecution of wars against China, Russia and Germany) that Japan holds the place she has among the nations because of her capacity for war. This is literally true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hyenas masquerading as Christian nations have all shown by their acts that their chief reliance is upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">force,</span><span class="font5"> and this applies all the way from Great Britain, with her mighty battleships, down to the pope, with his machinegun battalion of Swiss Guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Selling the Idea of War</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Militarism is said to be much less popular with the common people in Japan than it was some, years ago. The defeat of Germany was a setback for the militarists, and popular sentiment is against the extensive use of the Japanese army on the Asiatic continent. Applications for admission to the officers’ training schools have also fallen off materially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless, the mass of the people are still with the militarists; and the General Staff can and does undertake operations without the consent or even the knowledge of the premier, so that his most solemn promise on any subject affecting their movements counts for no more than did their own lightly-held promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Years ago, foreseeing the partial awakening of the people, the military party of Japan had the ministers of war and navy made responsible, not to the premier, but directly to the emperor, or those who represent him, so that any criticism of either army or navy becomes a criticism of the emperor ‘and thus of God’—a long-headed scheme to continue the time-honored policy of Satan to make independent thinkers guilty of blasphemy and sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Americans well remember how they were sold into the World War. A group of men high up in the newspaper world made up a list of the twenty-five newspapers which control American public opinion. The editorial policy of those papers was bought, and when they began to churn for war the whole country went insane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Something like that has been done in Japan. The newspapers began to carry large advertisements explaining Japan’s interests in Manchuria and how the Chinese were injuring them. These advertisements went over big, and today Japan is mad for another war of aggression against China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese claim that their first suggestions of militarism came from the flags and glistening swords of French, British and German warships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has universal military service beginning at the age of twenty and lasting for sixteen months, but only one out of every seven eligible young men is called to the colors. First there are eliminations by physical examination, by exemption of those necessary for family support or enrolled as students, and finally lots are. drawn as to who will actually render army service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has been sending heavy gold shipments through San Francisco for months past. This indicated plainly her intention to buy in America the materials with which she would murder the Chinese in Asia; for gold is the money of the international murderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese government does not have the money to conduct a great military campaign, but always when there are wars to be fought the Devil will find some way to finance them, and we. have plenty of people here in America who will give the Japanese all the money they want for any purpose of that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Secrets of Japan’s fortified airports are jealously guarded, not only from foreigners, but from the Japanese people themselves. It is only a few months since two American pilots who flew over fortified areas without permission, and took photographs, underwent a long examination and were heavily fined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a consideration of the warlikeness of Japan it cannot be too greatly emphasized that the Japanese government itself has no power or authority over the Japanese military forces. The Japanese, army and navy are responsible to nobody except the emperor, and that means they are responsible to nobody at all. The war minister (always a general) and the navy minister' (always an admiral) in the cabinet at Tokyo are merely the clerks of the General Staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chinese believe that before we get through with it we shall have to fight the Japanese as they have had to fight them, because, says Eugene Chen, Chinese foreign minister, “Japan, after an annexation of Manchuria, expects to dominate the entire. Asiatic mainland and to undertake the conquest of Australia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Many Japanese Are Peace-Loving</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the Japanese General Staff has the power to plunge the Japanese people into war at any time, and while they would not hesitate to avail themselves of that power and to make all of their warlike moves seem plausible and reasonable to the bulk of the people, yet it must not be supposed that the Japanese are a nation of fire-eaters any more than was the case with the Germans. In both instances the common people have been misled, mistaught and helped to choose a course contrary to their best interests and to the best interests of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The General Staff is so far removed from the people that the Tokyo Government actually forbade the dispatch of troops to Manchuria and at the very same time troops and munitions were sent in transport to the scene of conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A newspaper correspondent who spent ten years in Japan states as a result of his observations that the bulk of the people are at heart peace-loving, that military training is unpopular, and that in numerous instances boys mutilate themselves in some minor way in order to obtain military exemption. Out of 100 Japanese youths whom he questioned as to whether or not they wished to go into the army or navy<sup>7</sup>, only two answered yes. All the others answered no, but all acknowledged they were ready to serve in case of necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until the General Staff published its advertisements setting forth Japanese needs and rights in Manchuria, there were two papers, each with a circulation of more than a million, urging against war in Manchuria and declaring that Japan is not fighting and does not intend to fight China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the publication of these advertisements, however, in the month of August last, the tone of the papers and the attitude of the government and of the people underwent a great change, and an attempt at a pacifist demonstration in Tokyo was broken up by police and more than 200 participants were jailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An argument that Japan is not as militaristic as it is generally supposed in the. United States is that when Germany proposed a through air mail service via Singapore if the Japanese would operate the line from Singapore, the offer was declined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Land of Heavy Rainfall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As would be expected of a kingdom surrounded on all sides by water, Japan has an abundant rainfall. The island of Formosa on the south is in the same latitude as Cuba, while the island of Saghalin in the north is in the same latitude as Newfoundland. There is therefore a wide range of climate; as in the British Isles, there is a succession of mists and gently falling rains, so much so that a carefully kept record showed 226 wet days out of 365.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the winter the cold winds from the northwest bring the moisture of the Sea of Japan in the form of enormous deposits of snow on the northern coast of central Japan. Sometimes in the mountain districts these snows amount to more than ten feet during the winter season, and then whole towns and villages are nearly buried. These heavy snows are cleared away with great difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the southern isles there are no snows, but the rains are excessive. In late summer and early fall, violent hurricanes called typhoons cause terrible damage, especially to rice crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like the people of the British Isles, the Japanese have so much rain that they get used to it and apparently enjoy sloshing around in the cold and wet. People who have been in Tokyo or Kyoto, where until recently sidewalks were almost unknown, describe the streets as, during the most of the year, virtually seas of mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese names for spring, summer, autumn and winter are, respectively: the time of blossoms, the time of rain, the time of the moon, and the time of snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dress and Housing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ancient Japanese dress was exceedingly picturesque, and as uncomfortable as it was picturesque. Western clothes are now worn by the men, and as the children are being dressed in Western clothes it is probable that by the time they grow up the ancient customs of dress will be a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A traveler reports a happening on a railway train on a day in midsummer three years ago. A Japanese gentleman noticed that his silk shirt was w<sup>r</sup>et with perspiration. He arose in his seat and removed it. Finding that his underwear was also wet with perspiration, he removed that, and from his suitcase produced clean underwear and a clean shirt, which he donned with entire unconcern. An occurrence like this would attract no special attention in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until recently, at the public bathing resorts the men, women and children bathed together dressed entirely in the suits originally provided for Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. When some westerners lifted up holy hands in horror at this procedure, the. Japanese rectified the matter by having the men and women bathe separately. A rope was stretched between the part where the men bathed and where the women bathed, but all were dressed as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not long ago a group of twenty-four natives from the South Sea Islands paid a visit to Japan. When they first arrived in Tokyo they were barefooted and a shoe salesman got hold of the crowd and convinced them they must' be civilized and wear shoes. Within an hour every one of these natives had thrown away the new shoes and remained barefooted during the balance of their stay in Japan. How some of the rest of us would like to go back to the days when we were privileged to go barefooted, if only we dared!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan is without homes in the sense in which westerners understand the term. The houses are without solid walls, ceilings, doors or windows, tables or chairs, beds or cook stoves, pots or pans. They are of light bamboo construction. The partitions are mere sliding screens easily removed. In fine weather the outside walls are taken away during the day. Mats suffice for beds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no home fires burning in the winter, and the people suffer terribly with the cold. The Japanese object to heat in their homes because it warps delicate wood and lacquer and furniture unglues, cups chip, beams split, paper rolls up, and family treasures wrinkle and crack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese families do not move from one house or apartment to another, but live in the same places year after year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ghastly Ceremony of Seppuku</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up until 1868, when the ceremony was abolished, the mikado had a nice way of parting with friends that he had ceased to appreciate. Some fine morning a noble in the midst of his family would receive from the emperor a jeweled dagger accompanied by a courteously phrased note informing him that he had been assigned to the great honor of committing hara-kiri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He was then supposed to erect a platform in the largest hall in his home. This was covered with red plush and he stood upon it, while his friends and the representatives of the mikado stood around in a semicircle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the dagger was presented to him it was then his duty to thrust it into his left side, draw it to the right and up. As he did this, one of his friends obligingly removed his head from his shoulders. In this way the mikado used to dispose of about 500 of the old-timers each year to create promotion for younger and more ambitious men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In ancient Japanese anatomy the &quot;solar” plexus was believed to be the seat of the “soul”, and the idea of carving up the matter in front of it was to give the “soul” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘a</span><span class="font5"> chance to get out in a hurry, which it was no doubt glad to do’. Hara-kiri or seppuku is still sometimes practiced by women as well as men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This diabolical device of the Devil to keep himself and his crowd in power has had much to do with making the Japanese a tragedy-loving people. No play is considered a success in Japan unless it makes the people weep. It is said that the American film comedies gave them their first good laugh. No doubt, too, the practice of seppuku has had much to do with making the Japanese ruthless in their treatment of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Horrors of Jiu Jitsu</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are in the human body some thirty-four vulnerable points, any one of which if suddenly pressed or struck will render a person permanently helpless. Jiu jitsu, a Japanese art, is a scientific study of 160 movements or fouls by which the death or disability of an opponent may be caused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A person of light weight and short stature who knows jiu jitsu is more than a match for a person of twice the weight who does not know it. One jiu jitsu movement is to rest the palm of the hand over the mouth of an opponent and push up on the nose with the forefinger on one side of the nose, and the middle finger on the other. It is said that no athlete is able to endure the pain that comes from such an attack upon the nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jiu jitsu is not a system of muscle building by physical training, but rather a means of offsetting the effectiveness of powerful muscles, by performing the most skillful yet simple maneuvers. The United States government has recognized its importance as science by having it taught at West Point and Annapolis as a special training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a scientific application of the knowledge of the weaker spots in the. human anatomy to offense and defense. Such spots as the “funny bone” are utilized to down an adversary; fingers are bent backward; an opponent's onward rush is utilized to trip him; he. is encouraged to uncover an armpit; he is pressed in the gland below and back of the ear; in short, every trick that would be accounted “foul” in wrestling and boxing is the height of excellence in jiu jitsu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One who is expert in jiu jitsu, and most Japanese are thus expert, can strike a blow with the edge of the palm opposite the. thumb that will split the skull of an opponent or break his neck. The same kind of blow is used to break the bones in the forearm and in the legs. One of the horrible movements of jiu jitsu is to break the opponent’s elbow backward, leaving him in unspeakable agony and helpless for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one time lessons were given to the police in New York in jiu jitsu, but it was finally concluded that when they lost their heads they would do less harm with their guns and clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japanese Characteristics</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt the Japanese are the most cleanly people in the world. A native who apologized to a westerner for bathing but twice a day in summer on account of being extremely busy, replied in answer to question that in winter he bathed four or five times daily. Compare this with the good old Saturday night bath of our ancestors!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese love sobriety and simplicity. They are by nature, disinclined to ostentation. Loyalty to the mikado or to any other master is believed to be the most deeply imbedded virtue of the Japanese race. What a wonderful people they will be when their loyalty is turned in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan is ultra-patriotic, having 51 patriotic societies that are boosters of militarism first, last and all the time. Their fortitude in suffering and their loyalty to the mikado, coupled with their high intelligence, make the Japanese one of the strongest, most united nations of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese fathers and mothers do not kiss their children, and yet there is no land where the obedience of children to parents is more marked or where ancestor worship has gone, to greater lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are severely anti-foreign, and yet they take instinctively to Western dress and ways. They have no swear-words in their language, and seldom give vent to words of anger or irritation; yet they have shown that they can be extremely vindictive and cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the recent fighting in Manchuria, in one place the Chinese shot down a Japanese plane. The Japanese planted explosives under it and then retired. When the Chinese approached, the Japanese exploded the mine and twenty or thirty Chinese were killed. This was reported as a typical Japanese procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">European and American music, including American jazz, is very much appreciated in Japan. The Japanese people not only sing the Western popular songs, but keep on singing them long after they have ceased to be sung in America or Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan’s Wonderful Growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese population remained stationary for centuries, but about 1868, when the mikado’s new policy went into effect, large families were urged and large families there, were. The result is that in Japan proper, the area of which is 148,756 square miles, or a little more than that of California, the population in 1930 was 64,450,005. The population of the entire empire is estimated at about 90,000,000. In proportion to arable land, the Japanese population is the densest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like the people of Great Britain, the Japanese love to remain in their homeland. They have been made unwelcome in New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but have colonies in Peru and Brazil, and there are thousands of Japanese in the Dutch East Indies. Emigration to Brazil has fallen off from 5,500 a year to a total of only 1,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By agreement with Canada, Japan voluntarily restricts the number of emigrants into Canada to 150, exclusive of domestic servants. The. Cuban Government refused to allow a Japanese firm to establish a staff of rice experts in Cuba, on the grounds that it would not care to have a large Japanese immigration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The birth rate in Japan is not going down, but it is still going up, and the population is increasing by nearly a million every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan and Hawaii</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population of Hawaii is 368,336, of whom 139,631 are Japanese. This large Japanese population was brought into Hawaii at the request of American sugar manufacturers, who persuaded the Hawaiian Government to solicit the Japanese Government to send them. The Japanese have found the climate congenial and evidently expect to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the annexation of Hawaii many of the Japanese there came to the mainland, as they call the United States, attracted thither by the relatively high wages. In a few years they have, by their superior industry, ability and resourcefulness, taken over most of the hotel, wholesale grocery and movie business of Seattle, the Alaskan fisheries, a generous share of the Hood Biver apple district, 85 percent of the Bocky Ford melon business of Colorado, and are now in large numbers in the wonderful Imperial Valley of California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan’s density of population as compared with her total area is nominally surpassed by England, Belgium and Holland, but there is very little land in any of those countries that cannot be cultivated; while the cultivable land in Japan is only about one-seventh of the total area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We thus have in Japan a density of population of about 3,000 per square mile of cultivable land, a condition unlike that to be found elsewhere in the world, the inhabitants obtaining their food from less than a quarter of an acre per capita. This is three times the population density of Germany and India, and twelve times that of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese have enough cold weather in Japan without moving into the maritime districts of Siberia, where it is colder still, and as the Bussians have not been very enthusiastic in encouraging Japanese immigration, there is no immediate likelihood of large Japanese, colonies in that portion of the Asiatic mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As practically all the rest of the world is full, it has seemed inevitable to the Japanese that they should expand through Korea into Manchuria,. and that is just what they have done. The only other way out seems to be birth control, and that is now being widely discussed in the press and a government commission has been appointed to study it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present Japan is badly overcrowded. Every industry is overmanned, and every business enterprise overstaffed. Under the circumstances, it is believed that big business in the United States and Great Britain is really not averse to having the Japanese do with China what Britain and America have done all over the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time the Japanese army made a drive into Manchuria, it was estimated that there were about a million Japanese out of work. Big business, at least in Japan, would have sense enough to figure that if they couldn’t do anything else with their surplus men they could use them for cannon fodder. Occasionally one hears that sentiment expressed here in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japan’s Women</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The doing of the work of the home in factories has done the same thing in Japan that it has done in every other country. It has driven the women into business, and as a consequence Japanese women are today acting as conductors, taxi drivers, stenographers, messengers, nurses, teachers, waitresses, clerks and mill operatives and there are some 6,000,000 women engaged in agricultural pursuits. Japan has 300 women who are doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two hundred thousand young girls a year are brought from the country into the textile factories. It is estimated that only eighty thousand of these ever return to the paternal roof, quite a few with consumption, due to long hours and insufficient food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese men are supposed to be very polite, but are reported as not hesitating to crowd working girls off the sidewalks, though they think more of their own women folk than of the women of other races and nationalities, and seldom marry white women or vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A poster published by women in Japan asked husbands to get up at the same time as wives; not to scold wives in the presence of visitors or children; to let wives know when they leave home, where they go, and when they will return; to fix sums for wives’ personal use; to refrain from demanding services which they can perform for themselves; to avoid setting children a bad example; to allow wives certain hours for reading and studying, and to avoid calling wives disrespectful names. The attention of American husbands is called to these suggestions. They will bear study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese women are doing everything that other women are doing in the way of bobbed hair, modern dress, painted lips and cigarette smoking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The movement for freeing the licensed women of Japan gained impetus by the Japanese earthquake. of 1923 because of sympathy aroused for the great numbers who died in locked rooms. In 1872 Japan officially freed licensed women, but vested interests have thus far successfully connived with corrupt police and judiciary in maintaining the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">status quo.</span><span class="font5"> Many women are still sold into professional vice, but are not now displayed in cages as was customary prior to 1872.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In August, 1927, the then Premier of Japan, Giichi Tanaka, celebrated the birth of his first son. The fact that the lady who presented him with this addition to his family was not his legal wife w’as not considered worthy of any particular comment in Japan, where concubines and mistresses are still permitted to the noble and the wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In each family there is a legally recognized head who has the reins of domestic government. Moreover, a council held by relatives is authorized and recognized by the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average height of Japanese men is about five feet three inches, but within the past twenty or thirty years the stature has increased somewhat, due to the more natural lives of their mothers prior to the time of their birth. The shortness of the Japanese is not in the body, but in the legs. It is believed that the custom of squatting on mats instead of sitting on chairs is partly responsible for this. Japanese acrobats are famous throughout the world for their strength and skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japanese Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fourteen; and as children between these ages may not be employed to the neglect of their education, Japan is really occupying a higher educational plane than the United States. According to the latest statistics 94 percent of boys and 97 percent of girls of school age are studying in schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first seven books which the Japanese child uses in his studies there is but one reference to any foreign country, and that is an uncomplimentary one. Uniformity of thought is aimed at in art, literature, religion and politics, and that uniformity must be in line with the Government’s ideas. (America has had some of that in late years, too; so do not become too much excited over the way the poor Japanese have been hoodwinked.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Multitudes of the children have been led to believe, and do believe, that the electric light, steamboat and street car are all Japanese inventions which have been copied by foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As students the Japanese are famous for their industry and ability. When at school, in their own country or abroad, they never allow athletics or social affairs to come, between them and their studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a Japanese boy goes away to school in America or Europe he is conducted to the railway station by all his relatives and all their friends and acquaintances, and they bestow presents upon him according to their means and their intimacy of acquaintance. When he returns, the youth must remember each of these gifts appropriately, and woe betide him if the return gifts omit anybody or fail of substantially equaling in value those which he received at departure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1924 Japan had five imperial universities and eleven other institutions of university rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In its issue of January 5,1930, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> said concerning Japan, “The universities and colleges are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of the country.” On September 21, 1930, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> Magazine said, “The chances for young men in Japan are narrow enough, and, as here, there are too many universities and too many graduates who have spent four years in unfitting themselves for work unsuited to their capacities and natural tastes.” Thus, if you are to believe the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font5">Japan has not enough universities and has too many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To straighten the matter out, let us explain that almost every young Japanese wants a university education, believing that thus he will stand a better chance in life. As a matter of fact, however, everything is overcrowded and fully half the graduates of universities find it difficult to secure employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The language of Japanese commerce is English, and it is a required study in the. secondary schools. In the high schools the Bible as an English textbook is included among compulsory studies. Japan has 3,000 men and women teaching English, and this has been going on for years. Many of the universities admit girls as “visitors”, but these “visitors” are not counted as regular university graduates even when they complete their courses with high standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total enrollment in all schools and colleges of Japan is now about 12,000,000, and illiteracy has been reduced below 1 percent. In 1927 it was seven-tenths of one percent (.7%). The Japanese are greater readers than the Americans. Their bookstores abound and are filled with serious books. Teachers are under the control of the government, and their teaching is closely supervised. Some years ago, women teachers who bobbed their hair and wore too stylish clothes were dismissed from their posts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The largest institution of learning in Japan is Waseda University, where several times in recent years as many as 13,000 students have gone on strike at one time. There is said to be a great deal of student drunkenness in Japan, there being several thousand bars in Tokyo alone which cater almost exclusively to student trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Newspapers and Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in America, so in Japan, there is a press, engaged in doing about the same class of work that the American press did during the war. Many of these papers are largely devoted to fanning resentment against whatever people the Government is at the time fighting or planning to fight. There is a censorship, always in operation, controlling incoming and outgoing news to suit the purposes of the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Broadcasting is controlled by a Bureau of Communications and supported by license fees on radio receiving sets. These fees amount to $9 a year on sets. It was estimated in 1929 that there were 550,000 receiving sets in use in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the year 1930 and perhaps until even now, the Japanese Government was disturbed by the daily broadcasting of radical teachings in perfect Japanese from some unknown and mysterious radio station. Quite probably this radio station was located somewhere on the Asiatic mainland, and quite probably there is somebody at Moscow who knows where the station is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is some radicalism in Japan, but the idea that the emperor has descended from the gods has such a hold upon the people’s mind that it does not make much headway. It is said that radical literature of all kinds is eagerly devoured and that magazines whose owners are not really radical print radical matter because of unprecedented demand for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Japanese Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As long as one gives the mikado the first place, he can believe almost anything else he likes, Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism or “Christianity”. Japan has twelve kinds of Buddhists, thirteen kinds of Shintoists, and twelve kinds of “Christians”. The Buddhists have the greatest number, 51,511,100. There are more Greek Catholics than Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists and Congregationalists combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one desires, in Japan, he may be a Shintoist, Buddhist and Confucianist all at the same time. Confucianism is regarded as largely a code of ethics, and Buddhism has accepted all the Shinto gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Japan there is no conflict between state and church, because the state existed first. Every prominent religious body is given a kind of state patronage. Shinto is the religion of patriotism and has 171,725 shrines where the emperor and his ancestors can be venerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> Magazine says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every Japanese house contains a small shrine where the names of dead members of the family are displayed. Flowers are placed before it, and there every Japanese begins the day with a momentary act of worship in which he remembers the dead. On family anniversaries and death days there are more solemn observances. The reverence for ancestors is common in Japan among both Christians and non-Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As missionary efforts in all eastern countries are largely along the lines of secular education, the Japanese apparently concluded that in some way the uniting of religion and education made for the prosperity of the white races, and have attempted, as in other lines, to steal the white man’s thunder. They have done this, in part, by printing Buddhist “Bibles”, many passages in which are copied from the Holy Scriptures, with the name “Buddha” inserted in place of the name “Jesus”. Little children are also taught to sing, “Buddha loves me, this I know,” etc., in place of “Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once each year, in August, the Japanese have a feast in honor of the Devil. At that time everything is done to propitiate him, so as to induce him to favor relatives who are supposedly already in hell, as well as to make him good-humored toward themselves when they arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It isn’t only the human ancestors that are remembered, but in 1927 a Japanese firm engaged in the pearl business erected a memorial “in memory of the oysters whose lives have been sacrificed for the pearls which have enabled the firm to prosper”. If this had happened a few years nearer the World War, we would have been inclined to think that this is where Big Business got the idea of erecting cenotaphs to mark the graves of the unknown soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japan has adopted Christmas and Santa Claus, and they mean the same in Japan as they do in America; i.e., they have a purely heathen and purely commercial significance. At Christmas time Tokyo department stores announce Christmas sales and impersonations of Santa Claus are frequently seen on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese have adopted the Gregorian calendar, but their New Year’s celebration lasts for two weeks. Several of the old-time customs survive. One ceremony of the New Year festival is the scattering of parched beans in four directions with the words, “Out with the devils; in with the good luck.” In many doorways is seen the straw rope, hung ‘to keep the sun goddess in the household’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On summer evenings, men, women and children engage in the sport of hunting fireflies. This is one of the few occasions when native conventionality allows men and women to mingle freely and informally. The insect, once captured, is carefully guarded from harm because supposed to be a reincarnation of a lovelorn spirit from the unseen.</span></p>

This is done by placing the bonds on sale and instructing certain employees to bid so much this morning and then buy at the price quoted, and tomorrow morning to bid so much higher. When the market was established the bonds were sent to the country banks, and as soon as it was apparent that the Germans could not pay even the interest on them they failed, as a matter of course; but meantime the big fellows had made their full profits on the sale, which was all they wanted and all they cared about.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">R. Thornwell Jacobs, president of Oglethorpe University, is unconvinced that there is any profit in murder. He reasons this way: The first effect of the World War was the destruction of all markets for American goods; then the Allies gained control of the Atlantic ocean and made huge purchases in America, with incident profits immense in size realized here. Then the. Allies were virtually whipped and America, in order to save her profits, went into the war, and in so doing loaned thousands of millions of dollars with the understanding that it would be paid back after the war. After the war the banks loaned other thousands of millions of dollars to our former enemies. Now all of these loans, national and individual, are in jeopardy, and the profits have disappeared in the greatest deflation ever known. The conclusion is that whether it is right or not, it is very doubtful if any money is to be made out of murder.</span></p>

But suppose all the police should suddenly decide to execute those whom they suspect of having liquor in their possession, beginning, let us say, at Washington. What havoc might be wrought! But they might not stop there. They might start killing everybody suspected of violating some law, and surely that would end the. lives of many policemen, because the Wickersham Report furnishes abundant evidence that lawlessness on the part of the police themselves has much to do with lawlessness all over the country. We wonder under what law a policeman operates when he shoots dead a man he suspects of having liquor with him.</span></p>

It is believed that this huge extra supply of cotton under such circumstances indicates the Japanese purpose to make gun cotton on a scale calling for major operations to make use of it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Becomes of Our Earnings? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By R. W. Stiffey (Pennsylvania)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">F EVERY man earned what he got and everyman got what he earned, there would be no farm problem, no labor problem, and no hard times for workers. This would be the situation under nature’s law, the law of God. But under human laws and institutions which transgress nature’s law and contravene the will of God, we find a very different situation. It is notorious that workers do not get what they earn, and equally apparent that many others get what they do not earn. Who gets our earnings, anyhow?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people’s earnings are of two kinds, separate and distinct from each other: social and individual. Social or community earnings, the earnings of the people collectively, landlords get. These earnings are represented and capitalized in land values. They are measured and computed by the difference in the value of the land of this country when the Indians roamed these hills and plains and its value now. Land, economically considered, includes all natural resources and all opportunities attached to land. The land values of New York city afford a striking and pertinent illustration of the social earnings of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the presence, needs and activities of the people, all the people, that gives rise to land values and that has created this stupendous difference. From practically no value the growth of population, by increasing the need and demand for land, has given the land of this nation a capitalized value of many billions: an annual value, in ground rent, of $13,000,000,000. This money the people earned. The owners had no more to do in creating this fund than anyone else. It mattered not if they were invalids, nitwits, infants or aliens, the growth in value kept right on, due to social activity and growth. But these social earnings, this public fund, instead of going into the public treasuries, where it most obviously belongs, goes into the pockets of a specially privileged class, landlords. We thus know what becomes of our social earnings. They are a total loss. They are utterly misappropriated and squandered. This fund, $13,000,000,000, is quite a tidy sum. It would pay all taxes, municipal, state and national. What a relief it would be to the people to be entirely tax free!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This common fund, socially earned, arises by divine ordinance, by virtue of a natural law in human progress as apparent and as constant and certain in its operation as the law of gravitation in physics, and is most obviously designed for common needs, for social purposes. As some one aptly said (I think it was Tom L. Johnson), “God Almighty has from the beginning paid all taxes.” But by human conventions the goodness of God is often diverted from its course and His blessings fail to reach those for whom they were provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though our system of land tenure may be superior to those in other civilized lands, it still permits the monopoly of land in private hands with power to deprive all others of their natural, inalienable rights therein. Landlords are thus enabled and permitted to waylay and appropriate these social earnings, the tax fund of the people, and, of course, do so. Contrary to and in defiance of natural law, it is thus by human enactment diverted from public treasuries into private pockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If these social earnings were applied to social purposes, were used in payment of all taxes, as they should be, would we then have our individual earnings unimpaired and be permitted to enjoy them in full? Some seem to think so; that this is all that is necessary to give us economic freedom. I fear they are too sanguine. To socialize social wealth would be a magnificent start. It is, without doubt, the one best thing to do. Its indirect results would be most beneficent. Injustice would be hampered and impeded on every front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would be freed from the direct exactions of government. But its indirect exactions through its special-privileged classes would continue. Some robbers would be left; there would remain usury with all its fraudulent and larcenous devices, public utility monopolies, the banking or money monopoly, the protective tariff monopoly, and that monopoly which arises from and is attached to vast aggregations of capital which from their very size and consequent power shut out and preclude competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our equal right to the use of nature’s bounty, the land, provided for all alike, being our fundamental right, its denial is the fundamental wrong. If all other robbers were banished and the land monopolist left, it would eventually afford us little or no relief. If land monopoly were abolished, all other monopolies would, no doubt, get a distinct shock and be much weakened. But it is difficult to see and hard to believe that they would be destroyed or even so stricken that they would eventually perish. They would still need further and very serious and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">devoted attention. At present the aggregate loot of individual earnings by the various devices of legalized special privilege far exceeds the whole of our social earnings. Even landlords look lilxe pikers when seen in the company of the kings of high finance, public utility magnates and the lords of our protected industries. We know approximately, at least, what landlords take from the earnings of the people. What these others take we can only guess. But we can be quite certain that it is more, very much more, than landlords get; not what they get in gross, but what they get over and above fair payment for any honest service they render. This is not merely theory. It is a condition. They have the wealth and are even now joyfully gathering it in. The people who earned it, whose labor produced it, do not have it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Scene in the Municipal Building</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HAT must have been a great scene in the Municipal Building, New York city, when Mayor Walker tried to find out why the big bankers would not lend the greatest city in the world any money on what is generally conceded to be the best municipal risk on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mayor Walker had invited representatives of seven of the biggest banking houses to attend. They tried to tell him that nobody is now buying any bonds, and that they are not under the obligation to lend the city anything, and that, anyway, if they do lend any money they want to see the rapid transit fares raised above the 5c limit, and then Mr. Walker landed on them. He is reported to have said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is the matter with your banks? Are you going on the rocks or are you going to stay in business ? You men come here and tell me that the credit of New York city is better than of any other municipality in the country. I want you to tell me - and tell me now—why you bankers won’t lend this city any money? You have money to lend to cities abroad; to corporations both here and abroad; to foreign countries. Just tell me why you won’t lend New York city, with the best security in the world, the money it needs as you have been doing for the past forty years. What is the reason? All right, you haven’t any obligation to this city. And when we stop feeding 30,000 widows and orphans because you won’t lend us any money, I am going to tell them that we can’t go on feeding them because the banks that have no obligation to the city have refused to lend the city any money. We will stop all these public works and improvements, the way you want us to. But when the thousands of men who are thrown out of work want to know why, I am going to tell them it is because the banks who owe no obligation to the city won’t lend the money to go on paying them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just then several of the bankers discovered that they had other pressing engagements and found it convenient to get up and go. Just what business they could have that is more important than financing the needs of the world’s greatest city in this time of need was not stated. Hope it had nothing to do with furnishing war supplies to Japan.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Wheat the Perfect Food</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">R</span><span class="font5">ECOGNIZING that unmilled whole wheat is a perfect food, containing in its bran, husk and germ all the necessary vitamins, oils, starches and proteins, Dr. Lloyd Arnold, professor of bacteriology and preventive medicine at the University of Illinois, has come out advocating the same thing we have advised in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> namely, that in these hard times there is no reason for anybody to starve when wheat can be had for so little money. Dr. Arnold has been experimenting on his own family and in his own kitchen, with the making and use of wheat soup, wheat muffins, wheat croquettes, wheat pie, wheat pudding, and whole wheat, boiled six hours, which, seasoned with salt, and served with milk and sugar, makes about the best possible breakfast food. Dr. Arnold found that in a week’s time his family consumed only four pounds of wheat, and there are sixty pounds in a bushel. The experimental bushel cost but 63 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Care of the Feet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By R. 8. Nester (Chiropodist)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">S A CHILD I spent hours at a neighboring slaughterhouse and saw pigs’ feet pickled, not realizing that a few years later I was to be a shoe clerk and an aide in putting human feet in a “pickle” by unwillingly placing on the customers’ feet shoes that fit the eyes but not the feet. My predicament of telling a lie or losing my job was a daily matter because of foolish ideas regarding the proper footgear according to the public’s idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the days of “box toe” and high top button shoes, our employer, who was a dealer of no ordinary ability and whose stock on hand was not meager, had women’s shoes in sizes from two to six, but no larger. Our first question to a female customer was, “What size shoe do you wish?” Invariably the owner of large feet would answer, “A broad size four.” Removal of the shoes disclosed the size worn to be a six, and so that size was fitted until the customer had fully decided as to their purchase, and then came that horrid question, “Is this a size four shoe?” Saying “Yes” would be a falsity. Telling the correct size would have been an insult to modesty and loss of that customer and our job as well. Our employer gave us the answer to such queries, and so our reply was, “It’s the same size you’ve been wearing.” Being the truth, but evasive of the question, would cause the order, “Wrap them up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Short and broad shoes finally went to the opposite extreme, and instead of being happy with the thought of a small foot, the pride went to the long, narrow sizes. Now the customer asks for a size eight triple A with a happy smile. The Scriptural admonition to ‘be moderate in all things’ was not heeded in regard to the feet to any greater extent than another mode of habit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later in my experience as a foot specialist, while advising my patient about proper footwear and in condemning their present size and style I was taunted with the remark, “This is exactly what you advised as a perfect shoe size when you were a shoe clerk.” All I could answer in frankness was that our stock had nothing larger to offer. Now suppose we consider the foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our foot is a wonderfully balanced structure composed of twenty-six bones, or fifty-two for the pair. To consider that our body is composed of 206 bones, and that our feet use more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">343</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">than one-fourth the total, proves that its many joints were placed so freedom of action to render service was the original purpose. Why strangle this flexibility and impair action to please the eye of style? A poorly fitted shoe compresses the flesh and joints so as to make it hardly possible for blood circulation to pass through. For this reason we often see persons seated in homes or audiences who slide the shoe partly or entirely off the foot as a timid confession of a poorly fitted shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Air or fluids when compressed create heat temperatures greater than normal. Yes, and the blood pressure in attempting to force the circulation through pinched arteries, veins and capillaries causes heat and pressure sufficient to expand the vessels. This expansion causes thinness of the conduits or channels, and the heat causes flabbiness, so as to allow seepage of the thin acid fluid content of the blood stream to the outside tissues. Because of the acid nature, the skin tissues are attacked and a deterioration results. We call this action bromi-drosis (or osmidrosis), or perspiring feet; and this is a condition which many have, but few enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pressure phase is of greater danger than the temperature, as it stretches the artery walls in such a continuous way, because this pressure is a bodily slavery of twelve or more hours daily, and when relieved the vessels do not contract to normal size again. This stretched condition takes away the smoothness of the inner lining of the vessels and then any solids or wastes which the veins would carry back to the heart for disposal collect in cavities and cause deterioration of the structures, and in this way it lays a foundation for those ailments known as varicose veins, dropsy, and hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By this time it is acknowledged that no disease can be contracted if our normal vitality is maintained. We breathe daily the bacteria of dangerous diseases, but they are dangerous only if our body is not functioning so as to keep itself clean of wastes which bacteria use as incubators and breeding-places before they attack the body and we notice the symptoms. Congestion and faulty elimination are the causes of most troubles, while the ailments to which we attach names are merely the results of our cwn abuse or neglect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, the body does have auxiliary vessels to give aid when the main ones are clogged, but they are small and are in reality merely detours; and since detours on the highway are not to our favor, why not avoid the bodily need of them ? Massage and electric vibration treatments are becoming quite popular, as they loosen this clogged and stagnant condition, thus allowing the circulation to resume its normal course of procedure. If it were not for these auxiliary “detour” vessels, a tight shoe could cause the blood to back up, flood the heart (stall the motor), and in that w<sup>r</sup>ay cause our death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A shoe, when new, should be fitted so as to be fully comfortable, since stretching is not natural but is due to the fact of being weakened to allow the extra space needed by the foot. This causes the shoe to lose its shape. It is then weakened to give poor wear, and the foot suffers while stretching the shoe and also for the balance of the wearing period. Needless to say, properly fitted footgear gives the opposite, or what we need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This ill treatment of the foot which begins with our youth, when Daddy was unable to buy us a new pair of shoes and considered repair of the old, outgrown ones as the greatest economy, has laid the foundation for misgrowth and badly shaped arches. These fallen or weakened, flabby arches and continued misfits are the causes of all foot aches and pains. Bunions, corns, callouses, ingrowing nails, etc., are results, and not causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Weakened arches allow the foot to elongate or spread to such a degree that the bodily weight is not properly distributed on the normal bearing points, and thus any part carrying more weight and strain than intended for it gives us notice at once. But fallen-arch conditions themselves are caused by the ill-fitting shoe. Here is the source of all our foot troubles, and the other subjects or phases of the footache are merely results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In youth our bone structure was lithe and easily shaped and small shoes denied the muscles and tendons their normal exercise, and so instead of strengthening, they weakened because the shoe w<sup>r</sup>as too short to allow proper development of the strength required to carry not only our then present weight, but also our now abnormal weight. If your feet have a hot, achy and tired feeling on the under surface just back of the toes, if it is a spot that reminds you of the time you stepped on a tack, if it is coated with callous, then you have one or all three stages of fallen, metatarsal arches. This will cause a tired ache in the calf of the leg and also that dreaded pain across the hips to the rear known as the kidney section. Thousands of persons under medical attention because of this pain have it diagnosed as weak kidneys or the first stages of diabetes when the actual cause is muscle strain or tension, as this is the spot where many of our leg muscles and tendons originate or have their attachment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To avoid these conditions, try having the shoe fitted so that when your weight is upon it there is sufficient space from the longest toe end to the shoe tip to allow the thumb to be placed crosswise without extending beyond the tip of the shoe. Now’ your shoe is proper in length; and so don’t strangle the foot in shoe width, and some of the troubles will flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For those already afflicted, use the above method also, and if arch supporters are needed, use those of the leather or flexible type, as they flex and rebuild the foot into position, while a metal supporter will hold the foot rigid, weaken the muscles from lack of flexing, and then you are an arch support customer for a lifetime. For this reason shoe stores recommend the metal supporter. No arch supporter shoe has anything more than a metal shank, which gives a slight support, but not the relief promised, as that is just a trade falsity. The leather supporter flexes, supports and restores by allowing natural movement of all joints in harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The longitudinal arch is formed with the heel as the rear base and the first or large toe joint as its front base. This arch is seldom normal, but causes less pain or aches than the metatarsal condition. Its notice or warning of seriousness causes severe aches deep-seated directly below the ankle joint, and if not too severe or chronic, the supporter remedies it easily. Then the friction from weakness of both arches that caused the perspiration, the misplaced weight that caused the bunion, the chafing which caused the corns and callouses, are avoided, and, naturally, the pains caused by each condition resign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When arches of either metatarsal or longitudinal or both are beyond restoration by proper shoes or arch supporters, then the chiropodist or foot specialist must be sought for correction. How can we tell if he can diagnose our case and assure us of being capable to rebuild our fallen structures ? In one way only, and here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never explain your trouble or aches to him. Allow the specialist to examine your foot, and if he can describe your pains from his diagnosis of conditions prevailing, if he suggests a course of treatment of weekly visits for three months or more, tells you that you must submit to the complete, treatment or else it won’t begin, then allow his course of treatment to start. You wonder as to the reason for stating these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each dislocation or misplacement of bone or muscle structure has its own signals or pains, and so any reliable chiropodist should be able to pronounce the. pains to you. A few w<sup>r</sup>eeks of treatment, if properly given, will relieve the pains, but the foot must be held in its corrected position for a three months’ period of treatment to allow the foot tendons and joint ligaments to adjust to the corrected positions and assume their responsibility of keeping the structure corrected. If the treatment is only for the period of pain relief, it will cause this treatment to need repetition at seasonal intervals. Spring and autumn seasons often find aching joints because of temperature variations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have considered the cause of friction and chafing, and now the results follow. Friction causes an extra supply of blood to rush to the spot 'where the chafing occurs; and as the blood is a repair chemical, it causes a repair or extra supply of skin to form at the irritated spot. This is called a “callous”. As this tissue is allowed to increase, the heaviest point or center becomes dry and hard, while the outer edges are kept moist by contact with the skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pressure causes this hard surface to force aside the soft under tissues, thus forming a cavity which does not penetrate the skin but does press on the nerve tissues so severely, causing them to register the severe pain which we call a “corn”. Now please note that the corn is not a growth, but a formation only. It has no roots, and is only thought to have them when in search of relief the razor blade hits live tissue or when the chiropodist offers his false alibi for drawing blood, “I’m getting the root out,” as his excuse for pain and blood-flow while under treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are hard and soft corns. This difference is due only to the fact that this friction and chafing occurs between the toes instead of on outside surface; the corn is kept moist by perspiration and then named “soft” corn. Had this no moisture it would be called a hard corn also, as the cause and formation are the same. The treatment is not with the razor blade, but merely to pad the surfaces around the corn, wear a broader shoe, and the corn disappears of itself. “But we don’t need broader shoes,” is the plea. Now prove this statement at once. Take off your right shoe and put it beside the foot while weight is carried on the bare foot, and now if your shoe is as broad as the foot carrying Aveight, then you are to be congratulated for pleasing the foot instead of the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hallux valgus, or bunion, is merely a condition in which the large toe was forced to taper toward the smaller toes because the shoes are all shaped to taper. This bunches the toes; and a badly fitted shoe may even cause the first or large toe to lie across the other toes. The joint must then protrude and it receives abnormal friction. Since the shoes are often too short and the foot cannot elongate, it must spread and thus subject the points to friction not supposed to be chafed. Every joint of the body contains a gland for lubricating that socket, and for that reason a person who has passed a certain age is stiff or subject to painful, cracky joints when this gland ages and fails to secrete the lubrication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the first or large toe joint the friction and pressure are so great as to chafe the skin and cause a tenderness which forces the gland to over-secrete, and since this secretion has no outlet, it must annoy because of the heat and pulsating thump that accompanies such pressures. The shoe is usually sliced at that spot to allow the space for freedom. This is a frank admission of ill-fitting shoes, and this action ■would be unnecessary if the proper space were allowed when purchasing the shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Massage with oil of wintergreen, pad with cotton to avoid friction, and wear spacious shoes, and ten days will see a stubborn case relieved of pain, but the shaping of the toe to normal is gradual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Verruca', or warts, are growths, and as the sole of the foot is subject to them, no home treatment is advised. Your chiropodist or podiatrist must be seen for relief of this condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No, we didn’t forget the ingrowing nail, as it is a very painful foot ailment. It is caused by the short shoe, and this forces the nail back into the toe, and, as the fingers and toes are the two extremes of our body, they are seats of the nerve terminals. Hence, pressure on these terminal projectors causes great pain. Now, notice the beautiful shape of the finger nails and the crushed, twisted shape of the toe nails. Then realize that abuse causes this difference, and nothing else. Why don’t we have ingrowing finger nails'? Because no nails ingrow, and are only considered as such on our feet, due to cramped toes, and since our fingers are free from the bindings we call shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If high heels are even considered as a topic of thought, I will only say in passing that the patients of a foot specialist are four female to every male in ratio because the male wears low heels and broader-tipped shoes. Freedom of foot action is the cure for all foot ailments, and not the drug stores’ promise of relief. The latter promises; the former method fulfills and avoids future, trouble.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font5">OR many years the chiropractors of Pennsylvania have been seeking at the hands of the Pennsylvania legislature the same rights to practice their art of healing as is enjoyed by members of the American Medical Association, but there are always enough adherents of the medical trust to prevent the passage of the law they desire. The medicos “protect the art of healing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiropractic is a lawful art of healing in many states, and should be lawful in every state, but the medical trust resorts to every possible means to prevent the people from having opportunity to make use of it. It now appears that for practicing this art of healing, and effecting a cure where the medical practitioner has given up the case as hopeless, it is proper to fine a man $100 or give him fifteen days in jail for saving a life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New Milford Chiropractor Is Taken Before Judge Smith of Montrose</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PAYS FINE OF $100</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Montrose—J. M. Hardy, New Milford chiropractor, violated a court parole to save the life of a child, it was developed yesterday when he was brought before Judge Andrew B. Smith for parole violation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than a year ago Hardy was found guilty of practicing in violation of the Act of 1911 which protects the art of healing, and was fined $100 and placed under parole for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last August he was called to attend the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Huntley, who reside near New Milford, but refused to give service and advised the retention of a medical man, according to the testimony in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Parents of the child, who is five years old, said they called a physician, who refused to respond because he had established a rule against night calls. Subsequently the physician visited the child and declared her to be beyond medical assistance because of a bowel obstruction due to eating green pears, according to testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The parents, fearing for the safety of their daughter, pleaded with Hardy to administer treatment, and he responded despite the parole hanging over him, it was declared in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The testimony indicated he applied [chiropractic treatments], which he characterized as “first aid.” The child recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Smith directed he pay a fine of $100 or spend 15 days in jail for violation of the parole. Hardy paid the fine.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Blessing to All Families of Earth Near</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">UXTTHEN are these good times coming that VV you speak about?” a man said to one of Jehovah’s witnesses who talked with him at the doorstep of his home. Good times! that’s what all the people cry for; that’s what each political party that wants to get elected or to remain in office promises to give the people if they will only give them their votes. But the people have surely heard that before, and how many times! Yet they never seem to learn from experience, and the merry round of politics goes on year in and year out. And here the world is at the worst period of depression ever known. Of course, the political and financial prophets assure us we have reached the bottom of the depression, that we have reached the corner and are about to round it; but they cannot make thoughtful people believe that the bright times that they promise to bring will stay permanently. Their periods of good times have always come in spasms and been short-lived, and their good times have been such only for some but not for all the families of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1929 one of the leading ecclesiastics of the world presented himself before the eye of the public and pronounced some words by which he claimed he was blessing the whole world. But strangely (or not strangely, when you think of it) his words have not, after these several years, been followed by a world blessing. If any believes the blessing has come, where is it? ‘Oh,’ says someone, ‘it’s the fault of the people!’ But, we answer, are earthquakes the people’s own fault? are floods, famines, destructive storms, wars, and this widespread unemployment the fault of the people? Are even disease, pestilence, and death the fault of the people? You cannot prove, from the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, that these things are the people’s fault, or that God is mercilessly punishing them because they are at fault; and if you cannot prove it from the Bible you cannot prove it at all, because Jesus Christ himself said that God’s Word is truth. Blessings that religious men may pronounce do not amount to a red cent if the words of blessing are not authorized by God’s Word and are not backed up by God. It is an easy matter to claim to bless the people in order to win their sympathy, favor or financial support. It is easy to pretend to bless the world out of gratitude for political favors from worldly politicians. It is easy to fend off the charge of being a false prophet by arguing that the people are at fault for not receiving the blessing. But human creatures cannot even bless themselves, much less bless the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real blessing to all families of the earth is the blessing that comes regardless of whether the people are at fault, and no one will claim that the people are perfect or not sinners or are above reproach. The blessing will come, because. God has both purposed and promised it, and His almighty power will bring it. He brings it out of sheer love for the people, and His time for it is at hand. Some will scoff and pooh-pooh the statement that God will bring a blessing to all human families. But scoffers who make the fleshly arm of man their trust must admit that it is the most hopeless and ridiculous thing to think that men, be they doctors, scientists, politicians, clergymen, labor leaders, or financiers, will bring the desired blessing to the people. And that is as regards the people living now, and not the vast multitude who have died, including your boys who marched to the colors in 1914 to 1918, and your loved ones who were smitten down with the pestilence then or since. It is the most reasonable and sensible thing, as well as the only Scriptural thing, to look to God alone to bring the all-needed blessing. Never mind that God has not brought it before now. The Bible clearly shows it was not His time before now; He had preliminary or preparatory work to do before now. There has never been any need for God to hurry up just to spare any generation of people from going down into the grave. God will bring the promised blessing to them even though they have died, because He will raise the dead from their graves and bring them back on this earth that He may fulfil His covenant to bless, not merely some, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> the families of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How’ever, when did God make such a sweeping promise, and what preparatory work has He been doing to make the promise good? It was two thousand and forty-five years before Christ that the Almighty God made the promise. Nothing that any man or group of men did induced Him to make it. As if anything that any man or family of men did could move God to promise to bless all mankind! But to whom God should first make known the promise, that was a matter to be determined by human conduct before God. It was faith toward God that decided that point, for “without faith it is impossible to please him”. (Heb. 11:6) That grand old man, Abraham,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">had such faith and also works in harmony with such faith. God originated His purpose within the counsels of His own mind and at the prompting of His own love. He observed the pleasing faith of Abraham and put it to a test, saying to Abraham while he was still in his own homeland : “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: . . . and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 12:1-3) Abraham demonstrated his faith by promptly moving out with all his household. Under God’s guidance he. came into the land God promised to show him. Then first was it made certain, not that the promise to bless mankind would come true, but that Abraham should be the human instrument whom God would use in connection with bestowing the blessing. Abraham, however, was not to be the blesser (he is dead now for thousands of years and hence of himself can do nothing for mankind), but he was, in this connection, merely a human picture of Jehovah God the actual Blesser. Abraham’s original name, Abram, means “lofty father”, which name applies to the. great God who shall shortly reconcile all mankind to Him as His children and for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s promise to bless has seemed to man always to hang on a very slender thread that would surely snap sometime; but that our faith in its unchangeableness might be made strong, God later on gave His oath and swore to it, saying: “By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, . . . that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.” (Gen. 22: 16-18) That sworn statement was made at the time that Abraham’s only son by his true wife Sarah was lying on the altar ready to be sacrificed. To test the degree to which Abraham’s faith would go, God had commanded him to take this son and offer him as a human sacrifice upon Mount Moriah. Abraham obeyed and was about to slay Isaac, when God’s angel halted the proceeding and announced God’s approval and His glorious purpose to Abraham and his son and toward all earthly nations. Here God showed that it would be through Abraham’s seed or offspring that the blessing would come. By having</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham’s son presented for human sacrifice before making this statement of blessing, God showed that this seed of Abraham must die sacrificially for all nations who were to be blessed through him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that Abraham’s son was not permitted to be slain, but was restored to his father and a ram was offered instead, showed that this particular seed of Abraham, though slain sacrificially, would be raised from the dead by God's power of resurrection, that thus the resurrected “seed” might be alive to serve as the agent to fulfil God’s promise toward all nations. This is what the Apostle Paul means when he writes: “By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, . . . accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.” (Heb. 11: 17-19) God repeated His promise to Isaac after he had married Rebecca (Gen. 26:1-5); He reiterated it to Isaac’s son Jacob, after Jacob had bought the birthright. (Gen. 28:10-14) Since then almost four thousand years have elapsed, and men today feel and know that up till now mankind’s blessing has not come. But it must come and will come, otherwise the word and oath of the Bible’s God, who is Jehovah, would be proved unreliable; and angels and also the families and nations of the earth would always have something that they could flaunt in the face of God. God will never let such a thing happen; already He has been almost overly forbearing with men and has permitted infidels, atheists, agnostics, and even professed Christians to fling many serious charges in His face, but He has done so because He has always been biding His fixed time. He says: “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass.” (Isa. 46:11) His oath-clad promise is the only hope for the people today in their extreme necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries it was a mystery who should be the seed to bring the blessing. It is manifest that the nations and families could not receive the promised good until the seed should be brought forth. The Jews, the fleshly seed of Abraham, made their two thousand years of painful history and as a nation failed to prove themselves the true seed. Finally, Peter, the fisherman of Galilee, speaking by inspiration of the spirit of God, began to clear up the mystery when he addressed a crowd of Jews in the temple at Jerusalem, and said, “Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” (Acts 3:25, 26) Jesus Christ is thus by inspiration declared and proved to be the seed of Abraham in whom all earthly nations must be blessed. It now becomes clear that Abraham’s offering up his son Isaac on the altar is a prophetic picture of how God would offer, and did offer up, His only-begotten Son Jesus as a human sacrifice, in order that all families and nations of earth might be blessed with God's forgiveness of their sins and with full cleansing from sin and its deadly effects. Abraham’s receiving back his son who had been devoted to a sacrificial death prophetically pictured how God would receive back His beloved Son Jesus from the dead by resurrecting Him from the hellish grave on the third day. He did this that Jesus might live to reign as King over mankind when God’s due time for the Kingdom should come. (Rom. 14:9) The Apostle Paul also tells us that the fact that Jesus was raised from the dead is a proof and guarantee that at God's fixed time all the human dead should be raised from their graves and broken family ties be bound up again. (1 Cor. 15: 20) This is in full accord with Jesus’ own words, saying: “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.” (John 5: 28, 29) All this, of course, suggests some of the blessings that are due to come to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nineteen hundred years ago it was that Jesus died and was raised again and returned to heaven. Since He is the true seed of Abraham, why has God not made good His promise to all nations ere now? Why has not the blessing already begun? The answer is that it has already begun. The words of the Apostle Peter, previously quoted, declared that the blessing had begun back there in Peter’s day; it had begun both upon Peter and his fellow apostles and upon all who had then become genuine Christians. They had received the blessing of the forgiveness of their sins, by faith; they had been adopted into God’s family as His children, and were fully reconciled to Him. They were now in line for the prize of immortal life in heaven and a place in the work of God’s kingdom, if faithful unto death. All who have during this Christian era accepted Christ Jesus as the Savior whom Jehovah God sent, and who have taken up the cross to follow His steps, have likewise received of God’s goodness through Jesus, the promised seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, you ask, are true Christians the only ones who are. to be blessed in Jesus the seed? No; for John’s first epistle, chapter two, verse two, says: “And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” Christians are those whom God, during this Christian era, has taken out from the nations to be associated with Jesus in His heavenly kingdom; whereas God’s ancient promise to Abraham stated that in his seed not merely Christians, the true church of Christ, but “all nations” should be blessed. Real Christians do not make up “all nations”. There are hundreds of millions of imitation Christians today, that is, those who name themselves as Christian but who do not anywhere nearly follow Jesus’ teaching, and there are whole nations whom religious leaders call Christian, but Jesus numbered His followers as merely a “little flock”. (Luke 12:32) Hence “all nations”, including these hundreds of millions of so-called Christians, must yet be blessed in the true and actual sense; also all those families of men who lived and died before Jesus’ death and resurrection, and who had therefore no chance to become Christians, must likewise yet be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul helps us to understand why God’s loving-kindness to all nations has not yet come through the promised seed. In his writings he points out a hitherto great mystery, namely, that the true seed of Abraham is not merely one individual, not Jesus alone, but includes also His true disciples who are faithful unto death. Jesus is, of course, the main one, the chief and all-necessary one of the seed; He is the Head of it, and the other members are, as it were, the body of the seed. If it were not for Jesus the Head, and what God did through Him, the other members of the seed could not be part in it or share with Jesus in blessing men. Take note, then, what the apostle writes in Galatians three, verses seven to nine, sixteen, and twenty-nine: “Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before [hand] the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed [now] with faithful Abraham. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made; He saith not, And to seeds, as of many [seeds]; but as of one [seed], And to thy seed, which is Christ. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus during the past nineteen centuries of intense, human suffering the blessing of the nations has seemed to delay because God has been calling, electing (or choosing) and testing and preparing the other members of “the seed of Abraham”. (Isa. 41:8) “Many are called, but few are chosen.” Revelation (7: 4; 14:1) shows that just one hundred and forty-four thousand will finally be chosen to be crowned and to sit with Jesus in His heavenly throne and to reign with Him over earth for the eternal good of all human families, living or dead. Nineteen centuries appear to be a long time for God to be taking out one hundred forty-four thousand from the nations of earth, but God has not permitted himself to be deceived by the billions of persons claimed to be converted to Christianity; He has been carefully searching for and picking out the genuine brand of Christians, those conformed to the image of His dear Son Jesus. These first must be blessed before earthly blessings can go to the rest of our race. These must die in their faithfulness, and God must raise them to divine life in heaven with Christ Jesus, that they might live and reign with Him and be used of God to make good His promise in behalf of all nations. Thus the seed of Abraham will be completed, and in this completed seed all families of mankind may be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">World events and conditions since 1914 prove to be the fulfilments of the prophecies of Jesus and of all the prophets, showing that the judicially determined end of the wicked world organization fell due in 1914. The time had there come for Jesus to begin His invisible rulership of earth and to dash the nations, that is, their systems, to pieces, and to destroy for ever the invisible and earthly parts of the organization of that mighty one in whom all families and nations of the earth have been cursed, namely, Satan, the Devil, “that old serpent.” The seed of the Serpent, that is, those whom Jesus classed as being ‘of their father the devil’ (John 8:44), have likewise been a curse to manldnd. These, in spite of the sufferings of mankind due to inherited sinfulness and its train of imperfections, weaknesses, sicknesses and death, these, let it be repeated, have devilishly laid more suffering, trouble and woe upon the people by oppressing them, robbing them, misteaching them, compelling them to engage in sanguinary wars, deceiving them, keeping God’s truth from them, and, in a word, misruling them. These shall be destroyed with Satan in the battle of Armageddon now preparing. Were Satan and his seed who operate his wicked organization in heaven and earth permitted to go on controlling men’s affairs, they would try to hinder indefinitely the blessing which is due to come to all nations and which, for man’s sake, must come soon, yes, right soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same conditions and events since 1914 prove that the last members of the seed of Abraham are on earth and their transference to God’s service in heaven with Jesus is near. This, of course, augurs good in the. immediate future for the peoples of the nations, living and dead. The Scriptures speak of Jesus as the Head of that Abrahamic seed, and of His fellow members as being the body of the seed, or “the body of Christ”. Consistent with these figures of speech, the last members of the seed who are yet on earth are Scripturally spoken of as being “the feet of him”. These are the ones today who follow the example of the Apostle Paul, who said that both “publicly, and from house to house”, he went teaching God’s message. (Acts 20: 20, 21) These symbolic “feet” are the little band of men and women who believe in true Christianity and who on Sundays as well as week days call at your doors and introduce to you the subject of God’s kingdom and offer you books telling about this glorious and much-needed blessing that is at hand for your family and all families through God's kingdom which is now invisibly taking control over earth. Up and down the mountainlike kingdoms and governments of the world go these men and women, like symbolic “feet” of Christ’s body. Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter fifty-two, verses seven and eight, foretold their coming to your doors and described their message to you, by prophesying: “How beautiful upon the. mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion [that is, unto God’s kingdom class], Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion [God’s kingdom].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blessing of all the families of our race in Abraham’s seed means the removal of the curse that came upon Adam and Eve for their transgression in Eden that has resulted in evil and suffering and death to all their offspring. The coming blessing means reconciliation to God through Christ the seed. It means the true knowledge of God, relief from oppression, good times for ever, the recovery of perfect health, restoration to God’s image and likeness in perfection, eternal life on earth, freedom from all evils and disasters, and a paradise home on earth with all your loved ones restored to you from the graves. It means the vindication of God's word of promise and the highest exaltation of His unimpeachable name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take, then, your Bible and study with the unsectarian Bible helps now available for all, and see and prove to your own complete satisfaction that this blessing of all the families of the earth is near!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">B</span><span class="font5">EGINNING March 20 one of the greatest witnesses, we feel sure, will he given to the nations of earth concerning God’s purposes. The reason we make this positive statement is that all true Christians throughout the earth will be making a special effort to carry to the people in every land the good news of God’s kingdom. Jesus prophesied that this Kingdom message would be preached in all the world as a witness and then the end should come, the end of this wicked oppressive organization that is ruled by the Devil. Arrangements have been made for intense activity on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses so that during this period a greater number of people will be called on than ever before. It is anticipated that two million (2,000,000) people all over the world will be spoken to by Jehovah’s witnesses on the subject of the Kingdom. Books and booklets in as many as fifty-two languages will be available so that practically everyone who reads at all will be able to avail himself of the opportunity to obtain books and booklets that will fully explain the nature and purpose of the kingdom of God, and to prove to themselves that this Kingdom is soon to take full control of earth’s affairs.</span></p>

We feel sure, however, that the majority of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> readers have given these books an important place in their libraries and that many of them would like to distribute Judge Rutherford’s books amongst their friends, and we invite them to do so. All who would like to have a part in distributing the message of the Kingdom, which Kingdom is the only hope of the world, can obtain books and booklets from this organization and distribute them amongst their neighbors, friends and relatives, so that they too may be enlightened regarding the importance of the time in which we are living. An excellent time to do this would be during International Thanksgiving Testimony Period. Use the coupon below in placing your order for literature you desire to use from March 20 to 27.</span></p>

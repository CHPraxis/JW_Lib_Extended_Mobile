BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Is a world without poverty possible?






How will God bring about a world without poverty?—Matthew 6:9, 10.





Extreme poverty kills millions every year through malnutrition and disease. Although parts of the world are prosperous, a large portion of mankind still live in extreme poverty. The Bible indicates that poverty has been an ongoing problem among humans.—Read John 12:8.
It would take a world government to end poverty. Such a government would have to have the power both to distribute the world’s resources fairly and to end wars, which are a major cause of poverty. God has promised such a world government.—Read Daniel 2:44.



Who can eliminate poverty?

God has appointed his Son, Jesus, to rule over all mankind. (Psalm 2:4-8) Jesus will rescue the poor and bring an end to oppression and violence.—Read Psalm 72:8, 12-14.
As the foretold “Prince of Peace,” Jesus will establish world peace and security. Then all on earth will live in their own home, enjoy satisfying work, and have plenty to eat.—Read Isaiah 9:6, 7; 65:21-23.

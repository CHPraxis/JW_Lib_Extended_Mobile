<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Friends communicate with each other to cultivate a good relationship. Likewise, God invites us to talk to him, opening the way for a warm friendship. He says: “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:29:12-24:29:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:12</a>) As you speak to God, you will “draw close to [him], and he will draw close to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) The Bible assures us: “Jehovah is near to all those calling on him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:18-19:145:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 145:18</a>) The more we pray to him, the more our friendship with God will flourish.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus said: “Which one of you, if his son asks for bread, will hand him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not hand him a serpent, will he? Therefore, if you . . . know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:9-40:7:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:9-11</a>) Yes, God invites you to pray because “he cares for you” and wants to help you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>) He even invites you to go to him with your problems. The Bible tells us: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Experts on human nature have observed that hundreds of millions of people feel a need to pray. Even some atheists and agnostics are included in this number.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> This attests to the fact that humans were created with a spiritual need. Jesus said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) One way we can fill that need is by regularly communicating with God.</p>

Field Service Highlights




When comparing this January with the same month last year, there were increases in return visits of 8.7 percent in Bermuda, 4.7 percent in Jamaica, and 6.8 percent in the United States. These figures show that there is still much work to be done in helping others ‘come to know’ Jehovah.—John 17:3.

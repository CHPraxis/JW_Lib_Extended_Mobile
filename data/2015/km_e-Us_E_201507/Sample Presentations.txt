The Watchtower August 1

“We’re visiting briefly to help our neighbors cope with a common problem. One of the most difficult things we have to deal with is the death of a loved one. Wouldn’t you agree? [Allow for response.] Notice this encouraging promise from the Bible. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] The Bible gives us hope that one day our dead loved ones will come back to life. This magazine explains how this will happen.”



Awake! August

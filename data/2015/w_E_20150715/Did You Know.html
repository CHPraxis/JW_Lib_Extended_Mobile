<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">THE Bible states that certain areas of the Promised Land were forested and that trees were “plentiful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:10:27-11:10:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:17:15-6:17:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Josh. 17:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:17:18-6:17:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 18</a>) Yet, on seeing the deforested condition of large portions of the land today, skeptics may wonder if that could ever have been the case.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The book <em>Life in Biblical Israel </em>explains that “forests in ancient Israel were much more extensive than they are today.” The natural cover of the highlands consisted mainly of Aleppo pine (<em>Pinus halepensis</em>), evergreen oak (<em>Quercus calliprinos</em>), and terebinth (<em>Pistacia palaestina</em>). In the Shephelah, an area that includes the foothills between the central mountain range and the Mediterranean Coast, the sycamore fig (<em>Ficus sycomorus</em>) was also abundant.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book <em>Plants of the Bible </em>states that some localities in Israel are now entirely devoid of trees. What contributed to this? Explaining that it was a gradual process, the book says: “Man has persistently interfered with the natural vegetation, mainly in order to expand his farming and pasture area, but also to obtain building materials and fuel for his fire.”</p>

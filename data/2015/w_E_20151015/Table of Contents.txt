STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Do You See God’s Hand in Your Life?
▪  “Give Us More Faith”
In the first article, we learn how to perceive God’s interest and his hand in our life and how to avoid the mistakes of those who fail to do so. The second article discusses the importance of faith for salvation and how we can strengthen our faith and put it into action.—Heb. 11:6.

▪  Serve Jehovah Without Distraction
▪  Keep Meditating on Spiritual Things
We live in what has been called the age of distraction. What can we do to avoid needless distractions so that we can keep focusing our attention on the spiritual side of our life? To that end, as we read God’s Word, how can we make sure that our study is productive? These articles will explain.

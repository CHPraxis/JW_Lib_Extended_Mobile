<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">WHEN we become Christians, it is as if we begin a journey. If we remain faithful to God, our journey will be a success and we can live forever. Jesus said: “The one who has endured to the end will be saved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:13</a>) Yes, to finish our journey, we must remain faithful to God until “the end,” whether it is the end of our life or the end of this wicked world. But we must be careful not to get distracted by this world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) How can we stay focused on our journey?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Courage is a feeling that can strengthen us and help us to endure difficulties. Courage also helps us to defend what is right. It can help us to remain calm and faithful to God when we suffer trials. Courage is related to fear, hope, and love. How? When we have a <strong>fear </strong>of displeasing God, we will not let fear of man affect us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:11:7-9:11:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 11:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Proverbs 29:25</a>) <strong>Hope </strong>in Jehovah helps us to focus on our future and not on our trials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:14-19:27:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 27:14</a>) Unselfish <strong>love </strong>motivates us to show courage even when we are persecuted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>) We get courage by trusting in God and imitating his Son.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:28:7-19:28:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 28:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did Jesus show courage in the temple? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>At 12 years of age, Jesus showed courage when he was “in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:41-42:2:47" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 2:41-47</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Those religious teachers knew the Mosaic Law very well, but they also knew the Jewish traditions. These traditions made the Law difficult to obey. But Jesus did not allow their knowledge to stop him from speaking up. He was not afraid. He kept “asking them questions.” Of course, Jesus was not asking questions that a young boy would usually ask. Instead, we can imagine him asking deep questions that made those teachers pay attention and think. And if the teachers tried to trick Jesus with questions that would cause arguments, they failed. All those listening, including the teachers, were amazed “at his understanding and his answers.” Yes, Jesus courageously defended the truth that is found in God’s Word!</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>In what ways did Jesus show courage during his ministry?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>During his ministry, Jesus showed courage in different ways. For example, he showed the people that the religious leaders were misleading them with their false teachings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:13-40:23:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 23:13-36</a>) Also, Jesus did not allow the world to corrupt him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:33-43:16:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 16:33</a>) He kept preaching despite opposition.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Let us examine Jesus’ courage on the final day of his life on earth. Jesus knew what would happen once Judas betrayed him. Yet, at the Passover meal, Jesus told Judas: “What <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>you are doing, do it more quickly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:21-43:13:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 13:21-27</a>) Then, in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus courageously identified himself to the soldiers who came to arrest him. Even though his own life was in danger, he protected his disciples, telling the soldiers: “Let these men go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:1-43:18:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 18:1-8</a>) Later, when the Jewish high court questioned him, Jesus courageously told them that he was the Christ and the Son of God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:60-41:14:65" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Mark 14:60-65</a>) Jesus kept his integrity to God and died on the torture stake.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Discernment is the ability to understand the difference between right and wrong and then to choose to do what is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) A discerning Christian makes decisions that will strengthen his relationship with God.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jesus showed discernment in all that he said and did. <strong>In his speech. </strong>When he preached the good news, Jesus used kind words that amazed his listeners.

After his resurrection, Jesus spoke to two disciples on their way to Emmaus. He explained the meaning of the scriptures that applied to himself.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>In his emotions and attitude. </strong>Discernment helped Jesus to be “slow to anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a>) He was able to control his emotions, and he was “mild-tempered.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:29-40:11:29" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 11:29</a>) Jesus was always patient with his disciples despite their faults.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:23-40:23:23" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew 23:23</a>) Jesus kindly said: “Daughter, your faith has made you well.

We do not expect our brothers and sisters to be perfect. Instead, we remember that they may have problems that we do not fully understand. We are willing to listen to their opinions. And when we can, we yield, which means that we do not insist on our own way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Philippians 4:5</a>.</p>

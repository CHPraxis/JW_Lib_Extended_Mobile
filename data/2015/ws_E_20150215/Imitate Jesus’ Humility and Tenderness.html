<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">WE USUALLY try to imitate the people we admire. Of all the humans who have ever lived, Jesus Christ is the best person to imitate. Why? Jesus once said: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) This is because Jesus imitates his Father’s personality perfectly. So when we learn about Jesus, we learn about Jehovah. And when we imitate Jesus, we draw closer to Jehovah, the greatest Person in the universe. What a great honor!</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>2, 3. </strong>(a) Why did Jehovah give us a detailed description of Jesus’ life, and what does our God expect us to do? (b) What will we discuss in this article and in the next?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the Bible, Jehovah has given us a detailed description of Jesus’ life. Why? Because our God wants us to know his Son so that we can imitate him closely. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 2:21</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In the Bible, the example Jesus left for us is compared to footsteps. What does that mean? <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jehovah wants us to follow in his Son’s footsteps, that is, to imitate Jesus in everything he did. Of course, Jesus was perfect, so Jehovah does not expect us to imitate his Son perfectly. Instead, God wants us to do our very best to imitate Jesus.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Let us examine some of Jesus’ beautiful qualities. In this article, we will discuss his humility and tenderness. In the next, we will discuss his courage and discernment. We will answer three questions about each quality: What does it mean? How did Jesus show this quality? How can we imitate him?</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>What is humility? Many people who are proud think that humility is a sign of weakness or a lack of confidence. But is that true? Actually, to be humble, we need to be strong and courageous. Humility is the opposite of pride and arrogance. In the Bible, the word “humility” can be translated as “lowliness of mind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3</a>, footnote) To be humble, we first need to have the right attitude about ourselves. For example, one Bible dictionary says: “Humility is to know how lowly we really are before God.” Also, if we are humble, we will not feel that we are better than other people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 12:3</a>) It is not easy for imperfect humans to show this quality. But we can learn to be humble if we meditate on Jehovah’s greatness and imitate Jesus’ example.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did Jesus show humility? God’s Son has always been humble, both as a powerful angel in heaven and as a perfect man on earth. Let us see a few examples.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup>His attitude. </strong>In the Bible book of Jude, we read about Jesus’ life before he came to the earth. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Jude 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As Michael the archangel, that is, the chief angel, Jesus “had a difference with the Devil” and “was disputing” with that wicked one “about Moses’ body.” After Moses died, Jehovah buried his body in a place where no human would find it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:34:5-5:34:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 34:5, 6</a>) Perhaps the Devil wanted to tempt the Israelites to use Moses’ body for false worship. Whatever evil the Devil wanted to do, Michael courageously stopped him. One reference book says that the words “had a difference” and “disputing” are also used to describe “a legal dispute” and may suggest that “Michael ‘challenged the Devil’s right’ to take Moses’ body.” Yet, the archangel knew that his authority was limited. So he referred the case to Jehovah, the Supreme Judge, the only one who had the right to judge <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Satan. What a humble attitude Jesus showed!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Jesus was on earth, he also showed humility by the way he spoke and by the things he did. <strong>His speech. </strong>Jesus never wanted unnecessary attention from others.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 8:20</a>) He was willing to do humble work that others were not willing to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:3-43:13:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 13:3-15</a>) He also set a perfect example of humility by his obedience. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:5-50:2:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:5-8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Unlike proud people who hate to obey others, Jesus humbly did everything that Jehovah told him to do, even “to the point of death.” It is clear that Jesus, the Son of man, was “lowly in heart.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:29-40:11:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 11:29</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What is tenderness? The word “tender” describes gentle and caring emotions. Tenderness is an expression of love and is similar to emotions such as compassion and mercy. The Bible refers to “tender compassion,” “tender mercies,” and “tender affection.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:78-42:1:78" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 1:78;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:8-50:1:8" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Philippians 1:8</a>) One Bible reference says that showing tenderness is more than just feeling sorry for those in need. It says that having tender feelings means that we “care enough to become involved and to help” by doing something that will change other people’s lives for the better. Tenderness is a quality that motivates a person to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What shows that Jesus felt tender compassion for others, and what did his tenderness motivate him to do?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How did Jesus show tenderness? His <strong>tender feelings and actions. </strong>Jesus felt tender compassion for others. When he saw his friend Mary and others crying because Lazarus had died, Jesus cried with them. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:11:32-43:11:35" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:32-35</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Then, the same compassion that made him want to resurrect a widow’s son motivated him to resurrect Lazarus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:7:11-42:7:15" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 7:11-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> John 11:38-44</a>) This tender act may have given Lazarus the opportunity to receive life in heaven. Earlier, Jesus “felt tender affection” for a crowd that came to him. His tender compassion motivated him “to teach them many things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mark 6:34</a>; <em>Kingdom Interlinear</em>) This experience changed the lives of those who followed his teachings! Jesus’ tenderness was more than just a feeling. His tenderness also motivated him to help people in need.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:15:32-40:15:38" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 15:32-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:29-40:20:34" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 20:29-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:40-41:1:42" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Mark 1:40-42</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>His tender words. </strong>Jesus’ compassion motivated him to speak tenderly to others, especially to the oppressed. The apostle Matthew quoted Isaiah’s words about Jesus. Isaiah said: “No crushed reed will he break, and no smoldering wick will <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>he extinguish.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:3-23:42:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:20-40:12:20" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Matthew 12:20</a>) What does that mean? Jesus did not abuse or mistreat people. Instead, he spoke in a way that refreshed them. He preached a message of hope to “the brokenhearted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:61:1-23:61:1" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:1</a>) He invited people who were “toiling and loaded down” to come to him so that they could “find refreshment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30</a>) He promised his disciples that God had tender concern for each of His worshippers, including the “little ones,” or those whom the world saw as unimportant.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:18:12-40:18:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 18:12-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:6-42:12:7" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Luke 12:6, 7</a>.</p>

They need a friend who is interested in them and who listens to them. One sister who felt comforted by the brothers and sisters after her daughter died says, “I appreciated it when friends came over and just cried with me.” We can also show tenderness <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>by doing practical things to help others. Perhaps there is a widow who needs help with repairs on her home. Or maybe there is an older Christian who needs help getting to the meetings, out in the ministry, or to the doctor. Even a small act of kindness can make a big difference in a person’s life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 John 3:17, 18</a>) Most important, we can show tenderness to others by doing as much as we can to preach the good news.

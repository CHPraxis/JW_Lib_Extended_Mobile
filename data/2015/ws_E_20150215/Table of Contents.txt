▪  Imitate Jesus’ Humility and Tenderness
▪  Imitate Jesus’ Courage and Discernment
The Bible encourages us to follow Jesus’ example closely. (1 Peter 2:21) As imperfect humans, can we really follow the perfect example of Jesus? The first of these two articles discusses how we can imitate his humility and tenderness. The second article shows how we can imitate his courage and discernment.

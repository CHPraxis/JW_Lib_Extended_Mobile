<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Have you ever wondered if there is more to life than just playing, working, marrying, raising a family, and growing old? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:1-18:14:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1, 2</a>) The Bible shows that even very wise people have wondered about this.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:11-21:2:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 2:11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Does life have some meaning? First, we have to ask, How did life begin? After considering the remarkable design of our brain and the rest of our body, many have concluded that a wise Creator is behind it all. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 139:14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If so, then he must have made us for a reason! Learning that reason can add great meaning to our life.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God blessed the first human pair and gave them a thrilling assignment. His purpose was for them to fill the earth, make it a paradise, and live forever.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 1:28,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <strong>31</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God’s purpose was delayed when humans rebelled against his rule. But God did not give up on us<wbr />—or his purpose. The Bible assures us that God has been working to save faithful people and that his purpose concerning the earth will be fulfilled! So God wants you to see life the way he meant it to be! <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:29</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>From the Bible, learn how you personally can fit into God’s purpose.</p>

Conclusion




A FULL consideration of the religious beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses does not come within the scope of this brochure. Instead, we have endeavored to explain some of the principles the Witnesses believe in and to show clearly the type of family influences affecting your student if one or both parents are Witnesses.
Jehovah’s Witnesses place great emphasis on their children’s spiritual development. And they feel confident that this enhances their children’s development in other areas. The beliefs they embrace and the principles they follow give their lives meaning and help them to deal with their everyday problems. In addition, those beliefs and principles should move them to try to be eager students and good citizens throughout life.
The Witnesses endeavor to be realistic about life, so they attach great importance to education. It is, therefore, their wish to work along with you to the best of their abilities. For their part, in their homes and in their places of worship around the world, they will continue to encourage their children to play their part in this fruitful collaboration.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Christ—The Power of God
▪  He Loved People
These articles about Jesus’ miracles teach us practical lessons about showing generosity and giving support to others, and they reveal fascinating aspects of Jesus’ personality. The articles point to a time in the near future when we will see spectacular miracles take place earth wide.

▪  We Can Remain Chaste
In the current moral climate, remaining chaste can be a challenge. This article shows how our relationship with Jehovah, the counsel in his Word, and the support of mature fellow Christians can help us to resist unclean thoughts and uphold Jehovah’s high moral standards.

▪  Live in Harmony With the Model Prayer—Part I
▪  Live in Harmony With the Model Prayer—Part II
Christians do not repeat Jesus’ model prayer daily, but the requests expressed in it have meaning for all of us. These articles show how we can live in harmony with such requests.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IF YOU were a Christian in Rome in the first century, you would have been living at a dangerous time. The Christians were being cruelly persecuted by the Romans. The Romans blamed them for starting a large fire in Rome and accused them of hating people. Many of your Christian brothers and sisters were being arrested. Some were torn to pieces by animals. Others were nailed to poles and then burned alive to light up the night sky. Each day you knew that any one of these things might happen to you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>During this very difficult time, the apostle Paul was put in prison. He may have wondered whether his Christian brothers would help him, because he remembered an earlier situation when nobody did. But Paul had received help from Jehovah through the Lord Jesus. He wrote: “The Lord stood near me and infused power into me.” Jesus gave Paul the power that he needed. <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Paul even wrote that he “was rescued from the lion’s mouth.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:16-55:4:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:16, 17</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Paul remembered how Jehovah had helped him in the past. So he was convinced that Jehovah would give him the strength he needed to endure the situation he was in now as well as any future trials. He was so sure of this that he wrote: “The Lord will rescue me from <strong>every </strong>wicked work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:18-55:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:18</a>) Paul had learned that even in situations in which his brothers were not able to help him, he could always trust in Jehovah and Jesus for help. There was no doubt in his mind.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Have you ever had a difficult problem and felt alone, with no one to help you? Maybe you lost your job or had pressures at school. Maybe you were very sick or had some other difficult trial. You may have asked other people for help but were disappointed because they did not give you the help you needed. Of course, some problems are impossible for humans to solve. What will you do then? The Bible tells us to “trust in Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) But can you be sure that he will help you? Yes! We can read about many examples in the Bible that convince us that Jehovah really does help his people.</p>

But doing this is not always easy. Why? One reason is that Jehovah may not answer your prayer right away.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:13:1-19:13:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:74:10-19:74:10" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 74:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:89:46-19:89:46" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 89:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:90:13-19:90:13" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 90:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:2-35:1:2" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Habakkuk 1:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why does Jehovah not always answer our prayers right away?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Why does Jehovah not always answer our prayers right away? The Bible <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>says that Jehovah is our Father and we are his children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:13-19:103:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 103:13</a>) A human father does not give his child everything he asks for or give it to him right away. A father knows that a child might suddenly want something and then not want it anymore. A father also knows what is best for his child, and he knows how it might affect others. He knows what the child needs and when he should get it. If the father gave the child everything he asked for right away, the father would become the child’s servant. Jehovah, our Father in heaven, loves us. As our wise Creator, he knows what we need and he decides when is the best time to give us what we ask for. It is good for us to wait and see how Jehovah answers our prayers.<wbr />—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:29:16-23:29:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 29:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:9-23:45:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 45:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What does Jehovah promise about what we are able to endure?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Remember, too, that Jehovah knows what each person can and cannot endure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a>) So he gives us the strength we need. It is true that sometimes we may feel that we cannot go on anymore. But Jehovah promises that if the trial becomes too much for us to endure, he will “make the way out.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>It is comforting to know that we can trust that Jehovah knows just how much we are able to endure.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What should we do if we pray for help from Jehovah but he does not answer us right away?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>If we pray for help from Jehovah but he does not answer us right away, let us be patient. Remember that Jehovah is eager to help us, but he waits patiently for the best time to give us what we need. The Bible tells us: “Jehovah is waiting patiently to show you favor, and he will rise up to show you mercy. For Jehovah is a God of justice. Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:30:18-23:30:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:18</a>.</p>

And then, a few months later, her brother’s wife died. When Rhonda started to recover from the shock of these events, she began regular pioneering. But then her mother died. How was Rhonda able to endure these tragedies? She says: “I communicated with Jehovah every day, even with regard to small decisions. Doing so made Jehovah real to me. It taught me to rely on him rather than on myself or even on other people. And the help he gave me was real<wbr />—all my needs were cared for. As a result, I have experienced working hand in hand with Jehovah.”</p>

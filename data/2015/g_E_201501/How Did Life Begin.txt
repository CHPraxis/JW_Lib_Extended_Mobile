How Did Life Begin?

How would you complete the following sentence?
LIFE IS THE RESULT OF ․․․․․.
            EVOLUTION

            CREATION






SOME might assume that a scientifically-minded person would pick “evolution” and that a religious person would pick “creation.”
But not always.
The fact is, many educated people—including a number of scientists—question the validity of the theory.
Consider Gerard, a professor of entomology who was taught evolution at college. “When I took tests,” he says, “I would give the professors the answers they wanted—but I did not believe it.”
Why is it that even some scientifically-minded people have trouble accepting evolution as the origin of life? To answer that, consider two questions that baffle many researchers: (1) How did life get its start? and (2) How did living things develop?

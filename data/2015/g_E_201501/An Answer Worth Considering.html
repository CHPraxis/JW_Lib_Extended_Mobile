<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">AFTER considering the evidence, many people conclude that life is the product of a superior intelligence. Consider the example of Antony Flew, a professor of philosophy who at one time was a leading advocate of atheism. When he learned about the staggering complexity of life and the physical laws of the universe, Flew changed his opinion. Citing an ancient approach to reasoning, he wrote: “We must follow the argument wherever it leads.” For Professor Flew, the evidence pointed to the existence of a Creator.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Gerard, mentioned earlier in this series of articles, came to a similar conclusion. Despite his advanced education and his career in entomology, he said: “I saw no proof that life arose spontaneously from nonliving matter. The order and complexity of living things convinced me that there has to be an Organizer and Designer.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just as a person can learn about an artist by examining his artwork, Gerard came to discern the Creator’s qualities by studying the natural world. Gerard also took time to consider a book attributed to the Creator<wbr />—the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) There he found satisfying answers to questions about mankind’s past and practical solutions to the problems facing people today. He thus became convinced that the Bible was also the product of a superior mind.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As Gerard found, the Bible’s answers are worth considering. We encourage you to examine them for yourself.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc"><strong>THE BIBLE IS NOT ANTISCIENCE. </strong>On the contrary, it <em>encourages </em>people to examine the natural world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>) While the Bible is not a science textbook, it is consistent with scientific fact. For example, the Bible does not support creationism. It does not state that the earth was created in six literal 24-hour days. The term “day” as used in Genesis applies to periods of considerable length.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

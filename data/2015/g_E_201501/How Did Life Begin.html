<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But not always.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The fact is, many educated people<wbr />—including a number of scientists<wbr />—question the validity of the theory.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Consider Gerard, a professor of entomology who was taught evolution at college. “When I took tests,” he says, “I would give the professors the answers they wanted<wbr />—but I did not believe it.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Why is it that even some scientifically-minded people have trouble accepting evolution as the origin of life? To answer that, consider two questions that baffle many researchers: (1) How did life get its start? and (2) How did living things develop?</p>

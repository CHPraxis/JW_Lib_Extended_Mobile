<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">THE apostle John encouraged us to think deeply about Jehovah’s great love for us. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:1-62:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 3:1</a>, we read: “See what sort of love the Father has given us!” When we meditate on how much Jehovah loves us and how he shows his love for us, we draw closer to him and we love him even more.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Why is it difficult for some to understand that God loves them?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Sadly, some do not understand how God can love them. They think that God does not care about people. They might believe that God only makes rules and punishes those who do not obey him. Because of false teachings, some even think that God is cruel and that it is impossible to love him. Others feel that God loves all people no matter what they do. But your study of the Bible has helped you to come to know the truth about <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Jehovah. You know that love is his greatest quality and that he gave his Son as a ransom for you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>) Yet, because of your experiences in life, it may be difficult for you to understand how much Jehovah loves you.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What will help us understand Jehovah’s love for us?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>To help us understand Jehovah’s love for us, we first need to understand that Jehovah is the one who made us. He gave us life. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:100:3-19:100:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 100:3-5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>That is why the Bible describes the first human as a “son of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>) And Jesus taught us to call Jehovah “our Father in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) So Jehovah is our Father, and he loves us the way a good father loves his children.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>(a) What kind of Father is Jehovah? (b) What will we discuss in this article and in the next?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>It is hard for some to think of a father as a loving person. They might have painful memories of their childhood because their father treated them cruelly. Jehovah would never do that to his children. He is the best Father we could have. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>) He loves us very much and takes care of us in so many ways. The more we feel loved by Jehovah, the more we will love him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) In this article, we will discuss four ways that Jehovah shows his love for us.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When the apostle Paul was in Athens, Greece, he noticed that there were many idols and that people believed that their gods gave them life. So he told them about “the God who made the world and all the things in it.” He said that God “gives to all people life and breath and all things” and that “by him we have life and move and exist.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:24-44:17:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 17:24, 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Jehovah gives us everything we need to live and to enjoy life.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For example, Jehovah prepared a beautiful home for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:15-19:115:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 115:15, 16</a>) Out of all the planets that he created, the earth seems to be unique. Scientists have explored space and have discovered many planets, but they still cannot find another planet that has everything humans need to survive. Jehovah not only gave us everything we need to stay alive, but he also made the earth a beautiful, comfortable, and safe place where we can enjoy life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>) When we think about the home that our Father, Jehovah, has given us, we truly feel how much he loves us.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Job 38:4,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>7;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:8:3-19:8:5" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> <strong>Psalm 8:3-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) This means that we can feel his love for us and then express our love for him. He knows that this is what makes us truly happy. After all, children are happiest when they feel that their parents love them. And remember, Jesus taught us that we will be happy if we are close to our Father, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) He gives us “all the things we enjoy.” Clearly, he is very generous and loves us very much.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:17-54:6:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Psalm 145:16</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) So he tells us what his name is. In fact, the Bible mentions his name more than any other name. Jehovah also tells us what kind of Person he is. When we look at the things he created, we learn that he is powerful and wise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>) And when we read the Bible, we learn how fair he is and how much he loves us.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah also teaches us what his purpose is. He tells us that we are part of his family. He also explains what he expects from us so that we can work unitedly and peacefully with everyone in his family. The Bible clearly shows that God did not create us with the right to decide for ourselves what is good and what is bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) Jehovah knows what is best for us.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When Jehovah saw that Cain was in danger of doing something very bad, he tried to help Cain by asking him: “Why are you so angry and dejected?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:11-1:4:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Genesis 4:11-13</a>) Another time, Jehovah noticed <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that Baruch’s wrong attitude was making him feel tired and discouraged.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jehovah guides and disciplines us because he loves us.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:6-58:12:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:6</a>) In the Bible, we read of faithful servants whom Jehovah trained to become better people. For example, Joseph, Moses, and David went through extremely difficult times. During their trials, Jehovah was with them. And the things they learned during those trials helped them when Jehovah gave them greater responsibilities. As we read in the Bible how Jehovah supports and trains his people, we feel that Jehovah truly loves us.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 3:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:19:35-12:19:35" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Kings 19:35</a>) In the first century, angels rescued Peter, Paul, and others from prison.

The country was in chaos because of all the fighting, stealing, raping, and killing. Although none of the brothers died, many lost everything they owned. But they all felt Jehovah’s love and knew that he was taking care of them. Despite everything they had suffered, they were still happy. When a headquarters representative visited them and asked the brothers and sisters how they were doing, they said, “All is well, thanks to Jehovah!”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Of course, some of Jehovah’s servants, such as the disciple Stephen and others like him, have died because they were faithful. Jehovah does not always prevent this from happening. But he does protect his people as a group by warning them about the different ways Satan tries to trick them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:10-49:6:12" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:10-12</a>) We find these warnings in the Bible and in the publications from Jehovah’s organization.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">ONE night, the apostle Peter and some of the disciples struggled to row across the Sea of Galilee during a storm. Suddenly, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. Peter called out to Jesus and asked if he could walk across the water to him. When Jesus told him to come, Peter got out of the boat and started walking toward him. But soon after, Peter started to sink. Why? Because he looked at the storm and the waves and became afraid. Peter shouted for help and Jesus quickly grabbed him and said: “You with <strong>little faith, </strong>why did you give way to doubt?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:14:24-40:14:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 14:24-32</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Peter had strong faith. Why can we say that? When Jesus called him, Peter climbed out of the boat and walked on water. He trusted that God’s power would give him that ability in the same way it did for Jesus. Similarly, when Jesus invited us to follow him, we dedicated ourselves to Jehovah and got baptized. Why?

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Faith is something precious. Peter’s faith gave him the ability to walk on water, something that seemed impossible for a human. Faith can also help us to do what may seem impossible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:21-40:21:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 21:21, 22</a>) Some of us have changed our attitude and behavior so much that people who knew us before no longer recognize us. We made these changes because we love Jehovah and because he helped us to make them. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:5-51:3:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 3:5-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Faith motivated us to dedicate ourselves to Jehovah, and we became his friends, something we could never have done without his help.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:8-49:2:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Our faith makes us strong.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) To what might we compare the wind and waves that scared Peter? (b) Why must we understand that it is possible to lose our faith?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As Peter walked on the Sea of Galilee, he became afraid. Why? Because of the wind and the waves. These might be compared to the many trials and temptations Christians experience today. Even if these problems are very difficult, we can be strong with Jehovah’s help. But remember what happened to Peter. He did not sink because of the wind and the waves hitting him. Instead, the Bible says: “Looking at the windstorm, he became afraid.” <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:14:30-40:14:30" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 14:30</a>) Peter stopped looking at Jesus and focused on the power of the storm. Then his faith started to weaken. In a similar way, if we focus on our problems, we can begin to doubt that Jehovah will help us.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">If we focus on the wrong things, our faith could quickly become weak</p>
</div>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We must understand that it is possible to lose our faith. Why? Because the Bible says that loss of faith is “the sin that <strong>easily </strong>entangles us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:1-58:12:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:1</a>) Similar to Peter, if we focus on the wrong things, our faith could quickly become weak. So how can we know if our faith is in danger? The following questions will help us to examine ourselves.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How might God’s promises seem less real to us than they once did?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>Are God’s promises as real to me now as they were before? </strong>For example, God has promised to destroy Satan’s world. However, are we distracted by the many different types of entertainment his world offers? If so, we might start to doubt that the end is near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:3</a>) Think about another example. Jehovah provided the ransom, and he promised to forgive our mistakes. But if we keep focusing on our past mistakes, we may begin to doubt that Jehovah has really forgiven us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) As a result, we could lose our joy in God’s service and stop preaching to others.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What could happen if we focus our life on personal interests?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Do I still give Jehovah my very best? </strong>When we work hard for Jehovah, it helps us to focus on our hope for the future. However, what if we have started to focus more on our own interests? For example, we might accept a job that pays well but limits our service to Jehovah. This could weaken our faith, and we could “become sluggish,” doing less for Jehovah than we really can.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:10-58:6:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10-12</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How do we show faith in Jehovah when we forgive others?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>Is it hard for me to forgive? </strong>When others offend or hurt us, are we tempted to get angry with them or stop speaking to them? If so, we could be focusing too much on our own feelings. We show our faith in Jehovah when we forgive others. How so? If someone sins against us, they owe us a debt. When we sin against Jehovah, we owe him a debt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:4-42:11:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) So when we forgive others, we are trusting in Jehovah. <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>We trust him to bless our attitude, and his blessing is much more valuable than making someone pay for what he did to us. Jesus’ disciples learned that faith is needed to forgive others. When Jesus told them to forgive even those who sinned against them many times, his disciples begged him: “Give us more faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:1-42:17:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 17:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why might we fail to learn from counsel?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><strong>Am</strong> <strong>I offended when given counsel? </strong>Look for ways to learn from counsel instead of looking for mistakes in the counsel or weaknesses in the one who gave it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:20-20:19:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:20</a>) Do not miss an opportunity to learn to think more like Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What may be wrong if a person always complains about those taking the lead?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>Do I complain about those taking the lead in the congregation? </strong>When the Israelites focused on the bad report of the ten spies, they complained about Moses and Aaron. Then Jehovah asked Moses: “How much longer will they not put faith <strong>in me?” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:2-4:14:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Numbers 14:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:11-4:14:11" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Yes, Jehovah knew that the Israelites did not trust in him because they complained against Moses and Aaron, men whom he had appointed. In a similar way, if we always complain about those whom Jehovah uses to lead his people today, this may show that our faith in God has weakened.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>Why should we not be disappointed if we see some weaknesses in our faith?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>After considering these questions, do not be disappointed if you see that your faith has weakened. Remember <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>that even the apostle Peter became afraid and began to doubt. And at times, Jesus counseled all the apostles for having “little faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:8-40:16:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 16:8</a>) Yet, we can learn an important lesson from Peter’s experience. Notice what he did <strong>after </strong>he started to doubt and sink into the sea.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Just as Peter focused on Jesus again for help, we too must “look intently” at Jesus. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 12:2, 3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But we cannot see him with our eyes the way Peter could. So how can we “look intently” at Jesus? We can study the things he taught and did and then imitate him very closely. When we do that, we will get the help we need to strengthen our faith.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) To imitate Jesus, we must read the Bible every day, study it, and meditate on the lessons we learn. We must also search for answers to questions we might have. For example, do you strongly believe that we live in the last days? Strengthen your faith that the end is near by studying Bible prophecies that prove we are living in the last days. Do you want to strengthen your faith in God’s promises for the future? Then study Bible prophecies that have been fulfilled. Do you really believe that the Bible is practical today?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2</a>) He was never distracted by what the world could offer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:8-40:4:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 4:8-10</a>) How can we imitate Jesus’ example? Meditate on the wonderful promises Jehovah has made.

See these as God’s <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>promises, not just to people in general, but to you personally.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup>Pray for more faith. </strong>Jesus taught his disciples to ask Jehovah for holy spirit.

His goal is to become a mature Christian. This maturity does not refer to becoming older in age. It refers to spiritual growth, that is, having a closer relationship with Jehovah. The apostle Paul wanted Christians in Ephesus to become mature. He encouraged them to be united in the faith and to keep learning about Jesus in order to become “a full-grown man, attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:13-49:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:13</a>.</p>

For example, thousands are baptized each year, so some still need to grow to maturity. What about you?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:2:6-51:2:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) He also shows mildness, self-control, and patience. These qualities can help him to endure <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>difficult situations without becoming annoyed and to endure disappointments without losing hope. In his personal study, a mature Christian keeps searching for Bible principles that help him to know what is right and what is wrong.

A mature Christian is humble, so he believes that Jehovah’s direction and standards are always better than his own.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How well did Jesus know and understand the Bible?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus Christ knew and understood the Scriptures well. Even when he was 12 years old, he used the Scriptures <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>when talking to teachers at the temple. “All those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:46-42:2:47" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 2:46, 47</a>) Later, when he was preaching, he skillfully used God’s Word to silence his enemies.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:41-40:22:46" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 22:41-46</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>(a) What study schedule does a mature Christian have? (b) Why do we study the Bible?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>A person who wants to become a mature Christian imitates Jesus’ example and wants to understand the Bible as much as he can. He regularly searches the Scriptures for deep truths, because he knows that “solid food belongs to mature people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) A mature Christian wants to have an “accurate knowledge” of the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:13-49:4:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:13</a>) So ask yourself: ‘Do I read the Bible daily? Do I have a schedule for personal study? Do I have family worship each week?’ When you study the Bible, search for principles that can help you to know how Jehovah thinks and feels. Then use these principles when you make decisions. That will help you draw even closer to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How does a mature Christian feel about God’s counsel and principles?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>A mature Christian must do more than simply know what the Bible says. He must <strong>love </strong>God’s counsel and principles. Then he shows this love by his desire to do Jehovah’s will instead of his own. He even changes the way he lives, thinks, and acts. For example, he imitates Jesus and develops the new personality, which is “created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 4:22-24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>It is important to remember that God used his holy spirit to guide the Bible writers. So when a Christian studies the Bible, God’s holy spirit helps him to grow in knowledge, grow in love, and grow in his relationship with Jehovah.</p>

<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>PROMOTE UNITY</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What did Jesus experience while on earth?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jesus was a perfect man. However, when he was on the earth, Jesus was surrounded by imperfect people. His parents and his brothers and sisters were all imperfect. Even Jesus’ closest followers showed qualities such as pride and selfishness. For example, on the night before his death, his disciples argued among themselves “over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:24-42:22:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:24</a>) Despite their imperfect thinking, Jesus knew that his followers would soon become mature Christians and form a united congregation. That same night, Jesus prayed for them to be united. He asked his heavenly Father that they all be one, saying: “Just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you.” He added: “In order that they may be one just as we are one.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:21-43:17:22" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 17:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>(a) What is our goal as Christians? (b) How did one brother learn to promote unity?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>A mature Christian promotes unity <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>in the congregation. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:1-49:4:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 4:1-6,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:15-49:4:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <strong>15, 16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>As Christians, our goal is to be “harmoniously joined together,” that is, to work together in unity. To have this kind of unity, a Christian must be humble. So even when he is affected by the imperfections of others, a mature Christian works hard to keep the unity of the congregation strong. Therefore, ask yourself: ‘How do I react when a brother or a sister makes a mistake? How do I feel when someone hurts me? Do I usually stop talking to that person? Or do I try to repair the relationship?’ A mature Christian wants to overcome a problem rather than be a problem to others.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Consider the example of Uwe. In the past, he used to let the imperfections of brothers and sisters upset him. Then he decided to use the Bible and <em>Insight on the Scriptures </em>to study the life of David. Why David? Because David had also experienced problems with some of God’s servants. For example, King Saul tried to kill David, some of the people wanted to stone him, and even his own wife laughed at him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:19:9-9:19:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Samuel 19:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:30:1-9:30:6" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 30:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:6:14-10:6:22" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2 Samuel 6:14-22</a>) But despite what others did to him, David loved Jehovah and trusted in him. David also showed mercy. Uwe admits that he needed to do the same. Through his study of the Bible, he learned that he needed to change how he felt about his brothers’ imperfections. He needed to stop remembering their mistakes and promote unity in the congregation. Is it your goal to do the same?</p>

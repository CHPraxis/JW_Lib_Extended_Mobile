BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Will the dead live again?






Surely the Creator of life can restore life





Jehovah God is the Source of life. (Psalm 36:9) Does it not seem reasonable, then, that the same God could restore life to those who have died? The Bible assures us that he will do just that in the future. (Read Acts 24:15) But why will he do so?
Our Creator originally intended for man to live forever on earth. (Genesis 1:31; 2:15-17) This is still what he wants for mankind. It pains him to see what we deal with now—lives that are full of trouble and that end all too quickly.—Read Job 14:1, 14, 15.



Where will the resurrected live?

Did God create man to live in heaven? No. God created angels to live in heaven. He made humans to live on the earth. (Genesis 1:28; Job 38:4, 7) With that in mind, consider the resurrections Jesus performed. He restored people to life right here on earth. Likewise, most of those resurrected in the future will return to life on the earth.—Read John 5:28, 29; 11:44.
However, God has chosen a few people to be resurrected to life in heaven, where they will have spirit bodies. (Luke 12:32; 1 Corinthians 15:49, 50) Those resurrected to heaven will rule as kings with Christ over the earth.—Read Revelation 5:9, 10.

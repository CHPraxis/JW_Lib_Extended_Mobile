Conclusion




Do you ever reminisce about the good times you had with Jehovah’s people​—an encouraging congregation meeting, a thrilling convention, a delightful experience in the ministry, or simply a pleasant conversation with a fellow believer? You have not forgotten Jehovah; neither has he forgotten you. He fondly remembers your faithful service. And he is eager to help you return to him.
“I myself will search for my sheep,” says Jehovah, “and I will care for them. I will care for my sheep like a shepherd who has found his scattered sheep and is feeding them. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered.”​—Ezekiel 34:11, 12.

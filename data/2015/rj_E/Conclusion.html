<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you ever reminisce about the good times you had with Jehovah’s people​—an encouraging congregation meeting, a thrilling convention, a delightful experience in the ministry, or simply a pleasant conversation with a fellow believer? You have not forgotten Jehovah; neither has he forgotten you. He fondly remembers your faithful service. And he is eager to help you return to him.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I myself will search for my sheep,” says Jehovah, “and I will care for them. I will care for my sheep like a shepherd who has found his scattered sheep and is feeding them. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:11-26:34:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:11, 12</a>.</p>

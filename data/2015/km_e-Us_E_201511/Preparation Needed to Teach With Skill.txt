Preparation Needed to Teach With Skill




Jesus was asked the same question about everlasting life on at least two occasions, but each time he tailored his reply to the needs of the questioner. (Luke 10:25-28; 18:18-20) Therefore, although we may know the Bible study material well, we should prepare it beforehand with the student in mind. What points might he struggle to understand or accept? Which of the cited scriptures should we read with him? How much material should we try to cover? We may need to prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp the information. In addition, since it is Jehovah who makes the seed of truth grow in the heart, we should ask for Jehovah’s blessing on our preparation for the study, on our student, and on our efforts to help him spiritually.—1 Cor. 3:6; Jas. 1:5.

Field Service Highlights




When comparing the first nine months of this service year with the same period last year, the United States (the 50 states, including Alaska and Hawaii) had increases of 1.1 percent in publishers, 4.6 percent in regular pioneers, and 1.9 percent in Bible studies.  Certainly, the “loving labor” being put forth to reach all with the good news brings joy to our heavenly Father.—1 Thess. 1:3.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As a Bible student learns what the Bible really teaches and applies what he learns, he will grow and bear spiritual fruit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>) We can help our student progress by making good use of some helpful features of the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Introductory Questions: </strong>Each chapter begins with questions that are answered in the lesson. You could ask these questions rhetorically to whet the student’s appetite for your upcoming discussion. Or you could invite him to comment briefly on each question. If he expresses a wrong idea, there is no need to correct him at this point. His comments will help you to discern what points require attention and emphasis.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:23-20:16:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 16:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Appendix: </strong>If the student understands and accepts the material in the main text, you can simply encourage him to review the corresponding appendix material on his own. At the next study, you might take a few minutes to make sure that he understands it. However, if it would benefit him, you should take time during the study to discuss the appendix material or a portion thereof by reading the paragraphs and asking questions that you prepared in advance.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Review Box: </strong>The review box at the end of each chapter contains statements that answer the introductory questions. You can use this feature to make sure that your student understands and can explain the main points. Read each statement together out loud as well as any accompanying scriptures. Then invite your student to use the scripture(s) to explain why the statement is true.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:2-44:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:2, 3</a>.</p>

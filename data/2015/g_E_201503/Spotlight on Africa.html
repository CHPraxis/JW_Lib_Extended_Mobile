<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A total of 1,004 rhinos in South Africa were illegally killed in 2013, compared with just 13 in 2007.

Yet, some 90 percent of the people who encounter bribery do not report it. A spokesman for the organization’s Kenya chapter says: “Citizens do not seem to trust their governments to respond to the reports on corruption.”</p>

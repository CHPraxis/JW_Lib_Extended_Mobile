<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">SHORTLY before the nation of Israel entered the Promised Land, tens of thousands of men committed “sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab.” As a result, 24,000 Israelites died. They had waited so long and were so close to receiving their inheritance! Sadly, they lost a wonderful reward because they gave in to the temptation to commit immorality.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:25:1-4:25:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 25:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:25:9-4:25:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>

They are now suffering the sad consequences of their actions, and if they are not repentant, they could <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>even lose the opportunity to live forever in Paradise on earth.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why have some Christians been tempted to commit immorality?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>How is it possible for a Christian to be tempted to commit immorality? It often starts with the eyes. Jesus explained: “Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:14-61:2:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:14</a>) Many who have committed immorality have lowered their moral standards by viewing pornography, reading erotic literature, or watching shocking material on the Internet. Others have watched movies, stage plays, or television programs that are sexually explicit. Still others have visited nightclubs and strip shows or have gone to places to have sensual or immoral massages.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Why do we need to guard our imperfect heart?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Some give in to temptation because they seek attention from someone other than their marriage mate. We live in a world where people have very little self-control and find pleasure in every kind of immorality. Also, because our imperfect heart is deceitful and desperate, we may easily develop romantic feelings for someone other than our husband or wife. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:9-24:17:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah 17:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus said: “Out of the heart come wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:15:19-40:15:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 15:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) What can happen if wrong desires develop in our heart? (b) How can we avoid sinning against Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Once wrong desires have developed in their hearts, two people who are attracted to each other may start having conversations about things that they should discuss only with their own husband or wife. Soon, they make more and more excuses to be together. They meet each other more frequently, pretending that they just met by accident. As their feelings for each other become more intense, it becomes more difficult to do what is right. The more their relationship grows, the more difficult it is to end it, even though they know that what they are doing is wrong.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:7:21-20:7:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 7:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They completely forget Jehovah’s moral standards as wrong desires and conversations turn into holding hands, kissing, caressing, and touching each other in a sexual way. Sadly, they are doing things that they should do only with their own marriage <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>mate. They are “drawn out and enticed [“caught as by bait,” footnote]” by their own desire. Finally, when the desire is strong enough, they commit sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>) It is tragic because both individuals could have avoided sinning against Jehovah if they had allowed him to strengthen their respect for marriage. How can a person develop such respect?</p>

When we learn about his wonderful qualities, we try to “become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love.” As a result, we will have the strength to reject “sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:1-49:5:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1-4</a>) Husbands and wives who know that “God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers” work hard to remain faithful to each other.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>.</p>

Others have also been tempted while at work. That is what happened to a young man named Joseph. While at work, he realized that his employer’s wife was very attracted to him. Day after day she tried to tempt him to have sex with her. Eventually, “she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said: ‘Lie down with me!’” But Joseph refused and ran away. How could Joseph be strong enough to remain faithful? It was because he was determined to protect his friendship with God. Joseph did lose his job and was sent to prison, but Jehovah blessed him.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>One of the best ways to keep our marriage strong is to talk to our marriage mate in a kind way. Unfortunately, some husbands and wives speak to each other with less respect than they do to strangers or even to their pets! When “malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech” are in a marriage, they slowly weaken a couple’s relationship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31</a>) A critical and hurtful attitude will damage a marriage. So couples need to strengthen their relationship by speaking to each other in a kind, tender, and compassionate way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>

One wife in Germany says: “Under such circumstances, silence can hurt your partner.” She adds: “Even though it is not always easy to keep calm under stress, it is not good just to let off steam. Then you impulsively say or do something that can hurt your marriage mate, and that <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>only makes matters worse.” Husbands and wives do not solve their problems by screaming or by refusing to talk to each other. Instead, couples strengthen their marriage when they choose to settle disagreements quickly and do not let them grow into arguments.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>How can good communication strengthen a marriage?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>You can make your marriage stronger when you take time to share your thoughts and feelings with each other. <strong>How </strong>you say something is as important as <strong>what </strong>you say.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Couples can also build a strong marriage when they put the personal needs of their mate ahead of their own. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3, 4</a>) Husbands as well as wives need to be sensitive to each other’s emotional and sexual needs.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:3-46:7:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 7:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Sadly, some marriage mates do not show affection or are not intimate with each other. And some men think that if they are gentle with their wife, it means that they are weak. But the Bible says: “You husbands should try to understand the wives you live with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>, <em>Phillips</em>) A husband needs to understand that the marriage due does not just involve having intercourse. He needs to be loving and affectionate at <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>all times. Then his wife is more likely to enjoy sexual relations. When both show love and affection, it will be easier to satisfy each other’s emotional and physical needs.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>How can husbands and wives strengthen their relationship?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Although there is no excuse for us to be unfaithful to our marriage mate, a lack of tenderness could be one of the reasons why a husband or a wife seeks love and intimacy from someone else. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:5:18-20:5:18" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:9-21:9:9" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>) That is why the Bible counsels married couples not to “deprive each other” of the marriage due unless both have agreed to do so for a short time. Why? “In order that Satan may not keep tempting you for your lack of self-control.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:5-46:7:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>) It would be so tragic for a couple to allow Satan to use their “lack of self-control” to tempt either mate to commit adultery! By giving the marriage due, each mate seeks, “not his own advantage, but that of the other person.” They do this because they love each other, not because it is their duty.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Why should we be thankful to Jehovah? As foretold, people in the last days have become very ungrateful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:2-55:3:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:2</a>) Many do not appreciate the good things Jehovah has done for them. We live in a materialistic world that encourages millions of people to buy <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>more than they really need. As a result, many are not satisfied with what they already have.

First, we need to look for the ways Jehovah has blessed us personally. And then, we need to think carefully about how those blessings show God’s great love for us.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We can learn how to be grateful to Jehovah by considering the example of the apostle Paul. We know that he meditated on his blessings because he regularly thanked God in prayer. Paul recognized that he had been “a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.” He was grateful that, despite his past, God and Christ had shown him mercy and had given him the privilege of preaching to others. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:12-54:1:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:12-14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul was also very grateful for his Christian brothers and sisters and often thanked Jehovah for their good qualities and faithful service.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How can we imitate Paul’s example? We can meditate on what Jehovah has done for us personally.

Would you include your precious relationship with Jehovah? Or the forgiveness of your sins because of Christ’s ransom sacrifice? Would you mention Christian brothers and sisters who have helped you during difficult times? Would you say how grateful you are for your marriage mate or children?

He says: “At one point I was remembering a pleasant time that my wife and I had spent together, and I thanked Jehovah in prayer for that memory. I felt a sense of relief and thereafter started to thank Jehovah regularly for such happy memories. Gratefulness has made a big difference in my outlook.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Give Thanks to Jehovah and Be Blessed
We can remain grateful by meditating on our blessings and thanking Jehovah for them. If we appreciate all that Jehovah has done for us, it will help us to avoid becoming unthankful and will help us to cope with trials. Our yeartext for 2015 will remind us of this throughout the coming year.

▪  Why We Observe the Lord’s Evening Meal
This article explains why we should attend the Memorial of Jesus’ death. It describes what the bread and the wine represent. It explains how a person knows whether he or she should partake of these emblems. This article will also help us to see how we can personally prepare for the Lord’s Evening Meal.

▪  Build a Strong and Happy Marriage

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">IN Jerusalem, on the night of Nisan 14, 33 C.E., there was a full moon. Jesus and his apostles celebrated the Passover, a memorial that reminded people of the way Jehovah delivered Israel from Egypt 1,500 years before. Jesus had a special meal with his 11 loyal apostles, a meal that his followers would repeat yearly to remember his death.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:1-40:26:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 26:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jesus said a prayer, passed unleavened bread to his apostles, and said: “Take, eat.” Then he took a cup of wine, prayed again, and said: “Drink out of it, all of you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:26-40:26:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26, 27</a>) The bread and the wine had special meaning. Jesus’ faithful apostles learned many things on that important night.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jesus wanted his disciples to remember his death <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>yearly.

Why should we remember Jesus’ death? What is the meaning of the bread and the wine? How can we prepare for the Memorial? Who should partake? And how do Christians show that they value their hope?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:49:6-19:49:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 49:6-9</a>) But Jesus gave his perfect life for us and presented to God the value of that ransom.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>During his last meal with his apostles, Jesus did not perform a miracle by changing the bread into his body or the wine into his blood. He said of the bread: “This <strong>means </strong>my body.” He said of the wine: “This <strong>means </strong>my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:22-41:14:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 14:22-24</a>) It is clear that the bread and the wine are symbols, or emblems.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What does the unleavened bread represent?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>On that important evening, Jesus used unleavened bread from the Passover meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:8-2:12:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Exodus 12:8</a>) The Bible sometimes uses leaven to represent sin.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The wine Jesus used represented his blood, or his life, as does the wine we use at the Memorial today. <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>At a place outside Jerusalem called Golgotha, he died for us and gave his life “for forgiveness of sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:33-40:27:33" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 27:33</a>) If we appreciate that precious gift, we will personally prepare each year for this special occasion.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>(a) Why should we use the schedule for Memorial Bible reading? (b) How do you feel about the ransom?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>One way to prepare for the Memorial is to use the schedule for Memorial Bible reading found in <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily. </em>Reading the Bible accounts will help us to meditate on what Jesus did just before his death.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) “We look forward to the Memorial,” wrote one sister. “It becomes more special each year. I remember standing in the funeral home . . . , looking at my dear dad and coming to a true heartfelt appreciation for the ransom. . . . Oh, I knew all the scriptures and how to explain them! But only when I felt the cold reality of death did my heart fairly leap with joy over what will be accomplished for us by means of that precious ransom.” Meditating on how Jesus’ sacrifice will help us personally is an important part of preparing for the Memorial.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Another way we can prepare is to increase the time we spend in the ministry, inviting as many people as possible to the Memorial. Perhaps we could auxiliary pioneer. When we talk to others about God, his <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Son, and the hope of everlasting life, we will feel satisfied that we have done what God wants us to do.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 148:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why did Paul say that some Corinthians ate and drank unworthily at the Memorial?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When preparing for the Memorial, meditate on what Paul wrote to the Christians in Corinth. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:27-46:11:34" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 11:27-34</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He said that if a person who ate the bread and drank the wine did so unworthily, or disrespectfully, he would be guilty regarding “the body and the blood of the Lord.” So if an anointed person is involved in wrong conduct and partakes of the emblems, he “eats and drinks judgment against himself.” In Paul’s time, many of the Corinthians were involved in wrong conduct. Possibly, some of them ate and drank too much before or during the Memorial and became sleepy. They were showing great disrespect for the occasion, so when they partook of the emblems, God did not approve.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>(a) What did Paul compare the Memorial to? What warning did he give to partakers? (b) What should a partaker do if he has seriously sinned?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Comparing the Memorial to a meal, Paul warned partakers: “You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; you cannot be partaking of ‘the table of Jehovah’ and the table of demons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:16-46:10:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:16-21</a>) If a person who partakes of the emblems has seriously sinned, he must go to the elders for help. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>James 5:14-16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If his actions prove that he has sincerely repented, then he is not showing disrespect for Jesus’ sacrifice when he partakes at the Memorial.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:8-42:3:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 3:8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:15-48:6:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Galatians 6:15, 16</a>) Jesus’ death made this agreement possible.

It does not mean that they do not want to live on the earth. They know that if they are faithful until their death, they will be kings in heaven with Jesus. And they know that they “have an anointing from the holy one,” Jehovah. Today there are only a few of these 144,000 sons of God left on earth.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">LOVE is Jehovah God’s main quality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:16</a>) His first creation, Jesus Christ, spent billions of years in heaven with his Father and learned what a loving God Jehovah is. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>) Jesus has shown the same type of love during his entire life, both in heaven and on earth. So we can be sure that Jehovah and Jesus will always rule in a loving way.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>When someone asked Jesus which was the greatest commandment, Jesus said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-39</a>.</p>

Jesus said that we must love Jehovah and also love our neighbor. But who is our “neighbor”? If we are married, our closest neighbor is our husband or wife.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah created Adam and Eve and brought them together. That was the first marriage. God wanted them to have a happy marriage and fill the earth with their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28</a>) However, after they disobeyed Jehovah, their marriage was damaged, and sin and death were passed on to all of us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Despite that, a marriage can be successful today. In the Bible, Jehovah, the Creator of marriage, has given the very best advice for husbands and wives.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 3:16, 17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Bible shows that warm and tender love is essential for happy relationships. This is certainly true in marriage. The apostle Paul described genuine love when he said: “Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:4-46:13:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a>) When we think about Paul’s words and apply them, we can have a happy marriage.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) What does the Bible say about being a head? (b) How must a Christian husband treat his wife?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah decided who should be the head of the family. Paul explained: “I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) But Jehovah expects the husband to be a loving head, never mean or cruel. Jehovah himself is a kind and unselfish Head. As a result, Jesus respects God’s loving authority. He said: “I love the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:31-43:14:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 14:31</a>) Jesus would not feel that way if Jehovah were harsh with him.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Even though a husband is the head of his wife, the Bible tells him to honor her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>) How can a husband do that? He can consider what she needs and respect her preferences. The <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Bible says: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25</a>) Yes, Jesus even gave his life for his followers. When a husband is a loving head like Jesus, it will be easier for a wife to love and respect him and honor his decisions.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:3-56:2:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Titus 2:3-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

But besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:12-51:3:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12-14</a>) How thankful we are that love, “a perfect bond of union,” exists among us no matter where we come from!</p>

Motivated by love for neighbor and with the help of God’s holy spirit, that small group of anointed brothers and sisters preached the good news of the Kingdom despite difficulties. What has been the result? Today a great crowd of people who have the hope of living forever on earth is being gathered. There are about 8,000,000 Witnesses in more than 115,400 congregations around the world, and the number keeps growing. For example, over 275,500 new Witnesses were baptized in the 2014 service year.

Some people listen to us, while others hate our message. How does Jehovah expect us to feel toward those who do not worship him? No matter how people react to our message, we follow the counsel found in the Bible. It says: “Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should answer each person.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>) Whenever we defend our beliefs, we want to do so “with a mild temper and deep respect” because we love our neighbor.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:15</a>.</p>

He explained: “You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:43-40:5:45" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matthew 5:43-45</a>) As God’s servants, we must love our enemies no matter how they treat us.</p>

For the law code, ‘You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this saying: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore, love is the law’s fulfillment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:13:8-45:13:10" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 13:8-10</a>) In this divided, violent, wicked world ruled by Satan, God’s servants show genuine love for their neighbor.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">THE Bible tells us that “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) But what does this really mean? Love is not just one of Jehovah’s many beautiful qualities. It is his main quality. He does not just <strong>have </strong>love. He <strong>is </strong>love. Love guides everything he does. How thankful we are that love motivated Jehovah to create the entire universe and all living things!</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah has kind and tender feelings for his creation. His love for us gives us confidence that his purpose for mankind will come true in the best possible way. The result will be real happiness for those who obey him. For example, because of love, Jehovah “has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed,” Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:31-44:17:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:31</a>) We are confident that this judgment will happen. For <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>obedient humans, it will mean a wonderful future that will last forever.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why did Jehovah allow rebellion against his rule?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When Satan rebelled against God’s rulership, he also influenced our first parents to rebel. He questioned God’s right to be the Universal Sovereign. Satan claimed that his rule would be better than God’s. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5</a>) Wisely, Jehovah allowed Satan a short time to try to prove his claim.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why has God allowed wickedness?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>By allowing wickedness to continue for a period of time, Jehovah has also proved that only his rule can be successful. In the future, God will destroy all the wicked. After that, if anyone ever questions his loving way of ruling, God will act right away. He can use mankind’s history as proof that such rebels should be removed quickly. Wickedness will never be allowed again.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah has shown his great love in many ways. Think of the size and the beauty of our universe. It is made up of billions of galaxies, and each galaxy has billions of stars and planets. In our galaxy, the Milky Way, one of the stars is the sun. Without the sun, life could not exist on the earth. All these creations point to Jehovah as our Creator and show his qualities, such as his power, wisdom, and <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>love. Yes, God’s “invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Even though we are imperfect, we can obey God. We can also have a close relationship with Jehovah because of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus, the greatest act of God’s love. Jehovah provided the ransom so that obedient humans could have the opportunity to be freed from sin and death. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 5:12;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> <strong>6:23</strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Jesus was faithful to God for a very long time in heaven, so Jehovah was confident that his Son would remain faithful on earth. As a loving Father, Jehovah was deeply hurt when he saw how badly people treated his Son. Yet, Jesus faithfully supported God’s right to rule and showed that a perfect human can remain loyal to God even in the most difficult situations.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Despite the most severe tests, Jesus remained loyal and supported Jehovah’s right to rule. We should be grateful that by means of his death, Jesus paid the ransom price because it gives humans the opportunity to live forever in God’s new world! The apostle Paul described the love that Jehovah and Jesus showed through the ransom. He said: “Indeed, while we were still weak, Christ died for ungodly men at the appointed time. For hardly would anyone die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man someone may dare to die. But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:6-45:5:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 5:6-8</a>) The apostle John wrote: “By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Jesus said that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Even though it was very painful for Jehovah, he gave his Son as a ransom. This shows how much he loves humans. And that love will last forever. Paul wrote: “I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Romans 8:38, 39</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>God’s government, the Messianic Kingdom, is also proof of Jehovah’s love for mankind. How so?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:31-20:8:31" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:31</a>) In addition, 144,000 chosen from mankind will rule with Christ in heaven.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1</a>) While Jesus was on earth, the Kingdom was the main theme of his teaching, and he taught his disciples to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Be Watchful—Satan Wants to Devour You!
▪  You Can Fight Satan—And Win!
The Bible likens Satan to a roaring lion on the prowl. He is powerful, vicious, and deceptive. These articles will help us to see why we must stand firm against this dangerous enemy. They will also show us how we can protect ourselves from his deceptive tactics.

▪  They “Saw” the Things Promised
▪  Imitate the One Who Promises Everlasting Life
Our ability to think about things we have never experienced or seen can be used wisely or unwisely. In these articles, we will discuss several Bible characters. We will learn how our ability to visualize things unseen can help us to exercise faith and imitate Jehovah’s love, kindness, wisdom, and happiness.

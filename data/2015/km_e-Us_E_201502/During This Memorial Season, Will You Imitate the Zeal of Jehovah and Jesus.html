<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah accomplishes his purpose with zeal. Referring to some of the blessings of God’s Kingdom, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:7</a> says: “The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.” Similarly, during his earthly ministry, God’s Son demonstrated great zeal for true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:2:13-43:2:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 2:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:34-43:4:34" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4:34</a>) Each year during the Memorial season, millions of publishers around the world make a special effort to imitate the zeal of Jehovah and Jesus by increasing their activity in the ministry. Will you be among them?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Auxiliary Pioneer: </strong>Zeal will also motivate us to expand our ministry. No doubt many will be able to auxiliary pioneer during March and April, since we will have the option of choosing the 30-hour requirement.

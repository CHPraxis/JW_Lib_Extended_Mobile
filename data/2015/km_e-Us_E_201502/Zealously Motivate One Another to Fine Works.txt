Zealously Motivate One Another to Fine Works




Hebrews 10:24 encourages us to “consider one another so as to incite [“motivate,” ftn.] to love and fine works.” We can motivate our brothers by the example we set and by our expressions of faith. Share your good experiences with others in the congregation. Let them see the joy you feel in serving Jehovah. At the same time, avoid unfavorably comparing them to yourself or others. (Gal. 6:4) Seek to use your strengths to motivate others to “love and fine works,” not guilt and fine works. (See the Ministry School book, p. 158, par. 4.) If we incite to love, then the works—such as doing good to others materially or preaching—will follow.—2 Cor. 1:24.

Why Be “Zealous for Fine Works”?




Are you zealous for fine works? As Kingdom publishers, we have every reason to be. Why? Consider what we read at Titus 2:11-14:
           Verse 11: What is “the undeserved kindness of God,” and how have we personally benefited from it?—Rom. 3:23, 24.

           Verse 12: How have we been trained by God’s undeserved kindness?

           Verses 13 and 14: Now that we have been cleansed, what hope do we have? And for what greater purpose have we been cleansed from the world’s ungodly conduct?

            How do these verses stimulate you to be zealous for fine works?

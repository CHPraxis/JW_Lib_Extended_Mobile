<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Our zeal increases when we know how to share the truth about Jesus with others. Jesus is the foundation cornerstone on which true faith is built. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 2:20</a>) Without him, we would have no hope for life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 4:12</a>) Therefore, it is important that all recognize Jesus’ position in God’s purpose. Many have been misled by unscriptural doctrines. Sadly, they stand to lose out on the promises God’s Word holds out to those who exercise faith in Jesus. Our zeal for the truth will move us to help honesthearted ones to gain a correct understanding of Jesus, his relationship to God, and his role in God’s purpose. During this Memorial season, will you zealously proclaim the truth about Jesus?</p>

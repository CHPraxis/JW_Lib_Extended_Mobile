For the Memorial Invitation Campaign

“We’re distributing this invitation to a very important event. On April 3, millions around the world will gather to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ and to hear a free discourse about how his death benefits us. This invitation shows the time and location of the meeting being held in our community.”



The Watchtower March 1

“April 3 marks the anniversary of the death of Jesus Christ. Some in our community will meet on this date to commemorate the occasion, but there are others who do not think that Jesus’ death was significant. What’s your opinion? Do you think Jesus’ death and resurrection benefit us? [Allow for response.] Notice what God’s Word says about this. [Read 1 Corinthians 15:22, 26.] This magazine discusses a future benefit of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice—namely, that one day no one on earth will die.”



Awake! March

“We are making brief visits on our neighbors to show them the current issue of Awake! [Show the cover.] Everyone has his own viewpoint on this first question: ‘Is there a God?’ In your opinion, who has a more positive view of the future—those who believe in God or those who don’t? [Allow for response.] Here is a promise from God that gives many people hope. [Read Psalm 37:10, 11.] This magazine outlines four reasons to investigate whether God exists.”

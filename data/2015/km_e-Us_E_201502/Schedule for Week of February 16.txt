15 min: Prepare to Proclaim the Good News Zealously. Discussion. Why is praying to Jehovah the first step in preparing for the ministry? (Ps. 143:10; Acts 4:31) In addition to prayer, what else is needed? (Ezra 7:10) After preparing ourselves spiritually, what practical steps should we take to organize our literature and our service bags? What positive effect does being prepared have on us? (See The Watchtower, July 15, 2008, p. 10, par. 9.) How do you prepare for the ministry? Have a publisher demonstrate how he prepares for the ministry by reviewing the tracts, magazines, or brochures that he will be using. He then organizes his service bag and makes sure that his electronic device is ready to play. Emphasize that all should be well-prepared when going in the ministry. (2 Tim. 3:17)
15 min: “During This Memorial Season, Will You Imitate the Zeal of Jehovah and Jesus?” Questions and answers. Distribute a copy of the Memorial invitation to each person in the audience, and discuss its contents. Have a brief demonstration, using the sample presentation on page 4.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Why Important: </strong>Witnessing through an intercom can be intimidating. How can we avoid letting this challenge dampen our zeal for fine works? Keep in mind that witnessing through an intercom may be the only way to reach some people with the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:14-45:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:14</a>) Experience has shown that an effective witness can be given this way. (See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:302011017/65-66"><em>2011 Yearbook, </em>pp. 65-66</a>, and the <a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:302000004/42-42"><em>2000 Yearbook, </em>p. 54, par. 3</a>.) Consider the following suggestions.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">            Prepare a <em>brief </em>presentation, and write it out so that you can read it directly to the householder through the intercom. This can boost your confidence. At the outset, explain the purpose of your visit. Use the householder’s name if it is shown on the directory. Conclude by offering to deliver (or leave in the person’s door) a tract or a magazine that will provide more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">            Maintain a positive viewpoint. Smile and gesture as if you were speaking face-to-face with the person.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">            Relax and be conversational. Speak clearly and with good volume. Avoid unnecessary pauses, but do not speak too fast.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">            Use good judgment. In large buildings, there may be many intercoms. Perhaps you could choose just three or so to ring, take note of where you left off, and then leave. Residents of the building may become alarmed if we linger in the foyer in order to ring every intercom.</p>

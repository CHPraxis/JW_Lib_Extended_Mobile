<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are thrilled to report four new publisher peaks during the special campaign month of August 2014! The Bahamas reported 1,875 publishers, Bermuda reported 544 publishers, the Turks and Caicos Islands reported 338 publishers, and the United States reported 1,243,387 publishers. Also, the Bahamas had a new peak of 218 regular pioneers, and Puerto Rico had a new peak of 3,297 regular pioneers. Certainly, Jehovah is ‘speeding up’ the Kingdom-preaching work during this time of the end!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>.</p>

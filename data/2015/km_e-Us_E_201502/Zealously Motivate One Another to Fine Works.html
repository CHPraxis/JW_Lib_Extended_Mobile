Share your good experiences with others in the congregation. Let them see the joy you feel in serving Jehovah. At the same time, avoid unfavorably comparing them to yourself or others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:4</a>) Seek to use your strengths to motivate others to <em>“love </em>and fine works,” not <em>guilt </em>and fine works. (See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:1102001092/14-14"><em>Ministry School </em>book, p. 158, par. 4</a>.) If we incite to <em>love, </em>then the works<wbr />—such as doing good to others materially or preaching—<wbr />will follow.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:24-47:1:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:24</a>.</p>

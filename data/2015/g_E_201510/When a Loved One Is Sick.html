<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“When Dad was about to be released from the hospital, we asked his doctor to review Dad’s blood tests with us. The doctor assured us that the results were normal, but he kindly looked them up. To his surprise, two of the results were above normal! He apologized and called a specialist. Dad is doing well now. But we are very glad that we asked questions.”​—Maribel.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Medical appointments and hospital stays can be nerve-racking. As Maribel’s experience shows, the assistance of a friend or a relative can be very helpful​—possibly even life-saving. How can you help a loved one?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Before the visit. </strong>Help the patient write down his symptoms as well as any medications or supplements he takes. Also list any questions that should be asked of the physician. Help your friend recall any details of his condition or any family history of the illness. Do not assume that the doctor already knows those details or will ask for them.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>During the visit. </strong>Be sure you and the patient understand what the doctor says. Ask questions, but avoid making assertions. Allow the patient to ask questions and to speak for himself. Pay attention, and take careful notes. Ask about treatment options. In some cases, it may be wise to suggest to the patient that he get a second opinion.</p>

In many hospitals, patients are seen by various doctors. You can help them by communicating what others on the staff have said. You know the patient, so point out any changes you notice in his physical or mental state.</p>

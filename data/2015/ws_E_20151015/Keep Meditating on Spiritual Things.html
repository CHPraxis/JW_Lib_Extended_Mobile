<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">THE human brain is unique. For example, humans have the ability to learn a language. And language allows us to read, write, speak, and understand what we hear. It also gives us the ability to pray and sing praises to Jehovah. All of this makes us different from animals. Scientists cannot fully understand just how our brain is able to do these amazing things.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Our ability to use language is a gift from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>) He has also given us another gift that makes us different from animals. Humans were created “in God’s image.” We have free will, that is, the freedom to make our own choices. And we can choose to use language to serve and praise Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah has shown us how to serve and praise him by <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>giving us the Bible. The entire Bible or parts of it are available in more than 2,800 languages. When we meditate on what the Bible says, we can begin to think the way God thinks.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What does it mean to meditate, and what questions will we discuss?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>To meditate means to concentrate on something and think deeply and carefully about it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:77:12-19:77:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 77:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:1-20:24:2" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Proverbs 24:1, 2</a>) We benefit the most when we meditate on what we learn about Jehovah and Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) In this article we will answer the following questions: How can we read in a way that makes it easier to meditate? What can we meditate on? And what can help us to meditate regularly and to enjoy it?</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What can help you to remember and better understand what you read?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Have you ever noticed that there are some things you can do without even thinking about them, such as breathing, walking, or riding a bicycle? Unfortunately, you might at times even read without thinking. Perhaps you may even start thinking about other things while you are reading. What can you do to prevent this? It is important to concentrate on what you are reading and think about what it <strong>means. </strong>Then, when you get to the end of a paragraph or subheading in a publication, pause and meditate on what you just read. Think about what you learned, and make sure that you really understood it.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote floatEast"><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">Reading the Bible aloud will help you to concentrate better and to remember more</p>
</div>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Scientists have discovered that it is easier to remember something when we read it <strong>aloud. </strong>Our Creator knows this, and that is why he told Joshua to read the book of the Law “in an undertone,” that is, to read it softly to himself. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Joshua 1:8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Reading the Bible aloud will also help you to concentrate better and to remember more.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>When is the best time to meditate on the Bible? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>It requires a lot of effort to meditate and concentrate on what we study. That is why it is best to meditate at a time when you are not tired and in a place that is quiet, where not many things will distract you. The psalmist David meditated while he was awake in bed during the night. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:63:6-19:63:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 63:6</a>) Jesus, who was perfect, chose quiet places to meditate and pray.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:12-42:6:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 6:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>In addition to what you read in the Bible, there are other things you can meditate on. For example, when you see one of Jehovah’s marvelous creations, pause and ask yourself, ‘What does this teach me about Jehovah?’ Such thoughts will surely move you to thank Jehovah in prayer. And if you are with others, you will want to share your feelings with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:17-44:14:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Acts 14:17</a>) Jehovah pays attention and is pleased when we meditate, pray, and talk about him to one another. The Bible assures us: “A book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah and for those <strong>meditating </strong>on his name.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Malachi 3:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul told Timothy to meditate on how his speech, his conduct, and his teaching affected others. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:12-54:4:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 4:12-16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>You too can meditate on these things. For example, you need time to meditate when you prepare for a Bible study. Think of your student, and try to find a question or an illustration that will help him to make progress. When <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>you prepare for your Bible studies in this way, your own faith is strengthened and you become a better and more enthusiastic teacher of the Bible. You will also benefit when you meditate before going out in field service. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/15:7:10-15:7:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Ezra 7:10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Perhaps you can read a chapter from the book of Acts to help you become more zealous for the ministry. You can also meditate on Bible verses you plan to use that day and the publications you plan to offer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:1:6-55:1:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:6</a>) Think about the people in the territory and what you can say that will interest them.

If you take notes during public talks, assemblies, and conventions, take the time to review them. As you do, ask yourself, ‘What have I learned from God’s Word and from his organization?’ You can also meditate on the information in each month’s issues of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines and in the latest convention releases. When you read the <em>Yearbook</em><em>, </em>pause after reading an experience, think about it, and let it touch your heart. When you read our publications, you may want to underline the main thoughts or make notes in the margin. This will help you when you are preparing for a return visit, a shepherding call, or a talk. Most important, when you stop and meditate on what you read, you allow time for the material to reach your heart and time for prayer to thank Jehovah for the good things you are learning.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:2:1-58:2:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:3:12-58:3:12" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 3:12</a>) Jesus warned that if we do not hear, or accept, God’s Word “with a fine and good heart,” we will not “retain” it.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">MANY people believe that their actions do not matter to God. They think that God does not really care about what happens to them. For example, after a very violent storm destroyed a large part of the Philippines in November 2013, the mayor of one large city said: “God must have been somewhere else.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Other people think that God cannot see what they are doing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:26:10-23:26:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/64:1:11-64:1:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3 John 11</a>) Some people in the apostle Paul’s time thought the same way. He said about them: “They did not see fit to acknowledge God.” They were unrighteous, wicked, greedy, and bad.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:28-45:1:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 1:28, 29</a>.</p>

But do we believe that Jehovah is interested <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>in us? Do we see his helping hand in our life? In the Bible, God’s “hand” often refers to his applied power. He uses his power to help his servants and to defeat his enemies. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:26:8-5:26:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 26:8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus said that some people would “see God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:8-40:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:8</a>) Are we among those people? How can we “see God”? Let us learn from Bible examples of those who saw God’s hand in their life and of those who did not see it. We will also learn how faith helps us to see God’s hand.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why did Israel’s enemies refuse to see God’s hand?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In the past, many people had the opportunity to see and hear how God helped Israel. Jehovah used miracles to free his people from Egypt and to defeat many kings in the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:9:3-6:9:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joshua 9:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:9:9-6:9:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) Even though other kings heard and saw how Jehovah saved his people, “they formed an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:9:1-6:9:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 9:1, 2</a>) When they fought against Israel, those kings had the opportunity to see God’s hand. As a result of Jehovah’s great power, “the sun stood still and the moon did not move until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:10:13-6:10:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joshua 10:13</a>) But Jehovah allowed the hearts of Israel’s enemies “to become stubborn,” so that they fought against Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:11:20-6:11:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joshua 11:20</a>) Israel’s enemies were defeated because they refused to admit that Jehovah was fighting for his people.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Later, wicked King Ahab had the opportunity to see God’s hand several times. Elijah told him: “There will be no dew or rain except by my word!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:1-11:17:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:1</a>) This was only possible because of God’s hand, but Ahab refused to believe that. Later, Elijah prayed to Jehovah, and God answered him by sending fire from heaven. Ahab saw that. Then, Elijah told Ahab that Jehovah would end the drought and send a downpour of rain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:22-11:18:45" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:22-45</a>) Ahab saw all these miracles and still refused to believe that he had seen Jehovah’s power. What do we learn from these examples? We must look for God’s hand in our life.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The Gibeonites were very different from the nations around them. They saw God’s hand. Instead of fighting the Israelites, the Gibeonites wanted to make peace with them. Why? They said that it was because they had heard about Jehovah and all he had done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:9:3-6:9:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Joshua 9:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:9:9-6:9:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) It was wise of them to recognize that Jehovah was fighting for Israel.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Rahab also saw Jehovah’s hand. She was not an Israelite, but she had heard about how Jehovah freed his people from Egypt. When two Israelite spies came to her, she told them: “I do know that Jehovah will give you the land.” Rahab believed that Jehovah could save her and her family. She showed her faith in Jehovah even though she knew that doing so was dangerous.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:2:9-6:2:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Joshua 2:9-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:4:23-6:4:24" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 4:23, 24</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Unlike wicked King Ahab, some of the Israelites who saw the fire coming from heaven in response to Elijah’s prayer recognized that God had done that.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How can we see Jehovah and his hand today?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We have considered good and bad examples that help us to understand what it means to “see God” or to see God’s hand.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:53:2-19:53:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 53:2</a>) For example, while preaching on a small island in the Philippines, Allan met a woman who started to cry. He says, “Just that morning, she prayed to Jehovah that his Witnesses would find her.” As a teenager, she studied the Bible with the Witnesses, but when she got married and moved to the island, she did not continue her study. God answered her prayer so quickly that it touched her heart. In less than a year, she dedicated her life to Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jehovah also helps his servants to endure personal difficulties. This happened to Amy. She was assigned to help build a Kingdom Hall and a missionary home on a small island in the Pacific Ocean. The culture was different, there was often no electricity or water, the streets were flooded, she missed her family, and she was living in a small hotel room. One day, she yelled at a sister she was working with. She felt very bad about what she had done. When she went back to her dark room, she prayed to Jehovah and asked for help. Then, when the electricity came back on, she read an article in the <em>Watchtower </em>about a Gilead graduation. The article discussed the same difficulties she had to endure. She says: “I felt that Jehovah was speaking to me that night.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Sometimes, we may not see God’s hand in our life. Why? When we have a lot of problems, we may forget that Jehovah has helped us many times before. This happened to Elijah. He was courageous, but when Queen Jezebel wanted to kill him, he was scared. For a moment, he forgot how Jehovah had helped him earlier. The Bible says that Elijah wanted to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:19:1-11:19:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Kings 19:1-4</a>) Where could he find help and courage?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>How can you see Jehovah’s hand in your life? Let us consider five examples. First, you may feel that Jehovah helped you to find the truth. Second, you may remember going to a Christian meeting, hearing a talk, and saying, “That was just what I needed!” Third, perhaps you have seen how Jehovah answered one of your prayers. Fourth, maybe you wanted to do more for Jehovah and you saw how he helped you to reach that goal. Fifth, maybe you left your job because it took time away from your service to Jehovah and then you saw God fulfill his promise: “I will never abandon you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>) When we have a strong relationship with Jehovah, we can easily see his hand in our life.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Sarah, a sister from Kenya, says: “I prayed about a student who I felt did not appreciate her Bible study. I asked Jehovah if I should stop the study. Immediately after I said ‘Amen,’ my phone rang. The Bible student called to ask if she could attend the meeting with me! I was awestruck!” If we look for what God is doing for us, we will see his helping hand. Rhonna, a sister who lives in Asia, says that it takes time to see how Jehovah helps us in our life. “But once you do,” she adds, “it’s amazing to discover how much interest he has in us!”</p>

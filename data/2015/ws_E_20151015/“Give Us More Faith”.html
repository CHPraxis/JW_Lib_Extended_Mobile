<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">HAVE you ever asked yourself, ‘Will Jehovah want to save me during the great tribulation?’ The apostle Paul said that one very important quality we need in order to survive is faith. He said: “Without faith it is impossible to please God well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) That might sound simple, but the truth is that “faith is not a possession of all people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:3:2-53:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>) Those two scriptures help us understand how important it is to strengthen our faith.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter talked about a “tested” faith. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:7-60:1:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The great tribulation is very near, and we want to be “the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:39-58:10:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:39</a>) So we need to work hard to strengthen our faith. We want to be among those who are rewarded when Jesus Christ, our King, is revealed. So, like the man who begged Jesus for more faith, we too may say: “Help me out where I need faith!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:9:24-41:9:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 9:24</a>) Or, like the apostles, we may also say: “Give us more faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 17:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Elijah show that he had strong faith in Jehovah, and what should we ask ourselves?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>An example from the Bible is the prophet Elijah. As you meditate on his example, notice five situations in which he showed this strong trust in Jehovah. (1) When Elijah told King Ahab that Jehovah would bring a drought, he confidently declared: “As surely as Jehovah the God of Israel whom I serve is living, during these years there will be no dew or rain.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:1-11:17:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:1</a>) (2) Elijah believed that Jehovah would give him and others what they needed during the drought. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:4-11:17:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:13-11:17:14" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) (3) Elijah was also sure that Jehovah could resurrect a widow’s son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:21-11:17:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:21</a>) (4) He had no doubt that Jehovah’s fire would consume his sacrifice on Mount Carmel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:24-11:18:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:37-11:18:37" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 37</a>) (5) Even before any rain had fallen, Elijah said with confidence to Ahab: “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy downpour.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:41-11:18:41" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:41</a>) So after considering these experiences, we can ask ourselves, ‘Is my faith as strong as Elijah’s?’</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Since we cannot build our faith on our own, we need to ask God for holy spirit. Why? Because faith is a part of the fruitage of the holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22</a>) We are wise when we follow Jesus’ counsel to pray for more holy spirit. Jesus promised that Jehovah will “give holy spirit to those asking him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Describe how we can keep our faith strong.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Once we have strong faith in God, we must maintain it. We can compare faith to a fire. When we start a fire, the flames can be very strong. However, if we do not add wood to the fire, it will eventually burn out and turn into cold ashes. But if we regularly add wood to the fire, we can keep it burning. It is the same with our faith. If we continue to read and study God’s Word daily, our love for the Bible and Jehovah will grow. As a result, we will maintain and strengthen our faith.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What will help you to build and maintain your faith?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>You must not be satisfied with only the things you learned before your baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:1-58:6:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:1, 2</a>) For example, studying Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled will help you to build and maintain your faith. You can also use God’s Word to see whether your faith is really strong.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:25;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:24-59:2:24" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> <strong>2:24,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> <strong>26</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>How is our faith strengthened by (a) good friends? (b) congregation meetings? (c) preaching?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul said that Christians can “have an interchange of encouragement by one another’s faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:12-45:1:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 1:12</a>) What does that mean? When we spend time with our brothers and sisters, we can strengthen one another’s faith. This is especially true when we spend time with those who have a “tested” faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:3-59:1:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">James 1:3</a>) Bad friends destroy our faith, but good friends build it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) That is why we are counseled to attend the meetings regularly. There, we can keep on “encouraging one another.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In addition, the instruction we receive at the meetings strengthens our faith. The Bible says that “faith follows the thing heard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 10:17</a>) So ask yourself, ‘Are Christian meetings a regular part of my life?’</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>We also strengthen our faith when we preach and teach the good news of the Bible to others. Like the early Christians, we learn to trust in Jehovah and speak boldly in any situation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:17-44:4:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 4:17-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:46-44:13:46" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 13:46</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Our faith in Jehovah grows when we see how he helps us and how he answers our prayers. That is what happened to Caleb and Joshua. They showed faith in Jehovah when they spied out the Promised Land. As time passed, their faith became stronger each time they saw how Jehovah helped them. Joshua could confidently tell the Israelites: “Not one word <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed.” He later said: “Therefore, fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness.” Then he added: “As for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:24:14-6:24:15" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 24:14, 15</a>) When we trust in Jehovah and see how he helps us personally, our faith will become stronger.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Preaching is an excellent way to demonstrate our faith. Why? Because when we preach, we show that we believe that the end is near and that “it will not be late!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:3</a>) To know whether our faith is strong, we can ask ourselves: ‘How important is preaching to me? Am I doing all that I can to tell others about God? Do I look for ways to do more in my service to Jehovah?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) Let us show the strength of our faith by making “public declaration for salvation,” that is, by preaching the good news.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:10-45:10:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 10:10</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

When we are sick, discouraged, depressed, poor, or have other problems, we must have faith that Jehovah and Jesus will “help us at the right time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:16-58:4:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:16</a>) We show faith in Jehovah when we ask him for help. Jesus said that we can ask Jehovah to give us “bread according to our daily needs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:3-42:11:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 11:3</a>) Accounts in the Bible prove that Jehovah can give us anything we need. For example, during a severe drought in Israel, Jehovah gave food and water to Elijah. The Bible says that “the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the stream.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:3-11:17:6" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:3-6</a>) We have faith that Jehovah can also give us what we need.</p>

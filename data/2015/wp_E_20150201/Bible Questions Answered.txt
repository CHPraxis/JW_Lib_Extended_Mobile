BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Will we ever have one government for the whole world?






How could a world government unite people of all nations? Isaiah 32:1, 17; 54:13





Imagine how a world government could benefit mankind. Today many people suffer because they are so poor, while others are very rich. But a compassionate world government could make sure that all have what they need. Do you think humans will ever create such a government?—Read Jeremiah 10:23.
Throughout history, governments have failed in many ways to care for their subjects, especially the poor. Some governments are cruel. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) But Almighty God has promised to provide a government that will replace all others. Its Ruler will really take care of people.—Read Isaiah 11:4; Daniel 2:44.



What will God’s Kingdom achieve?

Jehovah God has chosen an ideal world Ruler—his Son, Jesus. (Luke 1:31-33) As a man on earth, Jesus was interested in helping people. As King, he will unite people of all nations and relieve people of all suffering.—Read Psalm 72:8, 12-14.
Will everyone accept Jesus as Ruler? No. But Jehovah is patient. (2 Peter 3:9) He is giving people the opportunity to accept Jesus as Ruler. Soon, Jesus will rid the earth of bad people and will establish peace and security worldwide.—Read Micah 4:3, 4.

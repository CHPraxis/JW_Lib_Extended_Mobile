<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Why is it important for us to consider this matter of giving thanks? As foretold, people in these last days have become increasingly unthankful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:2-55:3:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:2</a>) Many take their blessings for granted. Influenced by the commercial world and its advertising, millions of people strive to obtain more instead of being content with what they have. We too can be affected by this unappreciative spirit. Like the ancient Israelites, we could become ungrateful and lose appreciation for <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>our precious relationship with Jehovah and for the blessings that we have received from him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:106:7-19:106:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 106:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:106:11-19:106:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11-13</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>If we are to cultivate a grateful heart and maintain it, we must acknowledge and meditate appreciatively on our blessings from Jehovah and carefully consider his acts of loyal love. When the psalmist did so, he was awed by the many wonderful things that Jehovah had done.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:5-19:40:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 40:5;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:107:43-19:107:43" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> <strong>107:43</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We can learn much from the apostle Paul about cultivating gratitude. Evidently, he meditated on his blessings, for he frequently expressed heartfelt thanks. Paul well knew that he had been “a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.” Hence, he gave thanks that despite his past sinful conduct, God and Christ had shown him mercy and had entrusted him with a ministry. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:12-54:1:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:12-14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul also deeply appreciated his fellow Christians and often thanked Jehovah for their fine qualities and faithful service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:3-50:1:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Phil. 1:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:7-50:1:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:1:2-52:1:3" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 1:2, 3</a>) And when Paul faced trialsome situations, he was quick to thank Jehovah for the timely support that he received from his spiritual brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:28:15-44:28:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 28:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:5-47:7:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 7:5-7</a>) It is not surprising, therefore, that Paul’s writings encourage Christians: “Show yourselves thankful . . . , encouraging one another with psalms, praises to God, spiritual songs sung with gratitude.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:15-51:3:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 3:15-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How can we imitate Paul’s fine example in cultivating and expressing gratitude? Like Paul, we need to meditate on what Jehovah has done for us personally. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:116:12-19:116:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>) If you were asked, ‘What blessings from Jehovah are you grateful for?’ how would you answer? Would you include your precious relationship with Jehovah? Or the forgiveness that you receive because of your faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice? Would you relate the names of brothers and sisters who have stood by you during various difficult trials? Of course, your beloved marriage mate or your precious children would not escape your mention. Taking time to meditate on such beautiful blessings from your loving Father, Jehovah, will fill your heart with gratitude and will move you to give thanks every day.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:92:1-19:92:2" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 92:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When we have our blessings firmly fixed in mind and heart, we are ready to pray to Jehovah and offer thanksgiving.

We, <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>however, know that Jehovah is pleased when we express thanks for what we have. The Bible contains numerous heartwarming prayers of thanksgiving, including those offered by Hannah and Hezekiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:2:1-9:2:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:38:9-23:38:20" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Isa. 38:9-20</a>) So imitate those faithful servants who showed a grateful spirit.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Why should we remain alert to the danger of losing our appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness? Because we have inherited a tendency to be unthankful. Consider: Our original parents, Adam and Eve, were placed in a paradise garden. All their needs were filled, and they had the prospect of living forever in peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) But they did not appreciate their blessings. They greedily desired more. As a result, they lost everything.

We could begin to take our friendship with him for granted. We might lose appreciation for the privilege that we have to be part of our worldwide brotherhood. We could become absorbed in things of this world that will soon pass away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) To avoid that downward spiral, we want to meditate on our blessings and regularly thank Jehovah for the privilege we have of being his people.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 27:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

We may feel overwhelmed if we are suddenly confronted with life-altering circumstances, such as the unfaithfulness of a marriage mate, a life-threatening illness, the death of a loved one, or the devastating effects of a natural disaster.

I felt that I had lost everything, and I was very scared.” What has helped Kyung-sook to cope? She says: “Every night before going to bed, I go to the rooftop of our home and pray out loud about five things that I am grateful for from that day. Then I feel reassured, and I am moved to express my love for Jehovah.” How has Kyung-sook benefited from these nightly prayers?

I felt a sense of relief and thereafter started to thank Jehovah regularly for such happy memories. Gratefulness has made a big difference in my outlook.

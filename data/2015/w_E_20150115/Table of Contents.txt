STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Give Thanks to Jehovah and Be Blessed
We can cultivate and maintain gratitude by meditating on our blessings and thanking Jehovah for them. Having a grateful heart will help us to fight unthankfulness and to cope with trials. Our yeartext for 2015 will remind us of this throughout the coming year.

▪  Why We Observe the Lord’s Evening Meal
This article makes clear why we should commemorate Jesus’ death. It explains what the bread and wine at the Memorial represent and shows how a person knows whether he or she should partake of these emblems. This study will also help us to see how we personally can prepare for the Lord’s Evening Meal.

▪  Build a Strong and Happy Marriage
▪  Let Jehovah Fortify and Safeguard Your Marriage
Married couples are contending with increasing pressures and temptations. Yet, with Jehovah’s help, it is possible to have a strong and happy marriage. The first article will discuss five spiritual building blocks for a strong and lasting marriage and the mortar that can be used to bind them together. The second article will examine how to fortify the spiritual defenses of a marriage.

▪  Is Unfailing Love Possible?
What is true love between a man and a woman like? Is enduring love possible? How is such love expressed? Learn what the Song of Solomon teaches us about unfailing love.

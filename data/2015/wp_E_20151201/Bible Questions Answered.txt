BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Can we know the truth about God?






Why does God want us to know the truth? Read John 17:3





God has communicated with mankind. He used his holy spirit, or active force, to put his thoughts into the minds of Bible writers. (2 Peter 1:20, 21) We can come to know the truth about God by reading the Bible.—Read John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16.
In the Bible, God reveals many things about himself. He makes known why he created human life, what he will do for mankind, and how he wants us to live. (Acts 17:24-27) Jehovah God wants us to know the truth about him.—Read 1 Timothy 2:3, 4.



Why does God welcome lovers of truth?

Jehovah is the God of truth, and he sent his Son, Jesus, to teach mankind the truth. Therefore, lovers of truth are attracted to Jesus. (John 18:37) God wants such people as his worshippers.—Read John 4:23, 24.
Satan the Devil has prevented many people from knowing God by spreading teachings about God that are not true. (2 Corinthians 4:3, 4) People who do not love what is good are attracted to such false teachings. (Romans 1:25) But millions of sincere people are finding the truth about God by studying the Bible.—Read Acts 17:11.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God has communicated with mankind. He used his holy spirit, or active force, to put his thoughts into the minds of Bible writers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>) We can come to know the truth about God by reading the Bible.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:17;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong>2 Timothy 3:16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Bible, God reveals many things about himself. He makes known why he created human life, what he will do for mankind, and how he wants us to live.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah is the God of truth, and he sent his Son, Jesus, to teach mankind the truth. Therefore, lovers of truth are attracted to Jesus.

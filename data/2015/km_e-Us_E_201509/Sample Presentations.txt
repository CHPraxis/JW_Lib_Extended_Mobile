The Watchtower October 1

“We’re showing everyone in the neighborhood this interesting issue of The Watchtower. [Show the cover.] Some people think that prayer is just a waste of time, that no one is listening. Others believe that God hears their prayers. What’s your opinion? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says about prayer. [Read Isaiah 30:19.] This magazine provides evidence that God hears and answers prayers that are made in the right way and for the right things.”



Awake! October

“We are making brief visits on our neighbors because many wonder why God allows suffering. Do you think it is disrespectful to question God about such things? [Allow for response.] The righteous man Job expressed a desire to question God. [Read Job 23:3-5.] This magazine considers three questions that many people would like to ask God, if given the chance, and the satisfying answers that the Bible provides.”

Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Witnessing in Business Territory




Why Important: Since many people work long hours, often the best way to reach them with the Kingdom message is by witnessing to them at their workplace. Witnessing in business territory can be enjoyable and productive because there are no not-at-homes and workers tend to be polite to those they view as potential customers. In order to be effective, publishers must use good judgment and be exemplary in their dress and grooming. (2 Cor. 6:3) Therefore, the service overseer should carefully monitor how often business territories are worked and by whom.



How to Do It:
           Prepare a presentation that is brief. If we take too much of the worker’s time, we may not be given opportunities to speak to him in the future.

            Choose a time to visit when the businesses are less busy, such as when they first open.

            Endeavor to speak first with the person in charge. Be warm and friendly. You might say, “We are visiting people briefly at their workplace because it is difficult to find them at home.” Give him a brief presentation, and offer a tract, the magazines, or another piece of literature. So that we will not be confused with salesmen, it is best not to mention the donation arrangement unless we are asked how our work is financed.

            If the person in charge is friendly, ask for permission to speak briefly to the other workers. At some businesses, it may be better to ask if you can leave some reading material in the break room.

            Use good judgment, and be flexible. For example, if a worker is talking to a customer or is busy, wait until he is free before approaching him.




Try This During the Month:
            During your next Family Worship evening, practice a brief presentation you might use if you work in business territory.

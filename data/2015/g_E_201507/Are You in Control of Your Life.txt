Are You in Control of Your Life?




WHEN you were younger, what were your life goals? Perhaps you wanted to marry, perfect a certain skill, or pursue an exciting career. But life does not always turn out the way we plan. Unexpected challenges can throw life completely off course. That is what happened to Anja, Delina, and Gregory.





Anja, in Germany, was diagnosed with cancer at age 21, and she is now almost completely housebound.

Delina, in the United States, suffers from a neuromuscular disorder called dystonia. In addition, she cares for three disabled siblings.

Gregory, in Canada, copes with a crippling anxiety disorder.


Despite their circumstances, Anja, Delina, and Gregory have been able to take control of their lives. How?
A Bible proverb states: “If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be meager.” (Proverbs 24:10, footnote) The implication is clear: Attitude makes a difference. People who succumb to negativity relinquish the little control they still have, while those with a positive mind-set often summon the strength to put themselves back in the driver’s seat.
Consider how that proved true for Anja, Delina, and Gregory.

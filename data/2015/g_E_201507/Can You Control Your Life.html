<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THERE is a saying, Life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well. Today, no one has been dealt a perfect set of circumstances. Often the secret to gaining control is learning both to accept those circumstances and to work within the limitations that they impose. If you can reclaim some control of your life despite unfortunate circumstances, that is good. If your circumstances eventually improve, that is better. But the best is yet to come.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible promises a time when all people will be able to have a satisfying measure of control over their life. They will be able to live to their full potential, uninhibited by frustrating circumstances, daily pressures, and negative feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21, 22</a>) The Bible refers to this as “the real life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:19</a>.</p>

They will not build for someone else to inhabit, nor will they plant for others to eat. For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21, 22</a>.</p>

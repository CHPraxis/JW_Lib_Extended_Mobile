<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">Anja, in Germany, was diagnosed with cancer at age 21, and she is now almost completely housebound.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Despite their circumstances, Anja, Delina, and Gregory have been able to take control of their lives. How?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A Bible proverb states: “If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be meager.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>, footnote) The implication is clear: <em>Attitude makes a difference. </em>People who succumb to negativity relinquish the little control they still have, while those with a positive mind-set often summon the strength to put themselves back in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Consider how that proved true for Anja, Delina, and Gregory.</p>

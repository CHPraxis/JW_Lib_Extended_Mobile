<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In 2013, archaeologists uncovered a massive Canaanite wine cellar that dates back some 3,700 years. The cellar contained 40 large jars that could store the equivalent of 3,000 modern bottles of wine. An archaeologist who analyzed residue on the jars noted that the Canaanites were careful winemakers. He stated: “This wine’s recipe was strictly followed in each and every jar.”</p>

If growth continues at this rate, some experts say, the country will experience even greater shortages of water, energy, and food.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">More than 100 bronze coins with the inscription “Year Four” were discovered near a highway in Israel. The date points to the fourth year of the Jewish revolt against the Romans (69-70 C.E.)​—the revolt that led to Jerusalem’s destruction. “Evidently someone here feared the end was approaching​—perhaps he could see the advancing Roman army,” says Pablo Betzer, an excavation director. “He hid his property in the hope of collecting it later.”</p>

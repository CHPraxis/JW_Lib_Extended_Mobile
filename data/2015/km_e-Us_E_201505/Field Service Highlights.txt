Field Service Highlights




The last convention for the 2014 calendar year in the United States branch territory was held during November. The total peak attendance for all 191 conventions was 1,826,267, with 14,039 baptized! We rejoiced to see so many gathering together to “worship the Father with spirit and truth.”—John 4:23, 24.

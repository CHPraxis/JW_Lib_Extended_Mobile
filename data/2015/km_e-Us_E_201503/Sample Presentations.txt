The Watchtower April 1

“We’re giving this tract to everyone in the area today. [Hand the householder the tract How Do You View the Bible? and ask him the questions on the front. Show him the Bible’s answer from 2 Timothy 3:16, and encourage him to read the tract when he has time.] Many people are not aware that the Bible gives satisfying answers to questions such as these. [Show the opening questions in the first article of the Watchtower.] This magazine explains how you can find the answers in your own Bible.”



Awake! April

“We are making brief visits today because many people are concerned about the changes they see in families. In years past, parents were in charge, but now, in some households it seems that the children are. Do you think parents today discipline their children as they should? [Allow for response.] According to the Bible, discipline is important. [Read Proverbs 29:17.] This magazine discusses the Bible’s balanced instructions on disciplining children.”

▪ Literature offer for March and April: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. May and June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? or Would You Like to Know the Truth?
▪ The Memorial will be held on Friday, April 3, 2015. If your congregation normally has a meeting on Friday, it should be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If the Service Meeting must be canceled, the coordinator of the body of elders may make adjustments to the schedule so that parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation are considered during the month.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning on Friday, May 8, 2015. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on this day. Also, there will be no arrangement for tours on the day of the Memorial, Friday, April 3, 2015.
▪ Since May has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I GREW up in a very religious Catholic family that wanted me to become a priest. So when I was 12 years old, I took three courses in which I was instructed by different priests. Then, in 1990, when I was 14, I was invited to one of the best seminaries in the country.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I progressed rapidly and was told that if I continued to apply myself, I could become a bishop. However, I became disillusioned. Instead of studying the Bible, we studied human philosophy. Also, the priests were very immoral. When I became a target of their sexual harassment, I wanted to quit serving God.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At that time, a missionary couple called on the seminary accountant and gave him the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>I borrowed it and read it from cover to cover. I said to myself, ‘This is what I’m looking <span id="page171" class="pageNum" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>for.’ I left the seminary, started studying with the Witnesses, and began attending meetings. Eight months later, in July of 1991, I was baptized. I began regular pioneering and later married a pioneer sister named María. Since 2006, we have served as special pioneers. Instead of giving up on serving God, I now love helping truth-hungry people to become his true worshippers.</p>

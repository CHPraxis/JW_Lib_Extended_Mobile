“Give Thanks to Jehovah, for He Is Good.”—Psalm 106:1




After being delivered from Pharaoh and his armies at the Red Sea, the Israelites had every reason to give thanks to Jehovah. We too can gladly give thanks to Jehovah. True, when we undergo trialsome circumstances, we can easily become discouraged. At such times, we can be comforted and strengthened by reflecting on our blessings.
Among our most cherished blessings is our sure hope of deliverance from everything that causes us pain and distress. Whatever hardships may come our way, we know that Jehovah will not abandon us. Our loving Shepherd provides everything we need to serve him faithfully. He never fails to be a “refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress.” (Ps. 46:1) Our keeping focused on such blessings will help us cope with even the most grievous ordeals. Throughout the coming year, may we reflect joyfully on our blessings and be moved to “give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.”—Ps. 106:1.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even though the Internet is still not widely available in <strong>Cuba, </strong>it is now possible to connect to it at shops that a telephone company has opened. The cost, however, is very high. Therefore, to help the brothers benefit from jw.org, the branch encouraged congregations to arrange for one publisher to download publications, recordings, and videos from the Web site and then share them with other Witnesses in local congregations. This arrangement is working well.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Teona, aged 10, and her eight-year-old sister, Tamuna, live in the <strong>Republic of Georgia. </strong>The girls wanted a cell phone. To help them buy one, their grandmother promised to give them some of her pension money each month. Sadly, the grandmother died suddenly. Nevertheless, the family gave her last pension payment to the girls so that they could buy the phone they wanted. After thinking about it, the girls wrote this to their congregation: “We know that in two weeks construction of our new Kingdom Hall will begin in our village of T’erjola. Our grandmother really wanted to help with this work, so we have both decided to give Grandmother’s last full pension payment to the congregation instead of buying our cell phone. Please build us a nice Kingdom Hall!”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">On January 17, 2014, in Dili, <strong>Timor-Leste, </strong>Geoffrey Jackson of the Governing Body released the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>in Tetum, the most widely spoken language in the country. Previously, the only copies of the Greek Scriptures in Tetum were printed and distributed by the Catholic Church, which refused to sell them to Jehovah’s Witnesses or people suspected of studying with the Witnesses. However, the Catholic translation had many inaccuracies, omissions, archaic words, and printing errors. In contrast, regarding the <em>New World Translation, </em>Darren, a missionary in Timor-Leste, stated: “Many Timorese <span id="page40" class="pageNum" data-no="40" data-before-text="40"></span>who read the <em>New World Translation </em>are impressed by its accuracy, and they immediately request copies. They find it easy to read, and they appreciate the large text, especially since many homes have poor lighting. Many who have obtained a copy are now studying the Bible.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In January 2014, the translation work for the Romany language, which is spoken in <strong>Macedonia, </strong>reached a milestone. A permanent translation team was formed, and approval was given to produce publications in this language not only in Roman script but also in Cyrillic. This is a great help to the Romany-speaking people, who are more accustomed to Cyrillic, which is the official script in Macedonia.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Many of the Romany-speaking population are touched by the fact that Jehovah’s organization provides literature in their language. One sister said: “As <span id="page41" class="pageNum" data-no="41" data-before-text="41"></span>someone who speaks Romany, I often experience that people of other races look down on me, so I am very grateful to Jehovah that he considers me worthy of receiving literature in my own language. This draws me even closer to him.”</p>

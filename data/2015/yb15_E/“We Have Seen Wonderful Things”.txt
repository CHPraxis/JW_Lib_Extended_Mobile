“We Have Seen Wonderful Things”









A blind brother is baptized




ON ONE occasion when Jesus healed a paralyzed man, “all were seized with amazement, and they began to glorify God, and they became filled with awe, saying: ‘We have seen wonderful things today!’” (Luke 5:25, 26) What Jehovah God is accomplishing today by means of his beloved Son, the faithful and discreet slave, and his faithful worshippers throughout the earth gives us even greater reason to echo the words: “We have seen wonderful things.”

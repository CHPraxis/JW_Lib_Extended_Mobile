Rapid Progress at Warwick









THERE is great excitement and much activity at the construction site of the future world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Warwick, New York. Hundreds of brothers and sisters have gone to great lengths to work on the project. Yet, many of them say, “We wouldn’t trade working here for anything.” Let us see what is happening at Warwick.








What is it like to work at Warwick?





“Warwick has become much more than just buildings. Jehovah is unifying the various construction teams and helping us to rethink how we design and plan major construction projects.”—Enrique Ford.






“Psalm 127:1 says: ‘Unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.’ Those words confirm that the true success of this project will be due to Jehovah’s blessing.”—Troy Snyder.






“This has been the most faith-strengthening experience of my life.”—Richard Devine.

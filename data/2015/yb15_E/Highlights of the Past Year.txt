Highlights of the Past Year




Jehovah God inspired the prophet Isaiah to foretell: “Instead of the copper I will bring in gold, and instead of the iron I will bring in silver, instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.” (Isa. 60:17) During the past year, we have seen clear evidence that this prophecy continues to be fulfilled. Just as replacing an inferior material with a superior one denotes improvement, Jehovah’s Witnesses have experienced improvements in their organizational arrangements during this time of the end.—Matt. 24:3.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">ABOUT a month after Trujillo’s assassination in 1961, I was baptized while I was studying law at a university. My father wanted me to enter the legal profession, but I could see the superiority of divine education. So, in spite of pressure from my father, I left the university. Shortly afterward, I was appointed as a special pioneer.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">One of my assignments was in La Vega, a longtime Catholic stronghold. During my time there, no one accepted the truth. When I gave public talks, the only person in the audience was my pioneer partner. Yet, Jehovah sustained me through personal Bible study, attendance at assemblies, and fervent prayers. In prayer, I asked Jehovah if there would <em>ever </em>be a congregation in La Vega. I am <span id="page161" class="pageNum" data-no="161" data-before-text="161"></span>happy to report that there are now 6 Kingdom Halls, 14 congregations, and over 800 Kingdom publishers there.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">I married my wife, Ángela, in 1965, and in 1981 we were invited to Bethel. When I was baptized, there were only 681 publishers in the country. Now we have more than 36,000 publishers, and many thousands gather at our various assemblies. Looking back, I am amazed to see how Jehovah has opened so many hearts to Bible truths.</p>

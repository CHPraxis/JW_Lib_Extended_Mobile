STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Train Your Child to Serve Jehovah
▪  Train Your Teenager to Serve Jehovah
Jehovah has entrusted parents with a precious yet sobering assignment—that of training their children to serve him. These two articles show how parents can fulfill that responsibility by imitating Jesus and three of his qualities—love, humility, and insight.

▪  Jehovah Is the God of Love
▪  Do You “Love Your Neighbor as Yourself”?
The first of these two articles makes it clear that Jehovah is a God of love. It also explains how God has manifested his love for mankind. The second article discusses how Jehovah’s servants show love for neighbor.

▪  One Hundred Years Under Kingdom Rulership!
This article focuses on what has been done to declare the good news during the past 100 years of Kingdom rulership. Learn about some tools and innovative methods used in our disciple-making work. Also consider the effective training given to Kingdom publishers throughout the years.

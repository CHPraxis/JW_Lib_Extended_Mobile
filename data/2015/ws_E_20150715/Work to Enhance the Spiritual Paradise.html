<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>What can the word “footstool” refer to in the Hebrew Scriptures?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD said: “The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:66:1-23:66:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 66:1</a>) God was also speaking about his “footstool” when he said: “I will glorify the place for my feet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:13-23:60:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:13</a>) How does he glorify his footstool, or make it beautiful? And what does this mean for those living on his footstool, the earth?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word “footstool” is also used to describe the ancient temple in Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:2-13:28:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:132:7-19:132:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Psalm 132:7</a>) The temple was very beautiful to Jehovah because it was the center of true worship. And it was used to glorify Jehovah on the earth.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What is the center of true worship today, and when did it begin to exist?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>What is the center of true worship today? It is not a <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>building like the temple. It is a spiritual temple, and it glorifies Jehovah more than any building ever could. What is the spiritual temple? It is God’s arrangement that allows humans to become his friends and to worship him. This arrangement is only possible because of Jesus’ ransom. This arrangement began in the year 29 when Jesus was baptized and anointed as High Priest of Jehovah’s spiritual temple.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:11-58:9:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We are very grateful for God’s arrangement of true worship. We show our gratitude by telling others about Jehovah’s name and his wonderful gift of the ransom. We are excited that there are more than eight million true Christians praising Jehovah each day! While many religious people wrongly think that they will praise God in heaven after they have died, Jehovah’s people know how important it is to praise him <strong>here and now.</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When we praise Jehovah, we imitate the example of faithful servants of God described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:99:1-19:99:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 99:1-3,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:99:5-19:99:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>5</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>Faithful men such as Moses, Aaron, and Samuel fully supported God’s arrangement for true worship in the past. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:99:6-19:99:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 99:6, 7</a>) Today, before the anointed on earth begin serving as priests with Jesus in heaven, they faithfully serve Jehovah in the earthly part of the spiritual temple. Millions of “other sheep” loyally assist them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) Both groups unitedly worship Jehovah. However, we should ask ourselves a personal question, ‘Am I fully supporting Jehovah’s arrangement for true worship?’</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO SERVE AT GOD’S SPIRITUAL TEMPLE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What problem developed in the early Christian congregation, and what happened by the year 1919?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Less than 100 years after the Christian congregation was formed, an apostasy developed as foretold. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:28-44:20:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 20:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:3-53:2:4" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4</a>) After that time, it became more and more difficult to identify God’s true worshippers. Hundreds of years passed before Jehovah used Jesus to identify who really were serving God at His spiritual temple.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>By the year 1919, those approved by God and serving at his spiritual temple were clearly identified. They had made adjustments so that their worship would be even more acceptable to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:4:2-23:4:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 4:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:1-39:3:4" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Malachi 3:1-4</a>) So a vision the apostle Paul saw hundreds of years earlier began to be fulfilled.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>What is the “paradise” that Paul saw in a vision?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Paul’s vision is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:12:1-47:12:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 12:1-4</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>In that vision, Jehovah showed Paul something that would exist in the future. What is the “paradise” that Paul saw? First, it can refer to the literal Paradise soon to come on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>) Second, it can refer to the perfect spiritual paradise in the new world. And third, it can refer to the wonderful conditions in heaven in “the paradise of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:2:7-66:2:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 2:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Why, though, did Paul say that he had “heard words that cannot be spoken and that are not lawful for a man to say”? Because it was not the time for him to explain in detail the wonderful things that he had seen in the vision. But today Jehovah does allow us to tell others about the blessings that his people enjoy right now!</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>Why are the spiritual paradise and the spiritual temple not the same?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>We often talk about the spiritual paradise, but what is it? It is the special environment of peace that God gives to his people. So the spiritual paradise and the spiritual temple are not the same. The spiritual temple is God’s arrangement for true worship. The spiritual paradise clearly identifies those who are approved by God and who worship him at his spiritual temple.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:18-39:3:18" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Malachi 3:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What privilege do we have today?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>It is exciting to know that since 1919, Jehovah has allowed imperfect humans to cultivate, strengthen, and increase the spiritual paradise. Are you helping to do this wonderful work? Do you appreciate the privilege of working with Jehovah to bring glory to him on the earth?</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The prophet Isaiah foretold that many wonderful changes and adjustments would happen in the earthly part of God’s organization. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:17-23:60:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 60:17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Young or new Christians have only <strong>read </strong>or <strong>heard </strong>about these changes. But there are many brothers and sisters who have had the privilege of <strong>experiencing </strong>those wonderful adjustments!

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Many older ones in our congregations have experienced adjustments that have made the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization more beautiful. They remember when congregations had a congregation servant rather than a body of elders, when countries had a branch servant rather than a Branch Committee, or when the president of the Watch Tower Society gave direction rather than the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Even though all these brothers had faithful assistants, one person was basically responsible for making decisions in the congregations, at the branch offices, and at world headquarters. After 1970, adjustments were made so that groups of elders had the responsibility for making decisions rather than one individual.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Why have these adjustments benefited the organization? Because they were based on a better understanding of the Scriptures. Instead of having one person making all the decisions, the organization benefits from the good qualities of <strong>all </strong>the elders, or “gifts in men,” provided by Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:6-20:24:6" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Proverbs 24:6</a>.</p>

We enjoy offering helpful and attractive literature in our ministry. Think, too, about how we use new technology to preach the good news.

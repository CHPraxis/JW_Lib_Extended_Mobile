▪  Work to Enhance the Spiritual Paradise
Jehovah’s people enjoy a special environment of peace in the earthly part of his organization. How can we show that we are deeply grateful for being part of his arrangement for true worship, and what can we personally do to make this environment of peace stronger? This article will answer these questions.

▪  “Your Deliverance Is Getting Near”!
This article will explain some of the exciting events that will happen in the future. We will also learn why we will be able to trust in Jehovah completely during the great tribulation.

▪  Maintain Your Loyalty to God’s Kingdom
Many people in Satan’s world are loyal to their country, culture, or race. But we have promised to be loyal to Jehovah. This article will discuss why we do not take sides in the world’s conflicts and how we can train ourselves to think the way Jehovah and Jesus do.

▪  This Is Our Place of Worship
Around the world, Jehovah’s people meet for worship in Kingdom Halls and similar buildings. In this article, we will discuss Bible principles that teach us to respect these meeting places, contribute toward them, and take care of them so that we give glory to Jehovah.

Think of some examples. The Jews and the Samaritans did not speak to one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:9-43:4:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 4:9</a>) The Pharisees and the Sadducees disagreed on many things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:23:6-44:23:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 23:6-9</a>) Jews who had studied the Law thought that they were better than those who had not.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:9:11-40:9:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 9:11</a>) But Jesus did not take part in these conflicts. Although he always defended the truth about Jehovah and knew that Israel was God’s special nation, he never taught his disciples that they were better than others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:22-43:4:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 4:22</a>) Instead, he taught them to love all people.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:27-42:10:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 10:27</a>.</p>

In Eden, Satan said that Jehovah was not the best ruler for humans. Satan wanted humans to believe that his way of doing things was better than God’s. Jehovah lets us decide for ourselves whose side we want to be on. But what about you? Do you obey Jehovah because you believe that his way of doing things is better than your way? Are you convinced that only his Kingdom can solve our problems?

This was a very serious problem, because the peace of the congregation was in danger. So he asked his brothers and sisters: “Is the Christ divided?” Paul counseled them: “I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you should all speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you, but that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.” The same is true today. There should not be any divisions in the congregation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:10-46:1:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:16:17-45:16:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 16:17, 18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

In the area where she grew up, people hated Serbians. When she learned about Jehovah, she realized that he does not favor one ethnic group over another and that Satan wants people to hate one another. So she tried hard to change the way she felt. But when a war started between various ethnic groups in the area where she lived, Mirjeta started to have negative feelings about Serbians again. She did not even want to preach to them. She knew this was wrong, so she begged Jehovah to help her stop feeling this way. She also asked him to help her start pioneering. Mirjeta says: “I have found that focusing on the ministry is the best help ever. In the ministry, I try to imitate Jehovah’s loving personality, and I have seen my negative feelings melt away.”</p>

In her congregation, there are brothers and sisters from another part of Latin America. Zoila says that some of them made fun of the country she was from, its customs, and its music. She was upset, so she prayed to Jehovah to help her not to feel offended. How would we have reacted if we were in her situation? Some of our brothers and sisters are still struggling to control their emotions when they hear negative comments about the place they are from. So we would never want to say or do anything that makes one group of people seem better than another.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Be Watchful—Satan Wants to Devour You!
▪  You Can Fight Satan—And Win!
The Bible compares Satan to a roaring lion that is hungry for more victims. He is powerful, cruel, and deceptive. These articles will help us to see why we must fight against this dangerous enemy. They will also show us how we can protect ourselves from his traps.

▪  They “Saw” the Things Promised
▪  Imitate the One Who Promises Everlasting Life
Jehovah gave us the ability to imagine things that we have never seen. We can use this ability in good ways or in bad ways. In these two articles, we will discuss some people in Bible times and learn from their example how we can use our imagination to have more faith. We will also learn how our imagination can help us to imitate Jehovah’s love, kindness, wisdom, and happiness.

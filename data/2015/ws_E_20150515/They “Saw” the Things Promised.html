<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">JEHOVAH has given us a wonderful gift. It is the ability to imagine things we have not seen. This ability helps us to look forward to good things in the future and also to plan ahead and avoid problems. Jehovah knows the future, and he tells us some of the things we can look forward to. Although we cannot see them, we can imagine them and have faith that they will happen.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Of course, sometimes we imagine things that will never happen. For example, a little girl might imagine that she is riding on a butterfly. Of course, that is not possible. But Samuel’s mother, Hannah, imagined things that were possible. She kept thinking about the day when she would take her son to the tabernacle to work with the priests. This was not just a dream. It was <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>something that she had decided to do. So imagining that day gave Hannah the strength to keep her promise to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:1:22-9:1:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:22</a>) And when we imagine what Jehovah has promised to do, we are imagining things that will certainly happen.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:19-61:1:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:19-21</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob could imagine a wonderful future. Jehovah had promised them that people from all the nations would be blessed by means of their “offspring.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 22:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:26:4-1:26:4" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:28:14-1:28:14" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>God had also promised them that their family would become a large nation and would live in the beautiful Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:15:5-1:15:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 15:5-7</a>) Because Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew that Jehovah’s promises would come true, they could clearly imagine their families already living in that land. In fact, ever since Adam and Eve sinned, Jehovah has helped his loyal servants to understand how humans would one day have perfect life again.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What helped Abraham to have strong faith and be obedient?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Because he had strong faith, Abraham was obedient to Jehovah even when circumstances were very difficult. Abraham and other loyal ones could clearly imagine the things Jehovah promised, even though these promises did not come true while they were alive. The Bible says: “They saw them from a distance and welcomed them.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:8-58:11:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 11:8-13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Abraham knew that Jehovah had always kept his promises in the past, so he was sure that all of Jehovah’s promises for the future would come true as well.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Because Abraham had faith in what Jehovah had promised him, he kept on doing what Jehovah asked him to do. For example, he left his home in the city of Ur, and for the rest of his life, he did not live in any city permanently. He knew that the cities around him would not last forever because the rulers did not serve Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:24:2-6:24:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Joshua 24:2</a>) Instead, he looked forward to the time when Jehovah and his government would rule the earth forever. This government is “the city having real foundations, whose designer and builder is God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:10-58:11:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:10</a>) Abraham as well as Abel, Enoch, Noah, and others believed in the resurrection. Whenever they thought about living forever on a beautiful earth, their faith in Jehovah grew even stronger.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:15-58:11:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 11:15, 16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Abraham’s wife, Sarah, had strong faith in Jehovah’s promises. Even when she was 90 years old and still had no children, she looked forward to the time when she would have a baby. Sarah could even imagine her children becoming a large nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:11-58:11:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:11, 12</a>) How could she be so sure of that? Because Jehovah had told her husband: “I will bless her and also give you a son by her; I will bless her and she will become nations; kings of peoples will <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>come from her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:16-1:17:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 17:16</a>) Just as Jehovah promised, Sarah had a son, Isaac.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Moses also had faith in Jehovah’s promises. He was raised in Egypt as a prince. But because he loved Jehovah more than anything else, Moses did not want power and riches. He had learned about Jehovah from his Hebrew parents, who taught him that Jehovah promised to free the Hebrews from slavery and give them the Promised Land.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The Bible tells us what Moses kept thinking about: “By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:24-58:11:26" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>Why was it good for Moses to keep thinking about Jehovah’s promises?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Moses must have thought deeply about Jehovah’s promise to free the Hebrews from slavery.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>When we tell our brothers and sisters what we would like to do in the new world, we help one another to imagine this beautiful future more clearly. Of course, we do not know exactly what each of us will be doing. But when we talk about what we look forward to, we show that we have faith in what Jehovah has promised. In this way, we encourage one another to keep serving Jehovah in <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>difficult times, just as the apostle Paul and his brothers in Rome did.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Romans 1:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>When you think about the future that Jehovah has promised, you will think less about your own problems. At one time, Peter was worried and said to Jesus: “Look! We have left all things and followed you; what, then, will there be for us?” Jesus wanted Peter and the other disciples with him to think about the wonderful things they would do in the future. He told them: “When the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:27-40:19:29" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matthew 19:27-29</a>) So Peter and the other disciples could imagine themselves ruling with Jesus in heaven and helping obedient humans on earth to become perfect.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>) Moses looked forward to the reward Jehovah promised him, and this helped him to love Jehovah and be faithful.

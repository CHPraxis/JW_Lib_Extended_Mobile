There is a young brother called Alan. He is thinking about an older brother who cannot walk well and who has bad eyesight. Alan thinks of Jesus’ words: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>) So Alan asks himself, ‘What do I want others to do to me?’ He says, ‘I really want them to play ball with me!’ But this older brother cannot run and play ball.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Although Alan is still young, he tries to imagine how he would feel if he were old.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>It is not always easy to understand what other people are experiencing, especially if we have never been in their situation. For example, many of our brothers are in pain because they are sick or have been injured or because they are getting older. Some are suffering deeply because of depression or extreme anxiety or because they were abused in the past. Others are raising children alone or have family members who are not serving Jehovah. Everyone has problems, and most of those problems are different from ours. But we want to show love to others and help them. So, what can we do? Each person might need something different. So if we listen carefully and keep trying to understand how that person feels, we will know the best way to help him. Perhaps we can remind him of how Jehovah feels about his problem. Or we may be able to give him help in other ways.

He imagined how they would feel about what he might say or do. For example, a woman who had done many bad things came to Jesus. She was crying so much that her tears fell on Jesus’ feet. Jesus could see that she felt very sorry about the bad things she had done and that she had repented. He realized that if he was unkind to her, she would feel even worse.

If you are preaching and someone says that he is too busy to talk to you, how can you be kind to him?

Although we do not know the future, we too can be wise. How? Before making a decision, we can imagine how it might affect us or others. We should not be like the Israelites. They did not think about what would happen to them if they disobeyed Jehovah. And they did not think about their relationship with him and all that he had done for them. Because Moses realized this, he knew that the Israelites were going to do what was bad. He said: “They are a nation devoid of sense, and there is no understanding among them. If only they were wise! They would ponder over this. They would think about their outcome.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:31:29-5:31:30" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:28-5:32:29" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 32:28, 29</a>.</p>

When we think about things we learn from Jehovah, it is good for us.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We can learn from the example of the first woman, Eve. Jehovah had commanded Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit from “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a>) But Satan told Eve: “You certainly will not die. For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.” Eve imagined how much better her life would be if she could decide for herself what was good and what was bad. She kept thinking about this and “saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes.” What happened then? “She began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a>) As a result, “sin entered into the world and death through sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Eve should not have kept thinking about doing what was wrong!</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Of course, Eve’s sin did not involve sexual immorality. But the Bible clearly warns us not to keep imagining ourselves doing anything sexually immoral. Jesus said: “Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:28-40:5:28" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 5:28</a>) Also, Paul warned: “Do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:13:14-45:13:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 13:14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:11</a>) Jesus said that a person is foolish if he stores up many treasures for himself but does not keep Jehovah first in his life.

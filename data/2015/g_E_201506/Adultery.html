<h3 class="inline" id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>WHAT PEOPLE SAY</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sn"> Some cultures do not view extramarital sex, especially on the part of husbands, as wrong. And some do not consider marriage to be a permanent union.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="6" class="p6 sn"> In the Bible, adultery generally refers to voluntary sexual relations by a married person<wbr />—either a man or a woman—<wbr />with someone other than his or her mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:24:15-18:24:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 24:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:30:20-20:30:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Proverbs 30:20</a>) Adultery is a detestable thing in God’s eyes. In ancient Israel the penalty for it was death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:20-3:18:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:22-3:18:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:29-3:18:29" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 29</a>) Jesus taught that his followers must refrain from adultery.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:18:18-42:18:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 18:18-20</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> Adulterers break the solemn vow that they made to their spouse at the time of their marriage. It is also a “sin against God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:39:7-1:39:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 39:7-9</a>) Adultery can cruelly separate children from parents. What is more, the Bible warns that “God will judge . . . adulterers.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<h3 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sn"> The Bible allows for a married person to terminate his or her marital union on the grounds of a mate’s sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 19:9</a>) This means that after an act of infidelity, the innocent mate has the right to decide whether to remain with the unfaithful mate or to pursue a divorce. This is a personal decision.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">On the other hand, in God’s eyes marriage is a sacred lifelong bond. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) God hates it when a person seeks a divorce that is based on trivial reasons, such as simply not being satisfied with a mate. Therefore, a decision regarding divorce is not to be taken lightly.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:2:16-39:2:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Malachi 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:3-40:19:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Matthew 19:3-6</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<h3 class="inline" id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="14" class="p14 sn"> No. The Bible says that God shows mercy to those who repent and turn around from their sins<wbr />—including adultery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:19-21</a>) In fact, the Bible talks about men and women who stopped committing adultery and later became God’s friends.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">God’s mercy was shown in the case of King David of ancient Israel. David committed adultery with the wife of one of his army officers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:11:2-10:11:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:2-4</a>) The Bible clearly states that “what David had done was very displeasing” to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:11:27-10:11:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:27</a>) After receiving reproof, David repented and God forgave him. Nonetheless, David had to suffer the sad consequences of his actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:12:13-10:12:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:13, 14</a>) Wise King Solomon later attested that “anyone committing adultery . . . is lacking good sense.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:6:32-20:6:32" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:32</a>.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="16" class="p16 sn"> If you have committed adultery, you need to ask both God and your spouse for forgiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:1-19:51:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 51:1-5</a>) Learn to hate adultery as God does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>) Be determined to avoid pornography, sexual fantasies, flirting, or anything else that could lead you to have sexual interest in someone other than your mate.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:27-40:5:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> James 1:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">If you have been the victim of your mate’s adultery, be assured that God understands your feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:2:13-39:2:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Malachi 2:13, 14</a>) Ask for his tender comfort and guidance, and “he will sustain you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) If you choose to forgive your mate and continue your marriage, both of you will need to work hard to rebuild your marital bond.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">During his last evening with his apostles, Jesus has provided them with a fine lesson in humble service by washing their feet. Why is that fitting? Because of a weakness they have shown. They are devoted to God, yet they still are concerned about which of them is greatest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:33-41:9:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 9:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:35-41:10:37" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 10:35-37</a>) That weakness resurfaces this evening.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The apostles become involved in “a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:24-42:22:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 22:24</a>) How saddened Jesus must be to see them bickering again! What does he do?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Rather than scolding the apostles for their attitude and behavior, Jesus patiently reasons with them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors. You, though, are not to be that way. . . . For which one is greater, the one dining or the one serving?” Then, reminding them of the example that he has constantly set for them, Jesus says: “But I am among you as the one serving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:25-42:22:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 22:25-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Despite their imperfections, the apostles have stuck with Jesus through many challenging situations. So he says: “I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:29-42:22:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 22:29</a>) These men are Jesus’ loyal followers. He assures them that by means of a covenant between him and them, they will be in the Kingdom and share in his royal dominion.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Although the apostles have this marvelous prospect, they are still in the flesh and are still imperfect. Jesus tells them: “Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat,” which scatters as it is sifted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:31-42:22:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 22:31</a>) He also warns: “All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:31-40:26:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 26:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:7-38:13:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Zechariah 13:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Peter confidently objects: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:33-40:26:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 26:33</a>) Jesus tells Peter that before a rooster crows twice that night, Peter will disown him. However, Jesus adds: “I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:32-42:22:32" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:32</a>) Yet Peter boldly affirms: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:35-40:26:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 26:35</a>) The other apostles say the same thing.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jesus tells his disciples: “I am with you a little longer. You will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go you cannot come,’ I now say it also to you.” Then he adds: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:33-43:13:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 13:33-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">At hearing Jesus say that he is to be with them just a little longer, Peter asks: “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replies: “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.” Puzzled, Peter says: “Lord, why is it I cannot follow you now? I will surrender my life in your behalf.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:36-43:13:37" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 13:36, 37</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jesus now refers to the time when he sent the apostles out on a preaching tour of Galilee without a money bag or a food pouch. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:5-40:10:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 10:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:9-40:10:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) He asks: “You did not lack anything, did you?” They reply: “No!” But what should they do in the days ahead? Jesus directs them: “Let the <span id="page273" class="pageNum" data-no="273" data-before-text="273"></span>one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one. For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘He was counted with lawless ones.’ For this is being fulfilled concerning me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:35-42:22:37" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 22:35-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jesus is pointing to the time when he will be nailed to a stake alongside evildoers, or lawless ones. Thereafter his followers will face severe persecution. They feel that they are prepared and say: “Lord, look! here are two swords.” He answers: “It is enough.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:38-42:22:38" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 22:38</a>) That they have two swords with them will soon afford Jesus an opportunity to teach another important lesson.</p>

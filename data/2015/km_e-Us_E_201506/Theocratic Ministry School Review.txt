Theocratic Ministry School Review

The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning June 29, 2015. The date when each point is scheduled for discussion is included so that research can be done when preparing for the school each week.




             What was wrong with the way that Michal spoke to David, and what lesson should married couples take to heart from this account? (2 Sam. 6:20-23) [May 11, w11 8/1 p. 12 par. 1]

             How did the prophet Nathan react when Jehovah corrected him for telling David to go ahead and build a temple for Jehovah? (2 Sam. 7:2, 3) [May 11, w12 2/15 p. 24 pars. 6-7]

              Why did Nathan relate the parable recorded at 2 Samuel 12:1-7 instead of just telling David directly that he was guilty of serious sin? How can this account help us to be better teachers? [May 18, w12 2/15 p. 24 pars. 2-3]

              Why was Absalom able to deceive the Israelites, and how can we protect ourselves from the “Absaloms” of our day? (2 Sam. 15:6) [May 25, w12 7/15 p. 13 par. 7]

              How did Jehovah provide for David during a time of dire need, and what can we learn from this? (2 Sam. 17:27-29) [June 1, w08 9/15 p. 6 pars. 15-16]

              How can we benefit from David’s example in his dealings with a foreigner named Ittai? (2 Sam. 18:2) [June 1, w09 5/15 p. 27 par. 7]

              How might older ones in the congregation benefit from the example of Barzillai? (2 Sam. 19:33-35) [June 8, w07 7/15 p. 15 pars. 1-2]

              How do David’s words about loyalty assure Jehovah’s servants today? (2 Sam. 22:26) [June 15, w10 6/1 p. 26 pars. 6-7]

              How did Nathan display loyalty to God, and how can we imitate that quality today? (1 Ki. 1:11-14) [June 22, w12 2/15 p. 25 pars. 1, 4-5]

              In what areas of life might a servant of God use imperfect reasoning to get around God’s commands, as Solomon apparently did? (1 Ki. 3:1) [June 29, w11 12/15 p. 10 pars. 12-14]

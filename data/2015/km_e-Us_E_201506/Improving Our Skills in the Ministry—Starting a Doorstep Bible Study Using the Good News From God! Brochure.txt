Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Starting a Doorstep Bible Study Using the Good News From God! Brochure




Why Important: To make disciples, we must be teachers of God’s Word. (Matt. 28:19, 20) All of us can effectively teach the truth by using the tools that have been given to us. The Good News From God! brochure is specially designed to help us teach the truth to others. In fact, we could use it to start a Bible study with a householder on the initial call right at his doorstep.



How to Do It:
           Review the presentation in the box.—See also the March 2013 Our Kingdom Ministry.

            Put your personal copy of the brochure in your service bag. Be sure to have enough brochures to offer.

            Consider just one or two paragraphs, and stay ten minutes or less.




Try This During the Month:
            Pray for the desire to conduct a study. Also, beg Jehovah for his help in starting a Bible study and in becoming an effective teacher of the truth.—Phil. 2:13.

            During family worship or personal study, take time to embed the presentation in your heart. You can thus speak with conviction and start a doorstep Bible study while in the ministry.




When Going From House to House:
  “I’m here because people are concerned about where this world is heading. Do you think conditions will ever improve? [Allow for response.] Many people are surprised to learn that the Bible contains good news that can give us hope. Here are some of the questions that the Bible answers.” Hand the householder a brochure, and invite him to choose a question from the back cover that interests him the most. Then go to the lesson, and demonstrate the study. Make arrangements to return to consider the next question in that lesson.

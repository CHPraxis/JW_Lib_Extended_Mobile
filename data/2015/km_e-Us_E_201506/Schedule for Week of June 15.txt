12 min: Who Is Your Favorite Bible Character? Interview and talk. Begin by interviewing two or three young children in the congregation. Who is their favorite Bible character? According to the Bible, what did he or she do? In what way would they like to imitate the Bible character? Afterward, continue with a talk explaining how children can benefit from the Bible-character cards found on jw.org. (Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS > CHILDREN.) Each Bible-character card includes a profile and illustrations of the character, a map of where he lived, a time line showing when he lived, and three questions and answers about him. Each card is designed to be printed out and collected. Encourage parents with young children to make use of this tool to teach their children about “the days of old.”—Deut. 32:7.
18 min: “Learning From More Experienced Publishers.” Discussion. When considering paragraph two, invite the audience to relate how they benefited from working in the ministry with an experienced publisher.

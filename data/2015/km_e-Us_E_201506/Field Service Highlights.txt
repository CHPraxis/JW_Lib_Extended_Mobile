We are pleased to report that in December 2014 the United States had a 4.4 percent increase in Bible studies compared with the same month of the previous year. There were also increases in Bible studies in the following locations: Bahamas (2.2 percent), Bermuda (6.6 percent), Cayman Islands (29.7 percent), Jamaica (2 percent), and Turks and Caicos Islands (5.3 percent). It is encouraging to see Jehovah’s blessing on the disciple-making work!—Matt. 28:19, 20.

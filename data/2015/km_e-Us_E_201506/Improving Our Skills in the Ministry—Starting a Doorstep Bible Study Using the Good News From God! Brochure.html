(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) All of us can effectively teach the truth by using the tools that have been given to us. The <em>Good News From God! </em>brochure is specially designed to help us teach the truth to others. In fact, we could use it to start a Bible study with a householder on the initial call right at his doorstep.</p>

[Allow for response.] Many people are surprised to learn that the Bible contains good news that can give us hope. Here are some of the questions that the Bible answers.” Hand the householder a brochure, and invite him to choose a question from the back cover that interests him the most. Then go to the lesson, and demonstrate the study. Make arrangements to return to consider the next question in that lesson.</p>

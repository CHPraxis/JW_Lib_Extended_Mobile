▪ Literature offer for June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? or Would You Like to Know the Truth? July and August: Good News From God!, Listen to God, or Listen to God and Live Forever. September: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines.
▪ All tracts and invitations left with individuals or at not-at-homes should be reported in the “Brochures and Tracts” column when filling out your personal field service report at the end of the month. When a person shows interest and accepts literature, even a tract, efforts should be made to call back to further his interest.
▪ Beginning the week of October 19, 2015, the book Imitate Their Faith will be considered at the Congregation Bible Study. Congregations needing additional copies should ask for them on their next literature request. Those who prefer electronic publications should download a copy from jw.org rather than obtain a printed book.
▪ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

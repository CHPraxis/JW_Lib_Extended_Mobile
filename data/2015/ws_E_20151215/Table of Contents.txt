STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Jehovah, the God of Communication
▪  A Living Translation of God’s Word
For thousands of years, Jehovah has freely communicated with his servants in various languages. That will be discussed in these articles, and we will also see how the New World Translation has helped to honor God’s name and to make his purpose known.

▪  Use the Power of Your Tongue for Good
The ability to speak is a wonderful gift from God. This article explains the importance of knowing when to speak, what to say, and how to say it. It also encourages us to imitate Jesus’ example by using this gift in a way that honors God and benefits others.

▪  Jehovah Will Sustain You
We all get sick. So can we expect Jehovah to heal us as he healed some in Bible times? What should we remember when others give us advice about health? This article will answer these questions and help us to make sensible decisions.

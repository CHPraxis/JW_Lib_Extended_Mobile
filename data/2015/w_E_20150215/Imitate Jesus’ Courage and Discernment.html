<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">WHEN we become disciples of Christ, we embark on a journey. That journey can lead us to life, whether in heaven or on earth. Jesus said: “The one who has endured to the end [the end of his present life or the end of this wicked system of things] will be saved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13</a>) Yes, if we stick to a life course of faithfulness, we can come in line for salvation. Along the way, however, we must be careful not to get distracted or lost.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Our Exemplar, Jesus, led the way. His journey was recorded in the Bible. By studying that record, we learn what Jesus is like. We can come to love him and exercise faith in him. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:8-60:1:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Recall that the apostle Peter said that Jesus left us a model for us to follow his steps closely. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) If we carefully follow his steps, we will reach <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“the goal” of our faith<wbr />—salvation.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> In the preceding article, we discussed how we can imitate Jesus’ example in being humble and tender.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What is courage, and how do we get it?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Courage is a kind of confidence that can strengthen and sustain us. Being courageous has been described as “persevering in the face of adversity,” “standing up for what is right,” and “facing suffering with dignity or faith.” Courage goes hand in hand with fear, hope, and love. How so? Godly <em>fear </em>gives us the courage to rise above fear of man. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:11:7-9:11:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 11:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 29:25</a>) Genuine <em>hope </em>helps us to see beyond present trials and to face the future with confidence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:14-19:27:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 27:14</a>) Self-sacrificing <em>love </em>impels us to show courage even at great personal risk. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>) We get courage by trusting in God and following the steps of his Son.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:28:7-19:28:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 28:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did Jesus show courage “in the midst of the teachers” in the temple? (See opening image.)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Even as a 12-year-old boy, Jesus courageously stood up for what was right. Note what happened when young Jesus was “in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:41-42:2:47" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 2:41-47</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Those teachers were well-versed not only in the Mosaic Law but also in the man-made traditions that undermined it. But Jesus was not intimidated into keeping quiet; he was “asking them questions.” Surely he was not asking the typical questions of a curious boy. We can imagine Jesus asking thought-provoking questions that made those learned teachers sit up and take notice. And if the teachers tried to trip Jesus up by asking him controversial questions, they failed. Why, everyone listening<wbr />—including the teachers—<wbr />were in “amazement at his understanding and his answers”<wbr />—answers that no doubt upheld the truth of God’s Word!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>In what ways did Jesus show courage during his ministry?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>During his ministry, Jesus showed courage in various ways. He boldly exposed the religious leaders for misleading the people with false teachings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:13-40:23:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 23:13-36</a>) He stood firm against the world’s contaminating influence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:33-43:16:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 16:33</a>) He continued to preach despite pressure from opposers.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How did Jesus show courage on the final day of his earthly life?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>It is faith-strengthening to trace Jesus’ courageous steps in the face of suffering. Consider the courage he showed on the final day of his earthly life. He knew the chain of events that would be set in motion by his betrayer. Yet, at the Passover meal, Jesus told Judas: “What you are doing, do it more quickly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:21-43:13:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 13:21-27</a>) In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus fearlessly identified himself to the soldiers who came to arrest him. Although his own life was in danger, he spoke up to protect his disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:1-43:18:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 18:1-8</a>) When questioned before <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>the Sanhedrin, he boldly affirmed that he was both the Christ and the Son of God, even though he knew that the high priest was looking for an excuse to have him killed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:60-41:14:65" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Mark 14:60-65</a>) Jesus steadfastly kept his integrity down to death on an execution stake. About to take his last agonizing breath, he called out in triumph: “It has been accomplished!”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:28-43:19:30" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 19:28-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What is discernment, and how does a discerning worshipper of Jehovah speak and act?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Discernment is good judgment<wbr />—the ability to tell right from wrong and then choose the wise course. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) It has been defined as “the ability <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>to make sound judgements in spiritual matters.” A discerning worshipper speaks and acts in ways that please God. Such a person chooses words that help others rather than hurt them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:12-20:11:13" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Prov. 11:12, 13</a>) He is “slow to anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Prov. 14:29</a>) He “walks straight ahead,” sticking to the right course on his journey through life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:21-20:15:21" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Prov. 15:21</a>) How can we acquire discernment? We must study God’s Word and apply what we learn.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How did Jesus show discernment in his speech?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jesus showed discernment in all he said and did. <strong><em>In his speech. </em></strong>He used good judgment when he preached the good news, choosing “gracious words” that amazed his listeners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:22-42:4:22" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Luke 4:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:28-40:7:28" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Matt. 7:28</a>) He often let God’s Word speak for him<wbr />—reading, quoting, or referring to just the right scriptures to make his point. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:7-40:4:7" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:1-40:12:5" data-bid="36-4" class="b"> 12:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:16-42:4:21" data-bid="36-5" class="b"> Luke 4:16-21</a>) Jesus also explained the Scriptures, doing so in ways that moved the hearts of his listeners. After his resurrection, when speaking to two disciples on their way to Emmaus, he “interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.” The disciples later said: “Were not our hearts burning within us . . . as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:27-42:24:27" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 24:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 32</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup><em>In his spirit and attitude. </em></strong>Discernment helped Jesus to control his spirit, making him “slow to anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Prov. 16:32</a>) He was “mild-tempered.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:29-40:11:29" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) He was always patient with his disciples despite their failings.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Discernment also enabled Jesus to be reasonable. He saw beyond the letter of the Mosaic Law; he perceived the spirit behind that Law and acted accordingly. For example, consider the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:5:25-41:5:34" data-bid="42-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 5:25-34</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>A woman with a flow of blood made her way through a crowd, touched Jesus’ garment, and was healed. She was unclean under the Law, so she should not have touched anyone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:15:25-3:15:27" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Lev. 15:25-27</a>) But Jesus<wbr />—who discerned that “the weightier matters of the Law” included “mercy and faithfulness”—<wbr />did not chastise her for touching his garment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:23-40:23:23" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matt. 23:23</a>) Instead, he kindly said: “Daughter, your faith has made you well.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup><em>In pursuing his life course. </em></strong>Jesus showed discernment in choosing the right course and then sticking to it.

We are willing to listen to their opinions and when appropriate yield to their viewpoint.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:5-50:4:5" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Phil. 4:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Has it not been delightful to reflect on some of Jesus’ appealing qualities? Imagine how rewarding it would be to make a study of his other qualities and learn how we can be more like him. Let us, then, be determined to follow his steps closely. By so doing, we will stay on course on our journey to salvation and we will draw closer to Jehovah, the One whom Jesus perfectly imitated.</p>

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Imitate Jesus’ Humility and Tenderness
▪  Imitate Jesus’ Courage and Discernment
The Bible encourages us to follow Jesus’ steps closely. (1 Pet. 2:21) As imperfect humans, can we follow the perfect example of Jesus? The first of these two articles considers how we can copy his humility and tenderness. The second article shows how we can imitate his courage and discernment.

▪  Preparing the Nations for “the Teaching of Jehovah”
▪  Jehovah Guides Our Global Teaching Work
The first of these two articles shows how Jehovah enabled Jesus’ first-century disciples to proclaim the good news. In the second article, we consider some recent developments that make it possible for us to take the Kingdom message to honesthearted people throughout the earth.

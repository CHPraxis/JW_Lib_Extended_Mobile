Also discuss pertinent points from the letter to all congregations dated August 3, 2013, regarding safety precautions when attending spiritual programs.
13 min: “Unleash the Power of God’s Word in Your Ministry.” Discussion. Afterward, have a brief two-part demonstration. First, a publisher introduces the Good News brochure to a householder by reciting parts of 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, without opening the Bible. Then, the publisher gives the presentation again, but this time he reads the scripture directly from the Bible. Invite comments on why the second presentation can be more effective.

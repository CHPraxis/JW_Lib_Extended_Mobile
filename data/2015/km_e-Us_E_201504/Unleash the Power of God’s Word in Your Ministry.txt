Unleash the Power of God’s Word in Your Ministry




When a person allows us time to share the good news with him, we make good use of the opportunity and unleash the power of God’s Word by reading scriptures directly from the Bible. This was emphasized at last year’s special assembly day. The circuit overseer gave a talk entitled “Unleash the Power of God’s Word in Your Ministry.” Do you remember the main points?
           Why is Jehovah’s word more powerful than ours?—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

           How does the Bible stir emotions, shape thinking, refine motives, and drive behavior?—See The Watchtower, June 15, 2012, p. 27, par. 7.

           When we read a scripture to someone in the ministry, how can we draw attention to God’s Word in a way that engenders respect for it?—See the Ministry School book, p. 148, pars. 3-4 and the March 2013 Our Kingdom Ministry, p. 6, par. 8.

            Why is it important that we explain and reason on the scriptures that we read, and how can we do so?—Acts 17:2, 3; see the Ministry School book, p. 154, par. 4 to p. 156, par. 5.

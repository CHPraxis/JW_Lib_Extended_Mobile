▪ Literature offer for April: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. May and June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? or Would You Like to Know the Truth? July: Good News From God!, Listen to God, or Listen to God and Live Forever.
▪ The meeting schedule for the week preceding your regional convention should be adjusted in order to review counsel and reminders from the insert in this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry and the letter to all congregations dated August 3, 2013, regarding safety precautions when attending spiritual programs. A month or two following your convention, a local needs part may be used to review specific convention points that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry.
▪ Since May has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

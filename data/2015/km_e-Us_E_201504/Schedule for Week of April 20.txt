15 min: “How to Witness Using a Literature Display.” Discussion. Demonstrate the following: Two publishers are at a cart or a table. One publisher simply smiles at a passerby. The other publisher then smiles at the next passerby, asks a question as the person comes closer, and starts an enthusiastic conversation. How might we apply this approach even when we are not using a literature display?
15 min: Regular Occasions for Rejoicing. Discussion based on the September 15, 2012, Watchtower, pages 31-32, paragraphs 15-19. Stimulate enthusiasm for the upcoming regional convention.

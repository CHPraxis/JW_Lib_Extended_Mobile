BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Why should we remember Jesus’ death?






What future does Jesus’ death make possible?—Isaiah 25:8; 33:24




Jesus’ death was the most important event in history—he died to restore human life to what it should be. Man was not created with a tendency to do bad things, to get sick, or to die. (Genesis 1:31) But sin entered the world through the first man, Adam. Jesus gave his life to save us from sin and death.—Read Matthew 20:28; Romans 6:23.
God showed outstanding love by sending his Son to earth to die for us. (1 John 4:9, 10) Jesus told his followers to remember his death by means of a simple ceremony involving bread and wine. Doing so each year is a way of expressing our appreciation for the love shown by God and by Jesus.—Read Luke 22:19, 20.



Who should partake of the bread and the wine?

When Jesus first told his disciples to remember his death, he spoke about a covenant, or an agreement. (Matthew 26:26-28) It opened up the prospect for them and a limited number of others to become kings and priests with him in heaven. Although millions commemorate Jesus’ death, only those in that covenant partake of the bread and the wine.—Read Revelation 5:10.
For nearly 2,000 years, Jehovah has been choosing those who will be kings. (Luke 12:32) They are few in number compared with those who will live forever on earth.—Read Revelation 7:4, 9, 17.

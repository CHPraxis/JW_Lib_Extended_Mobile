Jesus’ Death Commemorated—When and Where?




On the night before he died, Jesus instructed his disciples to commemorate the sacrifice that he was about to make. He told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19.
This year, the Memorial of Jesus’ death falls on Friday, April 3, 2015, after sundown. Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you and your family to attend and to listen to a talk that will explain why Jesus’ death is so important and how it can benefit you.
For the time and place of this event, please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses in your community or check for details at www.jw.org.

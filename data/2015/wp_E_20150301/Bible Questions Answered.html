<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus’ death was the most important event in history<wbr />—he died to restore human life to what it should be. Man was not created with a tendency to do bad things, to get sick, or to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>) But sin entered the world through the first man, Adam. Jesus gave his life to save us from sin and death.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 20:28;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong>Romans 6:23</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God showed outstanding love by sending his Son to earth to die for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>) Jesus told his followers to remember his death by means of a simple ceremony involving bread and wine. Doing so each year is a way of expressing our appreciation for the love shown by God and by Jesus.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 22:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When Jesus first told his disciples to remember his death, he spoke about a covenant, or an agreement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-28</a>) It opened up the prospect for them and a limited number of others to become kings and priests with him in heaven. Although millions commemorate Jesus’ death, only those in that covenant partake of the bread and the wine.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 5:10</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For nearly 2,000 years, Jehovah has been choosing those who will be kings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 12:32</a>) They are few in number compared with those who will live forever on earth.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 7:4,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <strong>9,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:17-66:7:17" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> <strong>17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

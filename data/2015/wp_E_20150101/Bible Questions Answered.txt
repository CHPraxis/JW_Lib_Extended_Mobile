BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What moves many people to consider the existence of a Creator?






Is life not miraculous?





Some 3,000 years ago, a poet wrote: “In an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:14) When you consider how a baby develops from a single cell, does it not fill you with awe? Many people credit the design of living things to a Creator.—Read Psalm 139:13-17; Hebrews 3:4.
The One who created the universe and made the earth inhabitable also created life. (Psalm 36:9) He has communicated with mankind and told us about himself.—Read Isaiah 45:18.



Did we originate from animals?

In many details, our bodies are similar to those of animals. But this is because humans and animals were both designed by the Creator to live on earth. He made the first human, not from an animal, but from the ground.—Read Genesis 1:24; 2:7.
Humans differ from animals in two important ways. First, humans are capable of knowing, loving, and respecting the Creator. Second, whereas animals were not designed to live forever, humans were. But now, all people inherit death because the first man rejected the Creator’s guidance.—Read Genesis 1:27; 2:15-17.

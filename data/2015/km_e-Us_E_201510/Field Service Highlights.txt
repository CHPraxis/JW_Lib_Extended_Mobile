Field Service Highlights




We are pleased to report that on April 3, 2015, the attendance at the Memorial observance was 2,578,240 in the United States branch territory. How happy we are that so many people gathered together to honor Jehovah God and Jesus Christ during the Memorial season! Certainly, gratitude to God and his Son moved all of these to be present at the commemoration of Jesus’ death.—Luke 22:19.

20 min: “How to Reach the Heart of Those We Teach.” Questions and answers. Present two contrasting demonstrations. A householder says that her child has died and is now in heaven. In the first demonstration, the publisher responds by reading Ecclesiastes 9:5 regarding the condition of the dead. The householder is not comforted by the verse and responds negatively. In the second demonstration, the publisher tactfully directs attention to the resurrection hope by reading John 5:28, 29 and receives a much better response from the householder.

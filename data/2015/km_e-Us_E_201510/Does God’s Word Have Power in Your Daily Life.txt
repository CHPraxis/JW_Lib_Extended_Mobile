Does God’s Word Have Power in Your Daily Life?




Daily Bible reading can help us to become “rooted” and “stabilized in the faith.” (Col. 2:6, 7) However, for Jehovah’s Word to have power in our lives, we must ponder over and apply its principles. (Heb. 4:12; Jas. 1:22-25) Joshua 1:8 presents an effective three-step reading process: (1) Read God’s Word “day and night.” (2) Read it “in an undertone,” which suggests reading at a pace that allows you to meditate and to imagine the setting and the circumstances. (3) Earnestly apply “all that is written in it.” Putting into practice these suggestions will enable us to “be successful” and “act wisely” in our daily life.

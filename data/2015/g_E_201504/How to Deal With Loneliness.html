<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Have you ever felt left out and lonely? If so, the Bible has advice that can help you. First, though, consider a few things you should know about loneliness.</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>Nearly everyone feels lonely at times. </strong>That includes people who seem to be popular. Why? Because often it is not the <em>quantity of friends </em>but the <em>quality of friendships</em> that determines whether a person feels lonely. Someone who seems popular could constantly be surrounded by people but have no real friends and therefore feel lonely.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>Loneliness can be hazardous to your health. </strong>Researchers who analyzed the results of 148 studies concluded that low social interaction is a predictor of early death and that as a risk factor, it is “twice as harmful as obesity” and “equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>Loneliness can make you vulnerable. </strong>In fact, it could cause you to settle for anyone who would accept you as a friend. “When you’re lonely, you may be desperate for attention,” says a young man named Alan. “You could begin to think that <em>any </em>attention is better than <em>no </em>attention. And that can lead to trouble.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>Technology does not always cure loneliness. </strong>“I could text or e-mail a hundred people a day and still be incredibly lonely,” says a young woman named Natalie. A teenager named Tyler feels similarly. “Texting is like a snack, whereas face-to-face contact is like a meal,” he says. “Snacks are great, but you need a full meal to feel satisfied.”</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>Assume the best. </strong>For example, suppose you go to a photo-sharing Web site and see pictures of your friends at a gathering to which you were not invited. At that moment, you have a choice<wbr />—either to conclude that you were deliberately snubbed or to adopt a more positive outlook. Since you cannot know all the factors involved, why assume the worst? Instead, direct your energy toward thinking of a <em>better </em>explanation for your being excluded. Often, it is not the situation but your <em>outlook </em>that brings on feelings of loneliness.<wbr /><em>—Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 15:15</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>Avoid sweeping assertions. </strong>When you are lonely, you might think, ‘I <em>never </em>get invited anywhere’ or ‘People <em>always </em>avoid me.’ But those sweeping assertions will only make you sink deeper into the quicksand of loneliness. Such thoughts can create a vicious circle: You feel like an outcast, which makes you isolate yourself, which makes you lonely, which makes you feel like an outcast.<wbr /><em>—Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:1-20:18:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 18:1</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>Be willing to befriend those who are older than you. </strong>The Bible tells of the life of David, who was likely a teenager when he met Jonathan<wbr />—a man 30 years older than he was. Despite their age difference, David and Jonathan became close friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:18:1-9:18:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:1</a>) You could have the same thing happen in your life. “Recently, I’ve come to appreciate the value of having friends who are older than I am,” says 21-year-old Kiara. “I have some very dear friends <em>decades </em>older than I am, and I really appreciate their mature view of things and their stability.”<wbr /><em>—Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:12:12-18:12:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Job 12:12</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>Appreciate the benefits of solitude. </strong>Some people feel lonely as soon as they face a moment of privacy. But simply being alone need not make you feel lonely. For example, Jesus was sociable, but he also appreciated the value of solitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:14:23-40:14:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 14:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:35-41:1:35" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 1:35</a>) You can do the same. Instead of seeing your being alone as a disadvantage, use quiet time to reflect appreciatively on your blessings. That can make you an even more desirable friend to others.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>.</p>

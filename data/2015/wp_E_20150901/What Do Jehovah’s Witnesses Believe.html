<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that “all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) We use the Bible as a practical guide to learn about the Creator and to live meaningful lives.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible says: “May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>) Therefore, we worship only Jehovah God, and as his Witnesses, we endeavor to make known his personal name.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As Christians, we believe that Jesus, “the Son of God,”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> came to earth and became the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:34-43:1:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 1:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:41-43:1:41" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:25-43:4:26" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:25, 26</a>) After he died, Jesus was raised to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:3-46:15:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:3, 4</a>) Later he became King of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) That Kingdom is a real government that will restore Paradise to the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) “The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace,” says the Bible.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc">“When they read in the Bible, they believe God is talking to them. Whenever problems appear in their lives, they take God’s Word and search in it for a solution. . . . For them, God’s Word is still alive.”<wbr />—Catholic clergyman Benjamin Cherayath, <em>Münsterländische Volkszeitung </em>newspaper, Germany</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that Bible principles can benefit people even today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>) Therefore, we adhere closely to those principles. For example, because the Bible warns us to avoid practices that pollute our minds and bodies, we do not smoke or misuse drugs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) We also avoid practices specifically condemned in the Bible, such as drunkenness, sexual immorality, and stealing.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>.</p>

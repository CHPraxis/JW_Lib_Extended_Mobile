BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Why are there prophecies in the Bible?






Why does the Bible describe events of our time?—Luke 21:10, 11.





Many detailed prophecies are found throughout the Bible. No man can foretell the future in detail. Thus, the fulfillment of Bible prophecies provides convincing evidence that the Bible is God’s Word.—Read Joshua 23:14; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.
Bible prophecies already fulfilled give us a sound basis for faith in God. (Hebrews 11:1) They also give us confidence that God’s promises of a better future will come true. Thus, Bible prophecy gives us sure hope.—Read Psalm 37:29; Romans 15:4.



How do Bible prophecies help us?

Some prophecies warn God’s servants to take action. For example, when first-century Christians saw certain prophecies fulfilled, they left Jerusalem. Later, when the city was destroyed because most of its people had rejected Jesus, the Christians were far away in a safe place.—Read Luke 21:20-22.
Today, fulfilled prophecies show that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to human kingdoms and governments. (Daniel 2:44; Luke 21:31) So it is urgent that each person act now to gain the approval of the King, Jesus Christ, whom God has appointed.—Read Luke 21:34-36.

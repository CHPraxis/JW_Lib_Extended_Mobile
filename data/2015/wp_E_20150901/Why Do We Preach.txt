Why Do We Preach?




Perhaps nothing distinguishes us as much as our extensive preaching work—from house to house, in public places, and wherever people are found. Why do we do it?
Jehovah’s Witnesses preach to glorify God and to make known his name. (Hebrews 13:15) We also want to obey Christ Jesus, who commanded: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”—Matthew 28:19, 20.
Moreover, we love our neighbor. (Matthew 22:39) Of course, we realize that most people have their own religious beliefs and that not everyone is interested in our message. Still, we feel that Bible teachings are lifesaving. That is why we continue “without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ,” as did the first-century Christians.—Acts 5:41, 42.
Sociologist Antonio Cova Maduro wrote of “the effort and trouble to which Jehovah’s Witnesses go, to the point of exhausting themselves . . . , so that the sacred text reaches the farthest corner of the earth.”—El Universal newspaper, Venezuela

Most readers of our literature are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. And millions who study the Bible with us belong to other religions. Yet they are grateful that Jehovah’s Witnesses call on them.
Of course, you may have other questions about Jehovah’s Witnesses. We invite you to learn the answers by
           Asking one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">WHY are you convinced that Jehovah loves his people? Before you answer that question, consider these examples: For several years, brothers and sisters kindly encouraged a sister named Taylene. They told her not to expect too much of herself. She says: “If Jehovah didn’t love me, his counsel would not have been so persistent.” Brigitte, who raised two children alone after her husband died, says: “Raising children in Satan’s system is one of the most difficult challenges, especially for a single parent. But I am convinced of Jehovah’s love because he has guided me through tears and heartache, and he never let me experience more than I could endure.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>) Sandra has a serious illness that has no cure. At a convention, a sister showed Sandra personal interest. “Although we did not know her personally,” says Sandra’s <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>husband, “her deep concern brought great joy to our hearts. Even small expressions of love from our brothers and sisters show me how much Jehovah loves us.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah created humans with the need to love and to feel loved. However, it is easy to become discouraged because of sickness or financial problems or because we do not have results in our ministry. If we begin to feel that Jehovah no longer loves us, we should remember that we are precious to him and that he is there, holding our right hand and helping us. He will never forget us if we are faithful to him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:41:13-23:41:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 49:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah gave us the Bible because of his great love for us. It tells us what we need to know about him and how he feels about humans.

He often held back his anger instead of stirring up all his wrath.” Meditating on that verse may help you to see just how much Jehovah loves and cares for you. We can be confident that Jehovah <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>deeply cares about us.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 5:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah wants us to know that he loves us and that he sees more than our imperfections. He looks for the good in us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>) Let us consider how Jehovah saw the good in King Jehoshaphat of Judah. Jehoshaphat made the bad decision to join King Ahab of Israel and fight against the Syrians at Ramoth-gilead. Even though 400 false prophets told wicked Ahab that he would win the battle, Jehovah’s true prophet Micaiah told Jehoshaphat and Ahab that if they fought, they would lose. And that is exactly what happened. Ahab died in battle, and Jehoshaphat barely survived. After the battle, Jehovah used Jehu to counsel Jehoshaphat for his mistake. Yet, Jehu also told him: “There are good things that have been found in you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:18:4-14:18:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 18:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:18:18-14:18:22" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 18-22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:18:33-14:18:34" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:19:1-14:19:3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 19:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Years earlier, Jehoshaphat had told the princes, Levites, and priests to visit all the cities of Judah to teach the people Jehovah’s Law. They were so successful that even people from other nations came to know Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:17:3-14:17:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 17:3-10</a>) So even though Jehoshaphat made a bad decision later, Jehovah did not forget the good things he had done earlier in life. That example is very comforting for us because sometimes we make mistakes. However, if we do our best to serve Jehovah, he will continue to love us and he will not forget the good things we have done.</p>

At times, it is helpful to study some of these prayers during family worship. The quality of our prayers will improve when we meditate on the earnest prayers of God’s servants in the past.

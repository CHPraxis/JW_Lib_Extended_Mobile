<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>To keep our good relationship with Jehovah, we do not choose to associate with anyone who practices bad things. This includes people who say that they worship Jehovah but choose to disobey him.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>People usually want to please their friends and be accepted by them. So if we associate with those who do not obey God, we might be tempted to do what they do. For example, if we closely associate with people who are sexually immoral, we might become like them. That has happened to some of our brothers and sisters. And those who did not repent were disfellowshipped. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:11-46:5:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11-13</a>) Unless they repent, their situation can become like that described by Peter.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:20-61:2:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>2 Peter 2:20-22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

It would be wrong for one of Jehovah’s Witnesses to date someone who is not a faithful baptized servant of Jehovah. It is much more important to have God’s approval than to be accepted by people who do not love him. We should be close friends with only those who do God’s will.

You must serve Jehovah your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:24-2:23:25" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 23:24, 25</a>) But most of the Israelites did not obey God’s instructions and became unfaithful to him.

This kind of material is not designed to help Christians have faith in Jehovah and his promises. Instead, it encourages people to trust in Satan’s evil world.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Christians who want to get married need to be very careful about whom they choose to associate with. God’s Word warns us: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) When you marry such a person, someone who loves Jehovah, you will have a partner who will help you to remain faithful to God.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jehovah knows what is best for us, and his command to marry “only in the Lord” is not something new. For example, consider what Jehovah told the Israelites about people who did not serve him. Through Moses, he commanded: “You must not form any marriage alliances with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. For they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods; then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you, and he will swiftly annihilate you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:3-5:7:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>14, 15. </strong>What happened to Solomon because he ignored Jehovah’s command?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Soon after Solomon became king of Israel, he prayed for wisdom, and Jehovah answered his prayer. So Solomon became famous as the wise ruler of a successful nation. Actually, the queen of Sheba was so impressed with Solomon’s wisdom that she said to him: “You have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that I heard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:10:7-11:10:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Kings 10:7</a>) But Solomon’s example also teaches us what can happen when a person ignores <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>God’s command and marries someone who does not serve Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:4:13-21:4:13" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Even though Jehovah had blessed him, Solomon disobeyed God’s clear command. Solomon “loved many foreign women” who did not serve Jehovah, and he eventually had 700 wives and 300 concubines. What was the result? When Solomon was older, his wives “inclined his heart to follow other gods, . . . and Solomon did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:11:1-11:11:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Kings 11:1-6</a>) Bad associations affected him, and he did not remain faithful to Jehovah. If this could happen to Solomon, it could happen to anyone. That is why we do not even think about marrying someone who does not love Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>What advice does the Bible give to someone who is married to an unbeliever?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>What if someone becomes a worshipper of Jehovah while married to an unbeliever? The Bible says: “You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:1-60:3:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1</a>) Of course, this also applies to a husband if his wife does not worship Jehovah. God’s Word is clear: Be a good husband or wife, and apply God’s standards for marriage. Then, when your mate notices that you have changed for <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>the better, he or she may also want to serve Jehovah. This has been the experience of many couples.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Bad associations can influence you to disobey Jehovah, but good associations can help you to be faithful to him. Noah is a good example for us.

They kept busy doing things that pleased God, and as a result, they survived the Flood. All of us today are their descendants, so we should be grateful that Noah and his family were obedient to Jehovah and avoided bad associations. In a similar way, Christians in the first century did not associate with people who did not love Jehovah.

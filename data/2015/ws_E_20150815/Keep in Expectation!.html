<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S servants have waited patiently for prophecies to be fulfilled. For example, Jeremiah expected that the Babylonians would destroy Judah, and that is what happened in 607 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:25:8-24:25:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>) Isaiah prophesied that Jehovah would bring the exiled Jews back to Judah and said: “Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:30:18-23:30:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:18</a>) Micah too expected that Jehovah’s promises would come true and said: “I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:7:7-33:7:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 7:7</a>) And for hundreds of years, God’s servants were confident that the promised Messiah, or Christ, would come.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:15-42:3:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:10-60:1:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:10-12</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Today, we too are waiting for prophecies about Jehovah’s Kingdom to be fulfilled. Jesus, as King of that Kingdom, will soon rescue God’s servants from <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>this dangerous world. He will destroy wicked people and end all suffering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) So we must keep expecting Jehovah’s day to come at any moment and do all we can to be ready for it.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We very much look forward to the day when God’s will is done on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) But if we have been waiting for many years for the end to come, we may begin to wonder, ‘Why should we <strong>keep </strong>expecting the end to come soon?’</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why is it important for us to “keep on the watch”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus commanded his followers to “keep on the watch” and to “keep awake.” That is why it is important for us to keep expecting the end to come soon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Luke 21:34-36</a>) Also, Jehovah’s organization keeps reminding us to “await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah” and to stay focused on Jehovah’s promise of the new world.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:11-61:3:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>2 Peter 3:11-13</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What other reason do we have to keep expecting Jehovah’s day?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>If Jesus’ followers in the first century needed to keep expecting Jehovah’s day, then this is even more important for us today. Why? Because the sign Jesus gave proves that he has been King of God’s Kingdom since 1914 and that we are living in the last days, or “the conclusion of the system of things.” For example, just as Jesus prophesied, conditions in the world are getting worse and the good news of the Kingdom is being preached in all the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:7-40:24:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 7-14</a>) Jesus did not say how long the last days would last, so we must be prepared for the end to come at any time.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How do we know that world conditions will become worse the closer we get to the end?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Could “the conclusion of the system of things” refer to a time in the future when the world becomes even worse than it is now? The Bible says that people will become more and more wicked “in the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Revelation 12:12</a>) So, although things are very bad now, we know that they will continue to get worse.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 24:37-39</a> teach us about world conditions during the last days?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Some could think that before “the great tribulation,” there will be war in every country and that most people will be sick or starving. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>) But if that happened, it would be obvious to everyone that Bible prophecy was being fulfilled. It would be clear even to people who are not interested in what the Bible says. Remember, Jesus said that in the last days, most people would take “no note.” They would be living their normal daily lives and would be shocked when Jehovah’s day comes. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 24:37-39</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Clearly, we should not expect <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>world conditions to become so bad before “the great tribulation” that people would be forced to believe that the end is near.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:20-42:17:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 17:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:3-61:3:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The sign Jesus gave was meant to give his followers clear warning of the time they would be living in. Jesus’ followers have been alert. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:27-40:24:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 42</a>) Since 1914, the different parts of Jesus’ sign have been coming true. We are convinced that we <strong>are </strong>living in the last days, “the conclusion of the system of things.” Jehovah has already decided when he will destroy Satan’s wicked world.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why must we keep expecting the end to come soon?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>So why must we keep expecting the end to come soon? Because we obey Jesus Christ. Also, we clearly see that the sign Jesus gave about the last days is coming true. We believe that the end is close, not because we trust everything we hear, but because we are convinced that Bible prophecy is being fulfilled. We must stay alert and be ready for the end to come.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) Why did Jesus tell his disciples to “keep on the watch”? (b) What did Jesus tell his followers to do if the end did not come as quickly as they thought? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Many of us have been faithfully serving Jehovah and eagerly waiting for his day to come for many years. No matter how long we have been waiting, we must keep expecting that day to come soon. We need to be ready when Jesus comes to destroy Satan’s world. Remember what Jesus told his followers to do: “Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is. It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day or at midnight or at dawn or early in the morning, in order that when he comes suddenly, he does not find you sleeping. But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep on the watch.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:33-41:13:37" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 13:33-37</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When Jesus’ followers understood that he had begun to rule in 1914, they realized that the end could come at any time. So they prepared for it by doing more in the preaching work. Jesus said that he might come later, “at dawn or early in the morning.” If that happened, what would his followers need to do? Jesus said: <strong>“Keep </strong>on the watch.” So even if we feel that we have been waiting a long time, this does not <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>mean that the end is far away or that it is not coming in our lifetime.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What did Habakkuk ask Jehovah, and how did God answer him?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The prophet Habakkuk waited patiently while he preached about the destruction of Jerusalem. Other prophets before him had also preached that message for many years. Habakkuk could see that there was more wickedness and injustice than ever before. He begged Jehovah for help, asking: “How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help?” Although Jehovah did not say when the end would come, he promised Habakkuk: “It will not be late!” Jehovah also told Habakkuk to “keep in expectation.”<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:1-35:1:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Habakkuk 1:1-4;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> <strong>2:3</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What could Habakkuk have thought, and why would that have been dangerous?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Imagine that Habakkuk got tired of waiting for the end and said: ‘I have been expecting Jerusalem’s destruction for years. It will be a long time before the end comes. I do not need to keep preaching about it. Others can do the work.’ What would have happened if he had thought that way? He would have lost Jehovah’s approval. And if he had not been ready when the end came, he could have lost his life.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Why will we be thankful that Jehovah has warned us to keep expecting the end?</p>

She remembers that even while the ship was sinking, a woman kept crying: “My suitcases! My suitcases! My jewelry! All my jewelry is down there in the cabin. I have lost everything!” But other passengers understood what was most important and worked hard to save people’s lives. Today, lives are in danger. We too want to be like those unselfish passengers and focus on how urgent our preaching work is. We need to do everything we can to help people survive the end of this system.</p>

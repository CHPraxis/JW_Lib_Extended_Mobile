<h3 class="inline" id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>WHAT PEOPLE SAY</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sn"> Many, including religious people, feel that violence is a justifiable response to provocation. And millions consider media violence to be an acceptable form of entertainment.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="6" class="p6 sn"> Near the city of Mosul, in northern Iraq, lie the ruins of a once great city<wbr />—Nineveh, the capital of the ancient Assyrian Empire. While the city was still a thriving metropolis, the Bible foretold that God would “make Nineveh desolate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:2:13-36:2:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:13</a>) “I will make a spectacle of you,” God said. The reason? Nineveh was a “city of bloodshed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:1:1-34:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nahum 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:3:1-34:3:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:3:6-34:3:6" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 6</a>) And “Jehovah detests violent . . . people,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:5:6-19:5:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 5:6</a>. As Nineveh’s ruins testify, God acted on his words.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">Violence originated with the archenemy of both God and man<wbr />—Satan the Devil, whom Jesus Christ called “a murderer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) Moreover, because “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” his traits are reflected in popular attitudes toward violence, including the world’s infatuation with media violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) To please God, we must cultivate a hatred for violence and a love for what God loves.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Is that possible?</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Can violent people change?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<h3 class="inline" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHAT PEOPLE SAY</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="10" class="p10 sn"> Violence is simply a reflection of human nature, which does not change.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</strong></h3>
<p data-pid="11" class="p11 sn"> Put away “wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk.” It also says: “Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:8-51:3:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8-10</a>) Is God asking too much of us? No. People can change.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> How?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">The first step is gaining an accurate knowledge of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:10-51:3:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Colossians 3:10</a>) <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>When a person with a receptive heart learns about our Creator’s appealing qualities and standards, he is drawn to God in love and wants to please him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">The second step is related to our choice of associates. “Do not keep company with a hot-tempered man or get involved with one disposed to rage, so that you never learn his ways and ensnare yourself.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:24-20:22:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">The third step involves insight. See the inclination toward violence for what it is<wbr />—a serious weakness that reflects a lack of self-control. The peaceable, by comparison, have inner strength. “The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="rule"><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><em>“Pursue peace with all people.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:14-58:12:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:14</a>.</p>

<p data-pid="18" class="p18 sn"> “Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more . . . But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>) Yes, in order to save the meek and peaceable, God will do to lovers of violence what he did to ancient Nineveh. Thereafter, violence will never again mar the earth!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:72:7-19:72:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7</a>.</p>

What makes a good parent?





Do you teach your child to love God?



A home in which parents love and respect each other is an excellent environment for a child to grow up in. (Colossians 3:14, 19) Good parents love their children and commend them, just as Jehovah God commended his Son.​—Read Matthew 3:17.
Our heavenly Father listens to his servants, and he pays attention to their feelings. Parents do well to learn from him and listen to what their children have to say. (James 1:19) They should acknowledge their children’s feelings, including negative expressions.​—Read Numbers 11:11, 15.



How can you raise responsible children?

As a parent, you have the authority to make rules. (Ephesians 6:1) Learn from God’s example. He expresses love for his children by clearly defining the rules and the consequences of disobeying them. (Genesis 3:3) But rather than force people to obey, he teaches them how to benefit from doing what is right.​—Read Isaiah 48:18, 19.
Make it your goal to help your children to love God. Then they will act wisely even when they are not with you. Just as God teaches by example, teach your children to love God by your example.​—Read Deuteronomy 6:5-7; Ephesians 4:32; 5:1.

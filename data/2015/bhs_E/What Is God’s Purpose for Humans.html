<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">GOD has a wonderful purpose for humans. He created the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, to live in a beautiful garden. His purpose was for them to have children, to make the whole earth a paradise, and to take care of the animals.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/18-20">Endnote 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2. (a) How do we know that God will do what he has purposed? (b) What does the Bible say about living forever?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Do you think that we will ever live in a paradise? Jehovah tells us: “I have purposed it, and I will also carry it out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 55:11</a>) Yes, he will do what he has purposed, and nothing will stop him. Jehovah says that he created the earth for a reason. He “did not create it simply for nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>) He wants people to live all over the earth. What kind of people does God want to live here, and for how long? The Bible says: “The <strong>righteous </strong>[or, obedient] will possess the earth, and they will <strong>live forever </strong>on it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. Since humans get sick and die, what might you ask?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But today people get sick and die. In many places, they fight and kill one another. Surely this is not what God purposed. So, what happened, and why? Only the Bible can explain.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">4, 5. (a) Who spoke to Eve through a snake in the garden of Eden? (b) How can a person who is honest become a thief?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The Bible tells us that God has an enemy who is “called Devil and Satan.” Satan used a snake to speak to Eve in the garden of Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Genesis 3:1</a>) He made it look as though the snake was talking.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/21-23">Endnote 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So, did God create Satan the Devil? No! <strong>An angel </strong>who had been in heaven when God prepared the earth for Adam and Eve <strong>changed and became the Devil. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7</a>) How was that possible? Well, how does an honest person change and become a thief? He was not born a thief. But he desires, or wants, something that doesn’t belong to him. He <strong>keeps thinking about it, </strong>and his wrong desire becomes stronger. Then, when he gets a chance, he steals it. He has turned himself into a thief.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:13-15</strong></a><strong>; </strong>see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/24-26">Endnote 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. How did an angel become an enemy of God?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>This is what happened to that angel. After Jehovah created Adam and Eve, he told them to have children and “fill the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28</a>) That angel may have thought, ‘All those people could worship me instead of Jehovah!’ The more he thought about it, the more he desired what belongs to Jehovah. That angel wanted people to worship him. So he lied to Eve and misled her. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:1-5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>By doing that, he became Satan the Devil, an enemy of God.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7. (a) Why did Adam and Eve die? (b) Why do we grow old and die?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate the fruit. <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 3:6</a>) They sinned against Jehovah, and in time they died, just as Jehovah had said they would. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) Adam and Eve’s children were sinners, so they died. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 5:12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>To help us understand why Adam and Eve’s children were also sinners, consider this example. Imagine baking a loaf of bread in a pan that has a dent. The bread will have the same dent as the pan. When Adam disobeyed God, Adam became a sinner. Because we are Adam’s children, all of us are sinners, or have the same “dent” as he did. And because we are all sinners, we grow old and die.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/27-29">Endnote 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">8, 9. (a) What did Satan want Adam and Eve to believe? (b) Why did Jehovah not kill the rebels immediately?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Satan started a rebellion against Jehovah when he influenced Adam and Eve to disobey God. He wanted Adam and Eve to believe that Jehovah is a liar, a bad ruler who didn’t want the best for them. Satan was saying that humans don’t need God to tell them what to do and that Adam and Eve should decide for themselves what was right and wrong. So, what would Jehovah do? He could have killed the rebels and ended the rebellion. But would that have proved that Satan is a liar? No, it wouldn’t.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Thus, Jehovah didn’t kill the rebels immediately. Instead, he allowed time for humans to rule themselves. This would make it clear that Satan is a liar and that Jehovah knows what is best for humans. We will learn more about that in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015151/">Chapter 11</a>. But what do you think about Adam and Eve’s decision? Was <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>it right for them to believe Satan and disobey God? Jehovah had given Adam and Eve everything they had. He gave them perfect life, a beautiful place to live, and work that they enjoyed. But Satan had never done anything good for them. If you had been there, what would you have done?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. What important choice does each of us have?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page33" class="pageNum" data-no="33" data-before-text="33"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Today, each of us has a similar choice to make, and our life depends on that choice. We can choose to obey Jehovah as our Ruler and help prove that Satan is a liar. Or we can choose Satan as our ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 73:28</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 27:11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Very few people in this world obey God. In fact, he is not the ruler of the world. But if God isn’t, who is?</p>

It is God’s greatest gift to humans. In this chapter, we will learn that Jehovah sent his Son, Jesus Christ, so that we can live forever. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 20:28</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>By sending Jesus to the earth as a ransom, Jehovah has proved that he really loves us.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 3. Why do humans die?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The ransom is Jehovah’s way of freeing humans from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:7</a>) To understand why the ransom was needed, we have to know what happened thousands of years ago in the garden of Eden. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, sinned. Because they sinned, they died. We also die because we inherited sin from Adam and Eve.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/27-29">Endnote 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. Who was Adam, and what did he have?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When Jehovah created the first man, Adam, He <span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>gave him something very precious. He gave Adam perfect human life. He had a perfect mind and a perfect body. He would never get sick, would never grow old, and would never die. Because Jehovah created Adam, He was like a father to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>) Jehovah regularly talked to him. God clearly explained to Adam what he expected from him and gave him enjoyable work to do.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. What does it mean when the Bible says that Adam was made “in God’s image”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Adam was created “in God’s image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) Jehovah gave him qualities like His own, including love, wisdom, justice, and power. He gave Adam free will. Adam was not a robot. God created him so that he could choose to do right or wrong. If Adam had chosen to obey God, he could have lived forever in Paradise.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. When Adam disobeyed God, what did he lose? How does this affect us?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When he disobeyed God and was sentenced to death, Adam paid a very high price. He lost his special friendship with Jehovah, his perfect life, and his Paradise home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, so there was no hope for them. Because of what Adam did, “sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) When Adam sinned, he “sold” himself and us into slavery to sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:14-45:7:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 7:14</a>) Is there any hope for us? Yes, there is.</p>

The idea of a ransom basically involves two things. First, a ransom is the price paid to release someone or to buy something back. Second, a ransom is the price that covers, or pays, the cost of something.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>No human could pay for the enormous damage that Adam did when he sinned and brought death upon us. But Jehovah provided the way to free us from sin and death. Let us learn how the ransom works and how we can benefit from it.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>None of us could ever pay the ransom for the perfect life that Adam lost. Why not? Because all of us are imperfect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:7-19:49:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>) The ransom that had to be paid was another perfect human life. That is why it is called “a corresponding ransom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:6</a>) The ransom had to have the same value as the life that Adam lost.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. How did Jehovah provide the ransom?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah provide the ransom? Jehovah sent his most precious Son to the earth. This Son, Jesus, was his very first creation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>) Jesus was willing to leave his Father and his home in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:7-50:2:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Philippians 2:7</a>) Jehovah transferred Jesus from heaven to earth, and Jesus was born as a perfect human, without sin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The first man, Adam, lost perfect life for all humans <span id="page55" class="pageNum" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>when he disobeyed Jehovah. Could another man remove death for all of Adam’s children? Yes. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 5:19</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus, who never sinned, gave his perfect life as the ransom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) His perfect life could be used to remove death for all of Adam’s children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. Why did Jesus have to suffer so much?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The Bible describes how much Jesus suffered before he died. He was cruelly whipped, nailed to a torture stake, and made to endure a slow and painful death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:1-43:19:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 19:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:16-43:19:18" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 16-18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:30-43:19:30" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 30</a>) Why did Jesus have to suffer so much? Because Satan claimed that no human would be loyal to God if he was severely tested. Jesus proved that a perfect man can be loyal to God even if he suffers to the extreme. Imagine how proud Jehovah was of Jesus!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102015160/48-53">Endnote 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>How was the ransom paid? Jesus gave his Father the value of his life. In the year 33, on Nisan 14 of the Jewish calendar, Jehovah allowed Jesus’ enemies to kill him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:10-58:10:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:10</a>) Three days after that, Jehovah brought Jesus back to life, not as a human, but as a spirit person. Later, when Jesus returned to his Father in heaven, he presented the value of his perfect human life to Jehovah as the ransom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:24</a>) Now that the ransom has been paid, we have the opportunity to be set free from sin and death.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 3:23, 24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:13-58:9:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:13, 14</a>) Jehovah wants us to talk to him about any of our problems and weaknesses.

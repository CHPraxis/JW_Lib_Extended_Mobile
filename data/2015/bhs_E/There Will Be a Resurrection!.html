<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IMAGINE that you have been sentenced to life in prison for a crime you didn’t commit. There is no chance of your ever being released. Your future seems hopeless, and there is nothing you can do about it. But just when you’ve lost all hope, you find out that someone has the power to release you and that he has promised to help you! How would you feel?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We are all prisoners of death. No matter what we do, there is no escape. But Jehovah has the power to release us from death.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. (a) What can give us comfort when a family member or a friend dies? (b) Who were some of Jesus’ close friends?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When a family member or a close friend dies, our <span id="page72" class="pageNum" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>pain and grief can be unbearable. We feel helpless. There’s nothing we can do to bring that person back to life. But the Bible gives us real comfort. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Let us consider one example that shows how much Jehovah and Jesus want to bring our loved ones back to life. When Jesus was on earth, he often visited Lazarus and his sisters, Martha and Mary. All three were good friends of Jesus. The Bible says: “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.” Then one day Lazarus died.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:3-43:11:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 11:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">5, 6. (a) What did Jesus do when he saw Lazarus’ family and friends grieving? (b) Why is it comforting to know how Jesus felt about death?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jesus went to comfort Martha and Mary. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went outside the city to meet him. She was happy to see Jesus, but she said to him: “If you had been here, my brother would not have died.” Martha thought that Jesus was too late. After that, Jesus saw her sister, Mary, crying. Seeing their sadness, he felt hurt and cried. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:21-43:11:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 11:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:33-43:11:33" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:35-43:11:35" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 35</a>) He felt the deep pain that comes when we lose someone we love.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Knowing that Jesus feels the way we do about death is a comfort to us. And Jesus is just like his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Jehovah has the power to remove death forever, and that is what he will do very soon.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">9, 10. (a) Who gave Jesus the power to resurrect people? (b) Why are the resurrection accounts valuable to us?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Did Jesus resurrect people by his own power? No. Before he resurrected Lazarus, Jesus prayed to Jehovah, and Jehovah gave him the power to resurrect Lazarus. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:41-43:11:42" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:41, 42</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Lazarus wasn’t the only person who was resurrected. The Bible tells us about a 12-year-old girl who was very sick. Her father, Jairus, was desperate, and he begged Jesus to heal her. She was his only child. While he was talking to Jesus, some men came up and said: “Your daughter died! Why bother the Teacher any longer?” But Jesus said to Jairus: “Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.” He then walked to Jairus’ home with him. As they came near the house, Jesus could see and hear people crying. Jesus told them: <span id="page74" class="pageNum" data-no="74" data-before-text="74"></span>“Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.” Her father and mother must have wondered what Jesus meant. Jesus asked everyone to leave and took her father and mother into the room where their little girl was lying. Jesus gently took her by the hand and said to her: “Little girl, I say to you, ‘Get up!’” Imagine the joy of her parents when she immediately got up and started walking! Jesus had resurrected their daughter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:22-41:5:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 5:22-24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:35-41:5:42" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 35-42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:49-42:8:56" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Luke 8:49-56</a>) From that day on, when they saw their little girl, they would remember what Jehovah had done for them through Jesus.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Those whom Jesus brought back to life died again later. But what we read about these people is valuable because it gives us real hope. Jehovah wants to resurrect people, and he will.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The Bible clearly says that “the dead know nothing at all.” That was true of Lazarus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>) Just as Jesus said, it was as if Lazarus had been sleeping. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 11:11</a>) While he was in the grave, Lazarus knew “nothing at all.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">12. How do we know that the resurrection of Lazarus really happened?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When Jesus resurrected Lazarus, many people <span id="page76" class="pageNum" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>saw it. Even Jesus’ enemies knew that he had performed this miracle. Lazarus was alive, and this proved that the resurrection really happened. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:47-43:11:47" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 11:47</a>) Also, many people went to visit Lazarus, and as a result, they started to believe that Jesus had been sent by God. Jesus’ enemies didn’t like that, so they planned to kill both Jesus and Lazarus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:53-43:11:53" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 11:53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:9-43:12:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 12:9-11</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jesus said that “all those in the memorial tombs” will be resurrected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 5:28</a>) This means that all those whom Jehovah remembers will come back to life. But for Jehovah to resurrect someone, he has to remember everything about that person. Can he really do that? Well, there are billions of stars in the universe. The Bible says that Jehovah knows the name of every single star. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 40:26</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If he can remember the name of each star, then surely he can easily remember everything about all those he will bring back to life. More important, Jehovah created everything, so we know that he has the power to bring people back to life.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15. What do Job’s words teach us about the resurrection?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The faithful man Job believed in the resurrection. He asked: “If a man dies, can he live again?” Then he said to Jehovah: “You will call, and I will answer you. You will long for the work of your hands.” Yes, Job knew that Jehovah is looking forward to the time when he will resurrect the dead.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p>

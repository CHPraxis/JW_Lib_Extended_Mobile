<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD performed the first marriage. The Bible tells us that he made the first woman and “brought her to the man.” Adam was so happy that he said: “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:22-1:2:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 2:22, 23</a>) This tells us that Jehovah wants married people to be happy.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Sadly, many people have never experienced a happy family life. However, the Bible contains many principles that will help all members of the family to make their family life successful and to enjoy being together.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The Bible says that a good husband should treat his wife with love and respect. Please <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 5:25-29</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A husband will always treat his wife in a loving way. He will also protect her, look after her, and do nothing that would harm her.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>But what should a husband do when his wife makes mistakes? Husbands are told: <strong>“Keep on </strong>loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:19</a>) Husbands, remember that you too make mistakes. And if you want God to forgive you, you must forgive your wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>) <span id="page146" class="pageNum" data-no="146" data-before-text="146"></span>When a husband and wife are both willing to forgive, it will help them to have a happy marriage.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 5. Why should a husband honor his wife?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah expects a husband to honor his wife. A husband should think carefully about his wife’s needs. This is a very serious matter. If a husband does not treat his wife well, Jehovah may refuse to listen to his prayers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>) What makes people valuable to Jehovah is that they love him. He does not prefer men over women.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 6. What does it mean for a husband and wife to be “one flesh”?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jesus explained that a husband and wife “are no longer two, but <strong>one flesh.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:6-40:19:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6</a>) They are loyal to each other and would never be unfaithful to each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:15-20:5:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:15-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:4</a>) Husbands and wives should unselfishly care for each other’s sexual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>) A husband should remember that “no man ever hated his <strong>own body, but he feeds and cherishes it.” </strong>So he should love and cherish his wife. More than anything else, a wife wants her husband to be kind and loving to her.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:29-49:5:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:29</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 7. Why does a family need a family head?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Every family needs a head, someone to guide the family so that they work well together. The Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>: “The head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God.”</p>

But when a wife supports her husband’s decisions and cooperates with him willingly, the whole family benefits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>) The Bible says: “The wife should have deep respect for her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:33</a>) What if a husband does not share his wife’s beliefs? She still needs to have deep respect for him. The Bible says: “You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with <strong>deep respect.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1, 2</a>) A wife’s good example can help her husband to understand and respect her faith.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What can a wife do when she disagrees with her husband? She should express her opinions in a <span id="page148" class="pageNum" data-no="148" data-before-text="148"></span>respectful way. For example, Sarah said something that Abraham did not like, but Jehovah told him: “Listen to her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:9-1:21:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 21:9-12</a>) Rarely will a Christian husband’s final decision be against what the Bible says, so his wife should support him.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Sometimes couples quickly decide to separate or divorce. However, the Bible says that “a wife should not separate from her husband” and that “a husband should not leave his wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:10-46:7:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:10, 11</a>) There are certain extreme circumstances when couples may separate, but this is a serious decision. What about divorce? The Bible shows that the only valid reason for divorce is if a husband or a wife has sex with someone other than his or her mate.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 19:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 2. Why did an Ethiopian man want to get baptized?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>That is what an Ethiopian man thought who lived in Jesus’ time. Sometime after Jesus was resurrected, Jesus’ disciple Philip preached to the man. Philip proved to him that Jesus was the Messiah. The Ethiopian man was so moved by what he learned that he immediately said: “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-36</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. (a) What command did Jesus give his followers? (b) How should a person be baptized?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The Bible clearly teaches that if you want to serve Jehovah, you should get baptized. Jesus told his followers: “Make disciples of people of all the nations, <strong>baptizing them.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>) Jesus also set the example by getting baptized himself. He was completely immersed in water, not just sprinkled with water on his head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16</a>) Today when a Christian is baptized, he must also be completely immersed, or dipped, in water.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. What does your baptism show others?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When you get baptized, it shows others that you really want to be God’s friend and to serve him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:7-19:40:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 40:7, 8</a>) So you may wonder, ‘What do I need to do to get baptized?’</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Before you can get baptized, you must <strong>come to know </strong>Jehovah and Jesus. You have already started <span id="page187" class="pageNum" data-no="187" data-before-text="187"></span>to do this by studying the Bible. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But that is not enough. The Bible says that you must be “filled with the accurate knowledge” of Jehovah’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Colossians 1:9</a>) The meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses will help you to have a closer relationship with Jehovah.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Of course, Jehovah does not expect you to know everything in the Bible before you get baptized. He didn’t expect the Ethiopian man to know everything before he got baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:30-44:8:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 8:30, 31</a>) And we will continue learning about God forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>) But to get baptized, you need to know and accept at least the basic teachings of the Bible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. How has your study of the Bible helped you?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The Bible says: “Without faith it is impossible to please God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) So you need to have faith before you can get baptized. The Bible tells us that some people in the ancient city of Corinth heard what Jesus’ followers taught and, as a result, “began to believe and be baptized.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:8-44:18:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 18:8</a>) Similarly, your study of the Bible has helped you to have <strong>faith </strong>in God’s promises and in the power of Jesus’ sacrifice, which can save us from sin and death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Acts 4:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You may want to tell your family, friends, neighbors, or workmates about what you are learning. That is good, but always do this in a kind and loving way. Eventually, you will be able to begin preaching with the congregation. When you feel ready to do so, you can talk to the Witness who is teaching you the Bible and tell him or her that you would like to share in the preaching work with the congregation. If that person thinks that you are ready and if you are living your life according to Bible standards, then together you will meet with two elders in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What will happen at that meeting? The elders will talk with you to see if you understand and believe basic Bible teachings, if you obey what the Bible says in your daily life, and if you really want to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Remember that the elders take care of all the members of the congregation, including you, so don’t be afraid to talk to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>) After this meeting, the elders will let you know if you can begin preaching with the congregation.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. Why is it so important to make changes before you can preach with the congregation?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The elders might explain to you that you need to make more changes before you can begin preaching <span id="page189" class="pageNum" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>with the congregation. Why is it so important to make those changes? Because when we talk to others about God, we represent Jehovah and must live in a way that honors him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:19-21</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. Why do all people need to repent?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>There is something else that you must do before you can get baptized. The apostle Peter said: <strong>“Repent, </strong>therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) What does it mean to repent? It means to feel very sorry for any wrong that we have done. For example, if you lived a sexually immoral life, then you would need to repent. And even if all your life you have tried your best to do what is right, you still need to repent, because we all sin and need to ask God for his forgiveness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. What does it mean to “turn around”?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Is it enough just to feel sorry for what you have done? No. Peter said that you also need to <strong>“turn around.” </strong>This means that you need to reject any former wrong conduct and start doing what is right. To illustrate this, imagine that you are traveling to a certain place for the first time. After a while, you discover that you are going in the wrong direction. What would you do? No doubt you would slow down, stop, turn around, and then go in the right direction. Similarly, as you study the Bible, you might discover that there are some habits or things in your life that you need to change. Be willing to “turn around”​—that is, to make the necessary changes—​and begin to do what is right.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Another important step you need to take before getting baptized is to <strong>dedicate </strong>yourself to Jehovah. When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah, you say a prayer in which you promise to worship only him and to make his will the most important thing in your life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:15-5:6:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Promising to serve only Jehovah is like promising to spend the rest of your life with a person you love. Imagine that a man and a woman are dating. As the man gets to know the woman better, he comes to love her and he wants to marry her. Even though this is a serious decision, the man is willing to accept this responsibility because he loves her.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>As you learn about Jehovah, you come to love him and want to do your best to serve him. This will motivate you to say a prayer promising to serve him. The Bible says that anyone who wants to follow Jesus must “disown himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:34-41:8:34" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mark 8:34</a>) What does that mean? It means that you put obedience to Jehovah first in your life.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Baptism represents something very important. When you are immersed in water, it means that you have died to, or abandoned, your former way of life. When you come out of the water, you will begin a new life doing God’s will. It shows that you will serve Jehovah from now on. Remember that you are not dedicated to a human, an organization, or a work. You have dedicated your life to Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">God’s name is Jehovah and is understood to mean “He Causes to Become.” Jehovah is the almighty God, and he created everything. He has the power to do anything he decides to do.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">In Hebrew, God’s name was written with four letters. In English, these are represented by YHWH or JHVH. God’s name appears in the original Hebrew text of the Bible nearly 7,000 times. People all over the world use different forms of the name Jehovah, pronouncing it in the way that is common in their language.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">The Author of the Bible is God, but he used men to write it. This is similar to a businessman telling his secretary to write a letter that contains his ideas. God used his holy spirit to guide the Bible writers to record his thoughts. God’s spirit guided them in various ways, sometimes causing them to see visions or have dreams that they would then write down.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sn">How do we know that it ended in 29 C.E.? The 69 weeks began in the year 455 B.C.E. when Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem and began to rebuild the city.

The weeks in this prophecy are not weeks of seven days but are weeks of seven years, in line with the prophetic rule of “a day for a year.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:34-4:14:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Numbers 14:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:6-26:4:6" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 4:6</a>) This means that each week is seven years long and that the 69 weeks add up to 483 years (69 x 7). If we count 483 years from 455 B.C.E., it takes us to the year 29 C.E.

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sn">The Bible teaches that Jehovah God is the Creator and that he created Jesus before all other things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>) Jesus is not Almighty God. He never claimed that he was equal to God.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sn">The holy spirit is God’s active force, his invisible power in action that he uses to do his will. It is not a person.

<ol><li><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sn">              The cross has been used in false religion for a long time. In ancient times it was used in nature worship and in pagan sex rites. During the first 300 years after Jesus’ death, Christians did not use the cross in their worship. Much later, Roman Emperor Constantine made the cross a symbol of Christianity. The symbol was used to try to make Christianity more popular. But the cross had nothing to do with Jesus Christ. The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>explains: “The cross is found in both pre-Christian and non-Christian cultures.”</p>

<li><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sn">                 Jesus did not die on a cross.

<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sn"><strong>The prophecy: </strong>Jehovah gave King Nebuchadnezzar a prophetic dream about a large tree that was chopped down. In the dream, a band of iron and copper was put around the tree’s stump to stop it from growing for a period of “seven times.” After that, the tree would grow again.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:1-27:4:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:10-27:4:16" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 10-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sn"><strong>What the prophecy means for us: </strong>The tree represents God’s rulership.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>) But those kings became unfaithful, and their rulership ended.

That was the start of the “seven times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:1-12:25:1" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Kings 25:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:8-12:25:10" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:25-26:21:27" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 21:25-27</a>) When Jesus said, “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled,” he was talking about the “seven times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) So the “seven times” did not end when Jesus was on earth. Jehovah promised to appoint a King at the end of the “seven times.” The rulership of this new King, Jesus, would bring great blessings for God’s people all over the earth, forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="sn"><strong>The length of the “seven times”: </strong>The “seven times” lasted for 2,520 years. If we count 2,520 years from the year 607 B.C.E., we end up at the year 1914. That was when Jehovah made Jesus, the Messiah, King of God’s Kingdom in heaven.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sn"><span id="page220" class="pageNum" data-no="220" data-before-text="220"></span>How do we get the number 2,520?

Astrology, divination, magic, witchcraft, superstitions, the occult, and the supernatural are also part of demonism.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="sn">In the Bible, the word for “discipline” is not just another word for punishment. When we are disciplined, we are instructed, educated, and corrected. Jehovah is never abusive or cruel to those he disciplines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:1-20:4:2" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:1, 2</a>) Jehovah sets a beautiful example for parents. The discipline he gives is so effective that a person can actually come to love discipline. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:1-20:12:1" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:1</a>) Jehovah loves his people, and he trains them. He gives them instruction that corrects wrong ideas and that helps them to learn to think and act in a way that pleases him. For parents, discipline includes helping their children to understand the reasons why they should be obedient. It also means teaching them to love Jehovah, as well as to love his Word, the Bible, and to understand its principles.</p>

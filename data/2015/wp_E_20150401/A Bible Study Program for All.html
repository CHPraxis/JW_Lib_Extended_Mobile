<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In 2014, over 8,000,000 Witnesses in 240 lands conducted nearly 9,500,000 Bible studies each month.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Indeed, the number of people studying the Bible with us exceeds the individual population of some 140 countries!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To carry out this educational work, Jehovah’s Witnesses publish nearly one and a half <em>billion </em>Bibles, books, magazines, and other Bible study aids each year<wbr />—in some 700 languages! This unequaled publishing effort allows people to study the Bible in the language of their choice.</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED ABOUT OUR BIBLE STUDY PROGRAM</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<h3 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>What is the format of the study course?</strong></h3>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">We take various Bible topics and examine Bible verses that relate to those subjects. For example, the Bible answers such questions as these: Who is God? What is he like? Does he have a name? Where does he live? Can we draw close to him? The challenge is knowing where to look in the Bible for the answers.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">To help people find the answers, we normally use the 224-page book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> This book was specially designed to help people understand the basic teachings of the Bible. It includes lessons on God, Jesus Christ, human suffering, the resurrection, prayer, and many more subjects.</p>
<h3 id="p10" data-pid="10"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span><strong>When and where can the study be held?</strong></h3>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">The study can be held at a time and place convenient for you.</p>
<h3 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>How long are the study sessions?</strong></h3>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">Many people set aside an hour or so each week to study the Bible. But the length of the study is flexible. We will adapt it to fit your schedule. Some study for just 10 or 15 minutes each week.</p>
<h3 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>How much does the course cost?</strong></h3>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">The course and the study materials are free. This is in line with Jesus’ direction to his disciples: “You received free, give free.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 10:8</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>How long does the course last?</strong></h3>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">The length of the study course depends on you. The book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?</em> contains 19 lessons. You can cover any or all of the lessons at a pace that suits you.</p>
<h3 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>Do I have to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?</strong></h3>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">No. We respectfully recognize that each person has the right to choose what he or she will believe. People who gain a basic knowledge of the Bible, however, can make an informed choice.</p>
<h3 id="p20" data-pid="20"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><strong>Where can I get more information?</strong></h3>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">The Web site <strong>jw.org </strong>provides accurate information about the beliefs and activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

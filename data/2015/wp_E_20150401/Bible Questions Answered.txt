BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What does the future hold for humankind?






How does Jesus’ death make possible a society where people care for one another?




Humans no doubt will continue to make scientific advances. But will they on their own ever build a society in which people really care for one another? No. Today, the world is driven by selfishness and greed. However, God purposes something better for the human family.—Read 2 Peter 3:13.
God’s Word describes a future worldwide society in which people will love one another. People will live in security, and there will be no one to cause them harm.—Read Micah 4:3, 4.



How will selfishness be eliminated?

God originally created man without any selfish tendency. But by choosing to disobey God, the first human lost his perfection. We inherited the tendency to be selfish from him. And yet God will use Jesus to restore humankind to perfection.—Read Romans 7:21, 24, 25.
In harmony with God’s will, Jesus died as a sacrifice and canceled the effect of the first man’s disobedience. (Romans 5:19) Thus Jesus made possible a marvelous future when people will be free from the selfish tendency to do wrong.—Read Psalm 37:9-11.

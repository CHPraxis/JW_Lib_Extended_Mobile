<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible informs us that the end will involve destruction: “There will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now . . . In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21, 22</a>) But God promises us that many humans will survive: “The world is passing away . . . , but the one who does the will of God remains forever.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you want to survive the passing of this world and ‘remain forever,’ what should you do? Should you start stockpiling supplies or making other physical preparations? No. The Bible strongly urges us to set different priorities. We read: “Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:10-61:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>) The context shows that “all these things” that are to be dissolved include the ruling elements of this corrupt world and all those who choose such rulership rather than God’s. Clearly, if we were to stockpile material goods, that would not save us from such a destruction.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Really, our survival involves being devoted to Jehovah God and learning about the kind of conduct and deeds that please him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:3</a>) Rather than following the majority today and ignoring the clear signals that we are living in such important times, we need to “keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” Jehovah’s Witnesses can show you from the Bible how you can be a survivor of this upcoming day.</p>

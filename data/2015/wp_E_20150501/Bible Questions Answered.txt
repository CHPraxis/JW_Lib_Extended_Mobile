BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What is Judgment Day?






Why will judgment day be a happy time?





In Bible times, God used judges to save his people from injustice. (Judges 2:18) The Bible describes the future Judgment Day as a happy time when Jehovah, the Judge of all the earth, will save mankind from injustice.—Read Psalm 96:12, 13; Isaiah 26:9.
God has appointed Jesus to grant justice to both the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42; 17:31) Many people have died without knowing God. During Judgment Day, Jesus will bring such people back to life so that they might know and love the true God.—Read Acts 24:15.



Why will Judgment Day last a thousand years?

The dead will be raised during the thousand years. (Revelation 20:4, 12) They will need time to learn God’s ways and obey him. Contrary to popular opinion, the Bible shows that people will be judged on the basis of what they do after their resurrection.—Read Romans 6:7.
The Bible also describes a day of judgment that will occur suddenly before the thousand years begin. That day is also called the end, as discussed in the cover articles of this issue. In that day, God will remove all ungodly, wicked people. (2 Peter 3:7) Therefore, we should take care to prove our love for God.—Read 2 Peter 3:9, 13.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Christ—The Power of God
▪  He Loved People
These articles about Jesus’ miracles teach us practical lessons about generosity and helping others. They also discuss some of Jesus’ beautiful qualities. The articles give us hope for the time in the near future when we will see amazing miracles happen all over the earth.

▪  We Can Remain Chaste
We live in an immoral world, so it can be difficult to be chaste and do what pleases Jehovah. This article shows us that we can fight wrong desires by drawing close to Jehovah, by listening to the counsel from his Word, and by getting help from mature Christians.

▪  Live in Harmony With the Model Prayer—Part 1
▪  Live in Harmony With the Model Prayer—Part 2
We do not repeat the words Jesus used in the model prayer every time we pray, but we can learn important lessons from it. These articles show how we can live in harmony with the model prayer.

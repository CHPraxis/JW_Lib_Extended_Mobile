<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>Why did Jesus tell the parable of the talents?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">JESUS told the parable of the talents to make clear to his anointed followers what their responsibility is. But that parable affects all of Jesus’ disciples. So whether we have the hope of living in heaven or on earth, we need to understand the meaning of this parable.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>When did Jesus tell the parable? It was while he was giving his disciples a sign that would show that he had become King and that the time of the end had begun. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>) So the parable of the talents is part of that sign and is being fulfilled in our time.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What do we learn from the parables in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:1-40:24:51" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew chapters 24 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:1-40:25:46" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 25</a>?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>When Jesus told the parable of the talents, he told three other parables that were also part of the sign of the time of the end. All these parables describe specific qualities that his followers must have. We can read these parables at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:25:46" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45 to 25:46</a>. The first parable is about the faithful slave, the small <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>group of anointed ones who have the responsibility to teach Jehovah’s people. They need to be <strong>faithful </strong>and <strong>discreet.</strong><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) The following parable is about the ten virgins. In it, Jesus warned all the anointed ones that they would need to be <strong>prepared </strong>and <strong>watchful </strong>because they would not know the day or the hour when he would come.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.) Next, Jesus told the parable of the talents to teach all the anointed ones that they would need to <strong>work hard </strong>in caring for their Christian responsibilities. Then, Jesus told the parable of the sheep and the goats, which focuses on those who would have the hope of living on earth. He emphasized that they must be <strong>loyal </strong>and do all they can to help his anointed brothers.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (See footnote.)

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:14-40:25:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 25:14-30</strong></a><strong>. </strong>In the parable of the talents, Jesus talked about a man who went on a journey. In a similar parable, Jesus spoke about a man who went on a journey to become a king.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> (See footnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:12-42:19:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 19:12</a>) Our publications have said for many years that in both parables this man refers to Jesus, who went to heaven in the year 33. But Jesus did not immediately become King when he went to heaven. He waited until 1914, when his enemies were “placed as a stool for his feet.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:12-58:10:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jesus said that the man in the parable had eight talents. That was a lot of money.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> (See footnote.) Before the man went away, he gave this money to his slaves. He told them to use it to make more money for him. Just as the money was very valuable to that man, there was something that was very valuable to Jesus. What was that? It was the work he did while he was on earth.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What do the talents refer to?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The preaching work was very important to Jesus. As a result of his preaching, many became his disciples. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 4:43</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But he knew that there was more work to do and <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>that more people would accept the good news. In fact, he told his disciples: “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:35-43:4:38" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 4:35-38</a>) A good farmer would not abandon a field that was ready to be harvested. Jesus had the same attitude. So just before he returned to heaven, Jesus commanded his followers: “Go, therefore, and make disciples.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18-20</a>) In this way, Jesus gave them a precious treasure, the important responsibility to preach.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Like the man who gave his money to his slaves, Jesus gave his anointed followers the work of making disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:14-40:25:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 25:14</a>) So the talents refer to the responsibility to preach and make disciples.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Even though each slave received a different amount of money, what did the master expect?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus said that the master gave five talents to the first slave, two talents to the second slave, and one talent to the third slave. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:15-40:25:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 25:15</a>) The master gave each slave a different amount of money, but he expected all of them to do their best to make more money for him. In the same way, Jesus expected his anointed followers to do their best in the preaching work.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>(a) What did the two faithful slaves do with the money, and what do we learn from that? (b) What must those who hope to live on earth do?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The first two slaves, who used their master’s money well, refer to the faithful anointed brothers and sisters during the time of the end. Especially since 1919, they have been doing their best in the preaching work. In the parable, each of the two slaves received a different amount of money, but this does not mean that there are two different groups of faithful anointed ones. Both slaves worked hard and doubled the money. But are the anointed the only ones who must work hard in the preaching and teaching work? No. Jesus’ parable of the sheep and the goats teaches us that those who hope to live forever on earth must help his anointed brothers with the preaching work and be loyal to them. They feel that it is an honor to help them. Yes, Jehovah’s people are “one flock,” and they all work hard to preach and make disciples.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jesus expects all his followers to work hard to make more disciples. That is what his disciples did in the first century. In this time of the end, when Jesus’ parable about the talents <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>is being fulfilled, are his followers doing this work? Yes, never before have so many people heard the good news and become disciples! Because of the hard work that is being done by all of Jesus’ followers, hundreds of thousands of people are getting baptized each year. And they too join in the preaching work. All this activity and the good results clearly show that the preaching work is an important part of the sign Jesus gave about the time of the end. No doubt, Jesus is pleased with his workers!</p>

For example, he said that people “will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven.” This refers to the time during the great tribulation when Jesus will judge people. He also warned his followers living in the time of the end to be watchful. He said: “You do not know on what day your Lord is coming” and, “The Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 44</a>) So in the parable of the talents, Jesus was also referring to the time when he will come to judge people and destroy Satan’s world.<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span><wbr />—See footnote.</p>

Just before he goes away on a journey, he gives them money and tells them to make more money for him. When he comes back, he asks his slaves what they did with his money.

In both parables, the master <strong>(1) </strong>refers to Jesus. The slaves <strong>(2) </strong>refer to his anointed disciples.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “This Is the Way You Approved”
▪  Will You “Keep on the Watch”?
In the first article, we will discuss how Jehovah has guided his people to understand deep Bible truths in a simpler and clearer way over time. In the second, we will examine Jesus’ parable of the ten virgins and see how it can help us to keep on the watch today.

▪  Learn From the Illustration of the Talents
▪  Loyally Supporting Christ’s Brothers
When Jesus told his disciples about the sign of the time of the end, he told them two parables. One of them is the parable of the talents, and the other is the parable of the sheep and the goats. We will learn why Jesus told these parables and why they are important for us.

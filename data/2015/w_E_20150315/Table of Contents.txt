STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “This Is the Way You Approved”
▪  Will You “Keep on the Watch”?
In the first article, we will discuss how Jehovah has guided his people with teaching that is progressively clearer and simpler. In the second, we will examine Jesus’ parable of the ten virgins and see how it can help us to keep spiritually alert today.

▪  Learn From the Illustration of the Talents
▪  Loyally Supporting Christ’s Brothers
In giving the sign of his presence, Jesus related two illustrations that we will consider. One involves slaves who are given talents, and the other speaks of people being separated as sheep are from goats. Learn why Jesus gave these illustrations and how we are involved.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class = "themeScrp">“Riches are the ransom for a man’s life, but the poor are not even threatened.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:8-20:13:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PROVERBS 13:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHILE being rich may have certain advantages, wealth is a mixed blessing, especially in our perilous times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) In some lands, the wealthy, including tourists who look affluent, have become targets of thieves and kidnappers seeking a ransom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Concerning one developing country, a news report stated: “Violent robberies, fraud and kidnappings pit the haves against the have-nots. Restaurants post armed guards; the homes of the wealthy have walls with razor-wire, floodlights, cameras and security guards.” A similar situation exists in many other lands.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yet, “the poor,” the Bible says, “are not even threatened.” How can you benefit from that gem of wisdom? If you live in an area known for crime and violence or if you have to travel to such a place, do not attract attention to yourself by appearing to be affluent. Think carefully about what you wear and carry in public, especially if your possessions would be noticed. “The shrewd one sees the danger,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>, “but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The wisdom recorded in the Bible reflects our Creator’s care for us. He wants us to be safe. Such “wisdom is a protection,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>, for it “preserves the life of its owner.”</p>

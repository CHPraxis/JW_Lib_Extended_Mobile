THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT
The Messiah

The Bible foretold that the Messiah would come into the world and deliver people from sickness, suffering, and death. Is Jesus Christ that one?



How would people recognize the Messiah?

According to Bible prophecy, the Messiah, or Christ, would come in two different roles, separated by a long period of time.a In his first role, he would be a human. So that he could be clearly recognized, Bible writers foretold many aspects of his life and ministry. In fact, “the witness concerning Jesus” is a primary objective of Bible prophecy.—Revelation 19:10.
As a human, Jesus did on a small scale what he will do on a global scale as a mighty spirit creature

WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
 The Messiah would be . . .
           A descendant of King David.—Isaiah 9:7; Luke 3:23-31.b

            Born in the town of Bethlehem.—Micah 5:2; Luke 2:4-7.

            A humble proclaimer of “good news.”—Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:43.

            Despised and held of no account.—Isaiah 53:3; Matthew 26:67, 68.

            Betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.—Zechariah 11:12, 13; Matthew 26:14, 15.

            Silent before his accusers as they unjustly condemned him to death.—Isaiah 53:6, 7; Matthew 27:12-14.

            A sacrificial “lamb,” who would annul sin and enable humans to have a clean standing before God.—Isaiah 53:7; John 1:29, 34, 36.

            Killed without any of his bones being broken.—Psalm 34:20; John 19:33, 36.

            Buried with the rich.—Isaiah 53:9; Matthew 27:57-60.

            Resurrected on the third day.—Matthew 16:21; 28:5-7.


Jesus fulfilled all those prophecies and many more. He also healed the sick and raised the dead. He thus not only provided us with further proof that he was the Messiah but also gave us a solid basis for faith in the Bible’s promises that he will do those things on a global scale in the future. (Luke 7:21-23; Revelation 21:3, 4) After his resurrection, Jesus sat at God’s “right hand,” awaiting the time for him to finish his Messianic work.—Psalm 110:1-6.
“When the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”—John 7:31.




How will the Messiah complete his work?

The Jews of Jesus’ day expected the Messiah to liberate them from Roman rule and to reign over a restored kingdom of Israel. (Acts 1:6) Only later did Jesus’ Jewish followers understand that he would complete his role from heaven as a mighty spirit creature vested with vast authority.—Matthew 28:18.
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
 In his second role, the Messiah would . . .
            Rule as King of God’s Kingdom, a world government.—Daniel 7:13, 14; Revelation 11:15.

            Be a blessing to all humans who exercise faith in him.—Genesis 22:17, 18; Psalm 72:7, 8.

            “Startle many nations” and their rulers when he crushes them for opposing him.—Isaiah 52:15; Revelation 19:19, 20.

            Preserve an international “great crowd” of righteous humans into a peaceful new world.—Revelation 7:9, 10, 13-17.

            Along with Jehovah God, resurrect the dead to life in Paradise on earth.—Luke 23:43; John 5:21, 28, 29.

            Teach his subjects the ways of true peace.—Isaiah 11:1, 2, 9, 10.

            Eradicate sin, the underlying cause of sickness and death.—John 1:29; Romans 5:12.

            Ultimately break up all of Satan’s works and unite the human family under Jehovah God’s rule.—1 Corinthians 15:25-28; 1 John 3:8.


Jesus fulfilled his first role as Messiah. He will also complete his second. The wise, therefore, study him closely, for Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.”—John 14:6.
“In his days the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound until the moon is no more. He will have subjects . . . to the ends of the earth.”—Psalm 72:7, 8.




The word “Messiah” is of Hebrew origin. “Christ” is the equivalent derived from the Greek.—John 1:41.
The first reference here is to the prophecy; the second, to the fulfillment.

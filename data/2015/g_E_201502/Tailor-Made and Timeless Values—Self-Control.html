<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>THE BENEFITS: </strong>If you were to list all the benefits of self-control, you would need reams of paper! At the very least, this quality protects our physical health. “A calm heart gives life [or, “health,” footnote] to the body,” the Bible says. It also states that “a joyful heart is good medicine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 17:22</a>) Conversely, studies show that people who are prone to anger and hostility increase their risk of ill health, especially cardiovascular disease. Of course, the benefits of self-control go far beyond physical health.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Cassius, </strong>now in his 30’s, recalls: “I was quarrelsome and hot-tempered, and I often picked fights. I had very little self-respect. But all that changed when I began to apply Bible principles. I learned to control my temper and to cultivate humility and a forgiving spirit. Otherwise, I might have ended up in prison. Indeed, I feel as though I have been raised from the dead!”</p>

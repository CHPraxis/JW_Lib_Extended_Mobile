<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong>“Who may be a guest in [God’s] tent? . . . The one who is walking faultlessly, practicing what is right and <em>speaking the truth in his heart.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>THE BENEFITS: </strong>Most people value honesty and integrity. But what if an opportunity arises for a person to profit from dishonesty<wbr />—and get away with it? Now the spotlight is on the heart, the inner person.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Raquel</strong>, whose work involved purchasing supplies, said: “Certain sales agents offered me kickbacks. They promised that if I bought from them, they would pass some of the ‘discount’ on to me instead of to my company. But I recalled the Bible’s counsel on honesty and said no. My boss heard about this, and her confidence in me grew.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Had Raquel been seduced by the offer, she might have profited financially in the short term. But what if her employer found out? Would Raquel have kept her job? And what about her future job prospects? More important to Raquel were her conscience and self-respect. “A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth; to be respected is better than silver and gold,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:1-20:22:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Jessie </strong>too was honest and reliable, thus earning a good name with his employer. The benefits? Not only was he given a managerial position but he was also entrusted with more flexibility in his work schedule. As a result, he was able to spend more time with his wife and children and in spiritual activities.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When looking for prospective employees, some employers have gone to groups that are known for their honesty. For example, a company manager in the Philippines wrote to the local office of Jehovah’s Witnesses inviting Witnesses to apply for work. They are “hardworking, honest, and dedicated,” he said. The credit for this, however, goes to Jehovah God, who teaches us to “hate what is bad” and to “love what is good.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:5:15-30:5:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Amos 5:15</a>.</p>

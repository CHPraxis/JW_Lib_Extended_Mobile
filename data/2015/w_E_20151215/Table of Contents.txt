STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Jehovah, the God of Communication
▪  A Living Translation of God’s Word
For thousands of years, Jehovah has communicated with his servants in various languages. These articles show that his use of different languages has not hindered his communication with man. We will also see how the New World Translation, including the 2013 revision, has been a powerful tool to sanctify God’s name and to make his will known.

▪  Use the Power of Your Tongue for Good
The ability to speak is a marvelous gift from God. This article discusses three aspects of our speech. It also encourages us to imitate Jesus’ example in using this powerful gift to honor God and benefit others.

▪  Jehovah Will Sustain You
We all experience sickness; hence, how should we view healings recorded in the Bible? What should we consider when others make health recommendations? This article will help us to answer these questions and to make personal choices.

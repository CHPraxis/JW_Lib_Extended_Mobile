DO YOU REMEMBER?




Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
When the end comes, what are some things that will end?
Some of what will end are failing human governments, war and injustice, religions that have failed both God and men, and ungodly people.—5/1, pp. 3-5.
Who is Gog of Magog mentioned in the book of Ezekiel?
Rather than referring to Satan, it appears that Gog of Magog refers to a coalition of nations that will try to wipe out God’s people after the great tribulation begins.—5/15, pp. 29-30.
What are six things that can help someone to age gracefully?
The Bible recommends that we be (1) modest, (2) balanced, (3) positive, (4) generous, (5) friendly, and (6) thankful. Reflecting those qualities can help one to age gracefully.—6/1, pp. 8-10.
How do Jesus’ miracles illustrate his generosity?
At a wedding in Cana, Jesus turned some 100 gallons (380 L) of water into wine. Another time he miraculously fed over 5,000 people. (Matt. 14:14-21; John 2:6-11) Both times, he was imitating his Father’s generosity.—6/15, pp. 4-5.
Why can we, though imperfect, be sure that we can please God?
Such men as Job, Lot, and David made mistakes. Yet, they wanted to serve God, were sorry for their errors, and changed their ways. They gained God’s approval, and we can too.—7/1, pp. 12-13.
Will the destruction of Babylon the Great result in the death of all the former members of false religions?
It does not seem so. Zechariah 13:4-6 suggests that even some clergymen will abandon their religious course and claim that they were not part of a false religion.—7/15, pp. 15-16.
Why did Barak agree to fight only if Deborah went with him?
Barak was a man of faith. Rather than ask Jehovah for more weapons, he wanted to have God’s representative—Deborah—there to strengthen him and his men. (Judg. 4:6-8; 5:7)—8/1, p. 13.
What are some things that a Christian can meditate on?
Some of the things are Jehovah’s creative works, the value of his inspired Word, our privilege of prayer, and his loving provision of the ransom.—8/15, pp. 10-13.
How does avoiding bad associations have a bearing on dating?
We are not unkind to unbelievers. Yet, it would be contrary to God’s direction to date someone who is not dedicated to him and faithful to his standards. (1 Cor. 15:33)—8/15, p. 25.
How did Peter fail but then regain his faith?
In faith the apostle Peter walked on water toward Jesus. (Matt. 14:24-32) But on looking at the storm, Peter became afraid. Then he refocused on Jesus and accepted his help.—9/15, pp. 16-17.
Acts 28:4 says that the people of Malta thought that the apostle Paul was a murderer. Why would they think that?
When a viper bit Paul, they may wrongly have concluded that Dike, the goddess of justice, was punishing him.—10/1, p. 9.
What lesson is there in Martha’s being distracted with many duties?
Once, Martha was distracted with the preparation of a large meal. Jesus said that her sister had chosen the better portion in listening to his teaching. We need to take care that nonessentials do not interfere with our spiritual activities.—10/15, pp. 18-20.

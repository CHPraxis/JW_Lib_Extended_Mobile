<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>When the end comes, what are some things that will end?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">Some of what will end are failing human governments, war and injustice, religions that have failed both God and men, and ungodly people.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2015322/1-22">5/1, pp. 3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>Who is Gog of Magog mentioned in the book of Ezekiel?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Rather than referring to Satan, it appears that Gog of Magog refers to a coalition of nations that will try to wipe out God’s people after the great tribulation begins.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:2015364/1-11">5/15, pp. 29-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">The Bible recommends that we be (1) modest, (2) balanced, (3) positive, (4) generous, (5) friendly, and (6) thankful.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>Why can we, though imperfect, be sure that we can please God?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">Such men as Job, Lot, and David made mistakes. Yet, they wanted to serve God, were sorry for their errors, and changed their ways. They gained God’s approval, and we can too.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:2015488/1-10">7/1, pp. 12-13</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Barak was a man of faith.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">We are not unkind to unbelievers. Yet, it would be contrary to God’s direction to date someone who is not dedicated to him and faithful to his standards.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn">Once, Martha was distracted with the preparation of a large meal. Jesus said that her sister had chosen the better portion in listening to his teaching.

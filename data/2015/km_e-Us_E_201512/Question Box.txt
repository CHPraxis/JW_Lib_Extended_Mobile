▪ When is it appropriate to discontinue a Bible study?

If a student’s spiritual progress comes to a halt, you may have to discontinue his Bible study tactfully. (Matt. 10:11) Consider: Does he keep his appointments to study? Does he prepare his lesson in advance? Has he attended some congregation meetings? Does he share with others what he is learning? Is he making changes in harmony with Bible principles? Of course, make allowance for his age and abilities, recognizing that each person progresses at a different rate. Also, if you discontinue the study, keep the door open for him to resume his study in the future.—1 Tim. 2:4.

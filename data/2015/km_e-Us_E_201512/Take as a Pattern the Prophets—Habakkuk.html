<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. Why may we be able to relate to the prophet Habakkuk?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As we face increasing wickedness in the world around us, we may feel as did Habakkuk, who asked Jehovah: “Why do you make me witness wrongdoing? And why do you tolerate oppression?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:3-35:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hab. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Meditating on Habakkuk’s message and faithful example can help to sustain us as we await Jehovah’s day of judgment.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How can we show that we live by faithfulness today?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Live by Faithfulness: </strong>Instead of becoming paralyzed by self-pity, Habakkuk remained spiritually alert and active. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:1-35:2:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hab. 2:1</a>) Jehovah assured the prophet that His word would be fulfilled right on time and that “the righteous one will live by his faithfulness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:2-35:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hab. 2:2-4</a>) What does that mean for Christians living deep in the time of the end? More important than knowing <em>when </em>the end will come is being convinced that it <em>will </em>come. Faith moves us to remain watchful and give priority to the ministry.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:38-58:10:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:38, 39</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. Why must we maintain our joy in serving Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Exult in Jehovah: </strong>When Gog of Magog attacks Jehovah’s people, our faith will be tested. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:38:2-26:38:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:38:10-26:38:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10-12</a>) Conflict brings hardship, even to the eventual victors. Food may be scarce, property may be lost, and standards of living may drop. How will we react when difficulties arise? Habakkuk expected hardships, so he resolved to maintain his joy in serving Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:3:16-35:3:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hab. 3:16-19</a>) “The joy of Jehovah” will also help us to endure future trials.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. What joy can be ours now and in the future?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Those whom Jehovah preserves through his coming day of judgment will continue to be educated in God’s way of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:14-35:2:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hab. 2:14</a>) Resurrected ones too will learn about Jehovah. Even now, may we use every opportunity to speak about Jehovah and his wonderful works!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:1-19:34:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 34:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:71:17-19:71:17" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 71:17</a>.</p>

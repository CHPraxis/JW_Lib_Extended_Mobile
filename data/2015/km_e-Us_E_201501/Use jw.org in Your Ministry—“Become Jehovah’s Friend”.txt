Use jw.org in Your Ministry—“Become Jehovah’s Friend”




The “Bible Teachings” section of jw.org has a feature for children called “Become Jehovah’s Friend” that includes songs, videos, and activities. Have you used this feature in your ministry? If you are studying the Bible with a parent who has young children, why not show it to him? This may move him to explore other areas of our Web site.
While distributing Kingdom News No. 38, one brother met a woman who began reading the tract as soon as he handed it to her. She had several young children who were curious about the tract. The brother briefly discussed its contents and pointed out our Web address on the back. Since the woman showed interest, he took the opportunity to play one of the Caleb videos for her and her children, using his mobile device.
A sister told a workmate with young children about our Web site and the information it contains for families. The woman looked up jw.org along with her children. Later, she told the sister that her children were going around the house singing “Preach the Word,” one of the songs from “Become Jehovah’s Friend.”
Become familiar with this feature of jw.org, and download one of the videos, songs, or activities to your mobile device. Then you will be ready to use this section of jw.org in the ministry. What a valuable tool to help us slave for the Lord!—Acts 20:19.

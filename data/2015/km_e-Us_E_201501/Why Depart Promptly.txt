Why Depart Promptly?




When we meet for field service, we are among our brothers and it is normal to want to converse. However, once the meeting ends, we should try to depart for the territory promptly. Our preaching work is urgent. (2 Tim. 4:2) The longer we delay, the less time we will have for the ministry. We will have plenty of opportunity to enjoy upbuilding association with fellow publishers as we work with them in the ministry. Our departing for the ministry without lingering shows industriousness as we slave for Jehovah and his Son.—Rom. 12:11.

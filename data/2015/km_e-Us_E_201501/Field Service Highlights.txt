Field Service Highlights




As part of a special initiative to reach people living in isolated areas, ten temporary special pioneers were assigned in July 2014 to preach to individuals in the cities of Barrow, Dillingham, Haines, Nome, and Skagway, Alaska. Contemplating the effort being put forth to reach all with the good news motivates us to thoroughly work our assigned territory.—Matt. 10:11.

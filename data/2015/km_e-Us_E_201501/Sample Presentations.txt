Awake! February

“We are visiting briefly to show our neighbors the current issue of Awake! It considers the answer to an intriguing question. [Show the cover.] I would like to get your opinion on this example mentioned in the magazine. [Read Proverbs 29:11.] Do you think this Bible principle is relevant today? [Allow for response.] This magazine discusses four Bible principles and explains how we can benefit from applying them.”



Was Life Created?

“Do you think it is more reasonable to believe that God created life or that life began by chance and evolved? [Allow for response.] Our personal beliefs about how life began can have a major impact on how we view the future. For instance, notice the thoughts of one evolutionist. [Read the quote on page 29 from William B. Provine.] On the other hand, those who believe God created all things have a bright hope for the future.” Refer to paragraph 4 on page 29, read Psalm 37:10, 11, and offer the brochure.

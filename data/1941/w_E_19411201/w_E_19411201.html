<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam's wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and Is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DEMON RULE ENDING</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH long ago fixed the date for the complete ending of demon rule, and he commanded Daniel concerning the same to write: “The end shall be at the time appointed.” (Dan. 11:27) Jehovah has revealed to his people that the “time of the end” began in 1914, when he sent forth his King to rule while the enemy still held sway. The final end is not yet made known to the creatures on earth, but it is revealed that the final end shall be marked by the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” called Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>!</sup> Exactly on time the “war in heaven” began, and also the World War on earth began in 1914, and these two things mark the beginning of “the time of the end”. (Rev. 11:18; 12:1-12) The demons were ousted from heaven and cast down to the earth, and the Lord “shortened” the war or trouble on earth by stopping it, in 1918, in order that the prophecy uttered by Christ Jesus might be fulfilled, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) This commandment must be obeyed and the work performed by the Lord’s anointed servants. That same year, 1918, the Lord came to his temple and approved some and sent them forth to bear witness and to execute his command in righteousness, to wit, ‘To proclaim the good news of the kingdom.’ Since then, in obedience to that command, they have been making known that The Theocratic Government is come, that which honest men have looked for and hoped for for many centuries past. That witness work has been done by the widespread proclamation of hundreds of millions of copies of books and other literature telling of The Theocracy. When that work is completed, says the Lord, “then shall the end come”; meaning the final end, which Jehovah long ago appointed and which the Lord says shall be marked by the greatest of all tribulations, and which is called “the battle of Armageddon”. Now the Lord reveals to his people the meaning of Daniel’s prophecy concerning “the time of the end”, and Daniel must soon appear and ‘stand in his lot’ as one of the earthly governors under The Theocratic Government. (Dan. 12:13) The Lord has revealed to his people the identity of the two “kings” that are now contending for world domination and that are carrying out the Devil’s determination to rule the world or ruin it. The physical facts relative to the prophecy show that “the end of the days” appointed is very near. These truths are compelling and bring joy to those who appreciate them, and comfort their hearts, and increase their hope. The Lord now makes known what the two “kings” will be doing as the final end approaches. Return now to the consideration of Daniel’s prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> “And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.” (Dan. 11:40) At this point of the prophecy of Daniel it appears that the fulfillment thereof relates particularly to the time beginning in the summer of 1939 and continues thereafter. At that time “the king of the south” took the initiative and “the king of the north” was warned by “the king of the south” that the invasion of Poland meant war. To counteract this warning Germany signed with Communist Russia, as of August 24, 1939, a “non-aggres-sion pact”, which, to be sure, Germany did not expect to keep and fulfill. On the same day the pope, the head of the religious element of the totalitarian combine, broadcast to the nations of both of the “kings” an appeal for peace, and in which speech he referred to himself as ‘the spiritual authority, armed by the word of truth’. That speech was made for the very purpose of inducing “the king of the south” to refrain from interfering with the pope’s “king of the north” combine, so that the scheme of the “Axis powers” for world dominion might be carried out with the least possible interference and interruption. That is exactly in keeping with the practice of the chief of demons to keep the people in the dark while he carries forward his nefarious schemes. Mark the words of the pope, uttered in that feigned “plea for peace”. Claiming to speak in the name of God (but without saying which god), the pope said: “May you hear through our voice the voice of that Christ [anointed One] from whom the world received the great school of life.” Mark the subtlety of those words. Satan is an anointed one from whom the world has received the teaching or school concerning life (Ezek. 28:14), and in that connection he promulgates his first lie, that there is no death; and in which “school” the doctrine of eternal existence in purgatory or hell is promulgated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Satan, the chief of demons, therefore, is the one properly identified by the words used by the pope: “From whom the world received the great school of life.” Jehovah God anointed him as Lucifer, but, when degrading him, did not take away his authority, and Satan has the power of death, to take away life. (Heb. 2:14) Note in the words of the pope the following, to wit: “With us is the sound of this old Europe, which grew up in the Christian [Roman Catholic] faith and genius”; and by which words, of course, he means the old “Holy Roman Empire”, which the Nazis now declare shall be again set up and which the pope has always desired. Hitler and the pope are playing the same game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Four days later, to wit, August 28, 1939, a mass meeting, held at Chicago, of persons devoted to the Catholic faith, whose announced purpose is “For defense of Democracy”, issued an appeal and cabled it to the pope, at Vatican City, and which message contained these words: That the baptized Catholic Hitler be excommunicated to “help the cause of freedom, Christianity, humanity and civilization”. To that cable the pope turned a deaf ear. And whyf Hitler was suiting his purposes, and is still doing the same thing. That same month, to wit, August 31, 1939, the Parliament of Communist Russia ratified the non-aggression Pact with Hitler. Although the pope bitterly continued to denounce Communistic Russia and Communism in general, no heed is given to the appeal to excommunicate Hitler. On the very next day Hitler, well knowing that the pope was backing him up, suddenly ‘awoke to the fact’ that.‘Poland had done something against German/ and that ‘Germany therefore was in danger’, and so Hitler issued a proclamation stating that from now on force will be met by force; and within one half hour after issuing that proclamation the invasion of Poland was begun by Germany, and that invasion was, no doubt, with the full approval of the pope. Poland under control would make it easier for the Germans to attack Russia when the time appeared to be right; and that is exactly what came to pass. It was time now for “the king of the south” to act, and concerning which the prophecy says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* “Shall the king of the south push at him [contend with him </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Rev. Ver.)].”</span><span class="font4"> Great Britain, the chief factor of “the king of the south”, takes the lead in the organization thereof and the fulfillment of that part of the prophecy begins, and Great Britain, on the day Poland was invaded, delivered an ultimatum to Hitler that the invasion meant war. On the same date, to wit, September 1, 1939, Egypt proclaimed emergency measures throughout the land of the Nile, and on the next day German Nationalists (that is, Nazis) were asked to immediately leave Egypt. The Suez Canal, controlled by Great Britain, was closed to German shipping, requiring German ships to go around Africa. And so the push began, as one animal pushes or gores another with his horns.—Ezek. 34:21; Dan. 8:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> On September 3, 1939, Great Britain declared herself at war with Germany, and the push got in full progress. Other nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations immediately broke off diplomatic relations with Germany and declared war on Germany. September 5,1939, the president of the United States, which is really a part of “the king of the south”, issued a Neutrality proclamation for the United States; and shortly thereafter the president, at a “fireside chat” broadcast throughout the land, called for ‘all-out aid to Great Britain short of war’. Since then the United States claims to be and has become the arsenal for “the king of the south&quot;. And the push goes on 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> “And the king of the north shall come against him.” The facts clearly fulfill this part of the prophecy. “The king of the north,” “by the grace of the pope,” had been arming Germany and Italy with a great amount of war material (produced and delivered, no doubt, for commercial purposes) to start off the war, which was supplied to Italy and Germany and Japan by Britain and the United States. The commercial men saw to this, for commercial gain. Early in 1940 the push increased, and in the light of the prophecy the following facts briefly stated are of great interest because they show fulfillment of the prophecy, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Brenner Pass, in the Alps mountains, was the place where a conference was held March 18, 1940, by the two dictators Hitler and Mussolini. Shortly thereafter, on April 9, Germany, with the aid of her “fifth column” spies, invaded and seized Denmark and Norway. Britain occupied Iceland May 10, 1940, and on the same day “the king of the north” invaded Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. On May 17, 1940, the German army smashed through the French Maginot Line of forts, and the fall of France quickly followed the treachery and connivance of the Hierarchy’s agents in France.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Another act of treachery performed under the Roman Catholic Hierarchy influence took place May 28, 1940, when Leopold, the king, betrayed his country and turned over Belgium to the Germans. It is of interest here to note that King Leopold’s sister is married to a member of the royal family of Italy and both he and his sister are under the influence and spiritual control of the Hierarchy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TREACHERY AND HYPOCRISY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Two things the Devil often uses together, namely, hypocrisy and treachery. His earthly agents, whom Jesus calls his “children”, follow the lead of the chief demon, their father. June 10, 1940, was a mile-stone in demon action and fully shows the further fulfillment of the prophecy at this point. On that day Mussolini, of the “king of the north” combine, ‘stabbed France in the bacld and declared war on Britain, which Mussolini called a war against the “plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the west”. Some commander of the French troops in the southwest was a party to that deed of treachery, since those troops of France to the southwest failed to make contact with the British army to stop the spearhead of the German invasion of France and as a result the British troops were caught in a trap. The disaster at Dunkirk was the result. Shortly thereafter Paris fell to “the king of the north”, and the Roman Catholic French dictator, who had come into power, signed an Armistice with the Nazis and Fascists. Of course, that dictator had not received any suggestions from Vatican City. Immediately Hitler ordered the church bells to ring throughout Germany in celebration of the victory, and the Catholic church bell ringers obeyed. Now mark the hypocrisy of the religious element of the combine of “the king of the north”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City, that falsely claims to be neutral in this war, fools many persons with the subterfuge employed. In this connection the following facts are germane to the question under consideration: June 25,1940, the very next day after the French had fully capitulated to “the king of the north”, the official radio station of Vatican City, in a world-wide broadcast of the Hierarchy’s message, declared that henceforth Sunday masses would be recited in the Vatican grottoes and would be broadcast, to give the world, through Catholic prayers, “a New Order following the present war, an Order inspired by principles of [Catholic] truth, justice and charity.” Any sane person should readily see that the pope was fully, approving and encouraging the war being carried on by Hitler and Mussolini.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> At the same time that the above hypocrisy and treachery began by Mussolini and Hitler, the agents and directors of the Hierarchy began a vicious assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Texas and many other places of the United States. In those assaults upon God’s faithful servants, particularly in Texas, Catholic priests organized, advised and co-operated with mobs of demonized men, and then maliciously and wickedly charged that Jehovah’s witnesses are fifth columnists, working in the interest of the Nazis, well knowing that Jehovah’s witnesses have exposed the/duplicity of the Nazis more than any other persons on earth. Then quickly followed the vicious persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in many parts of the territory dominated by “the king of the north”, and also by Catholic agents in the territory dominated by “the king of the south”. At the instance of the Vatican and Hitler the Swiss government, being put in fear of “the king of the north” and the Catholic power and influence in Switzerland, and to appease that combine of “the king of the north”, seized the literature of the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and put the ban on the witness work of the Lord’s people in that country.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> At the instance of the Hierarchy Canada acted by its Roman Catholic minister and dictator at Ottawa. That nation issued a decree declaring ‘Jehovah’s witnesses to be an illegal organization’, and seized the Society’s property throughout Canada. One day thereafter, to wit, July 5, France forsakes her ally, the British, and becomes a supporter and a part of “the king of the north”. That action was taken by the Catholic dictator of France, Marshal Petain; and that dyed-in-the-wool Catholic the pope designates as “good Marshal Petain”. The Jesuits had completely carried out the Vatican’s orders of hypocrisy and treachery in France, and at the same time the Vatican’s agents were working behind the scenes in England. On July 13 of the same year the Vatican newspaper published the pope’s letter to the general of the Society of Jesuits, in which letter the pope warmly praised the work of the Jesuits, which is the most hypocritical and treacherous organization on earth. And Satan’s forces now move on!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Mark now, in the line of the prophecy long ago written, that which declares that “the king of the north” assaults “the king of the south” and tells how it is going to be carried on, to wit:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Shall come against him [‘the king of the south’] like a whirlwind.” Hitler claims his war a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blitzkrieg, </span><span class="font4">which means “lightning-war”. In the Hebrew text the entire phrase, to wit, “he shall come . . . like a whirlwind,” is just one single word, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sah-gnar.</span><span class="font4"> That word expresses the matter, and means the causing of convulsive motion and the shrinking of the skin in sudden terror. It is used as meaning a tempest; and Leeser translates the word, “will come . . . like a storm-wind,” which is a tempest. The word well fits</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the demonized rule of the Nazi manner of attack, that is, a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blitzkrieg.</span><span class="font4"> Hitler threatened to smite Britain with wild confusion and hysterical dismay, death and desolation. This was the kind of ‘lightningwar” staged by the Nazis against Poland, Holland and other countries. The attack was made, obviously, under demon timing and direction. All the attacks of “the king of the north” strongly indicate that Gog, the demon field marshal of Satan, is directing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blitzkrieg,</span><span class="font4"> or lightning-war. To be sure, Jehovah foreknew and caused his prophet to foretell these very things, and these facts should strengthen the hope of the people of good-will toward God at this time. The prophecy continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ “With chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships.” That prophetic description well fits the motorized armies of the Nazi-Fascist-Hierarchy combine. The historical Trojan horse is described by the public press as the “fifth column” of the Nazis. That part of the prophecy concerning the “ships” clearly finds fulfillment in the many sea raiders, submarines and numerous airships employed by Germany. More than a thousand of such airships assaulted Britain in one day. The Nazis claim to be building and launching 3,500 airships or planes each month, many of which are equipped with cannon and rapidfiring machine guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> “And he [‘the king of the north’] shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over”; that is, such “countries” as are the offspring of the despised Versailles Treaty of 1919, and also the Constitutionally governed countries. “Overflow” denotes surprise and suddenness, with overpowering destruction and ruin. This is exactly what has taken place with reference to the countries invaded, and such overrun countries are being brought under the control of the so-called “new League of Nations”, which the pope so highly praises and for which he utters prayers to his god. The overrunning and overflowing continues, and many countries fall to the Nazi-Fascist-Hierarchy combine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ABOMINABLE THING’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ “He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.” (Dan. 11:41) The “abomination that maketh desolate” enters where he has no right, that is, into the “goodly land”. (Marginal reading) This refers to the antitypical Land of Promise, meaning the condition into which Jehovah God by Christ Jesus has brought his covenant people, as he foretold by his prophet Ezekiel. “In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.” (Ezek. 20:6,15) (See also Isaiah 4:2,3; Isaiah 28:5,6; Ezekiel 26: 20.) In every land invaded by “the king of the north” Jehovah’s faithful servants have been trampled upon and their publications concerning The Theocratic Government have been suppressed and destroyed. The French offices of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society have been closed, and likewise in many other countries; and Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned or otherwise restrained of their liberties. In the nefarious work of the combine that goes to make up “the king of the north” that product of the demons has tried to occupy the place which Jehovah God has assigned to His anointed. The ‘abominable thing’ assumes the right to enter and to rule over the entire world contrary to the expressed will of Almighty God. Thus “the king of the north” causes the ‘desolating abomination to stand in the holy place, where it ought not to stand’. (Mark 13:14) And that is not all. In the countries yet under “the king of the south” “the king of the north” skillfully uses the “fifth column” scarecrow to destroy the liberties of the people. “Catholic Action” everywhere is a movement in the interest of “the king of the north” in its effort to accomplish world domination. The Vatican, with its various sub-organizations such as the so-callet] “Christian Front”, falsely charges Jehovah’s witnesses with being fifth columnists, and such is a hypocritical and deceptive method of turning the attention of the people away from the crooked actions of “the king of the north”, and particularly its religious element. For many years the Vatican Hierarchy leaders have had a covetous eye on the United States of America. This is the land most desired by the Hierarchy in order that the people thereof may be regimented and compelled to become Catholics, even as this has been done in Europe and particularly in the land where the Inquisition was the worst. The Vatican knows that it must destroy American freedom before it can control this fair land. Doctor Barrett, ex-Catholic priest, in his book entitled “Rome Stoops to Conquer”, has this to pay about the ambition of the Papacy, to wit: “The conquest of America is the supreme objective at which he aims. [He] is well aware that the Catholic church can never hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels, beaten and penitent, at her feet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1T</sup> The British Isles and the United States are now practically the only countries on earth where the “strange work” of Almighty God, that is, the preaching of the Theocratic message, is continued. In these countries, which are the last of the claimed “democracies”, the opposition to The Theocracy daily grows stronger. Evidently the Lord’s “strange work”, in which Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are engaged, will be suppressed in America before is heard the cry, “Peace and safety,” which cry will be sounded by the forces that are against The Theocracy ; and then ‘sudden destruction shall come upon them’.—1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The “king of the north” combine, at the instance of the religious element thereof, has already ‘overthrown many countries’, together with all popular organizations and institutions of such countries, such as the Freemasons, Jewish organizations, and other organizations that protest against the regimentation of the people. Not even the courts and the lawyers are free from “Catholic Action”. In all countries where the people have heretofore enjoyed the freedom of thought and action these liberties have been destroyed, with a few exceptions above stated, even as the prophecy foretold. It now appears from the prophecy at this point that some escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> “But these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.” Here the word “Edom” refers to the symbolic “land”, that is to say, organized religion, including the so-called “Christian religion”, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy religious organization. That modern religious demon organization claims now the spiritual, heavenly birthright, just as Esau (who was “Edom”) claimed that right from Jacob, the latter symbolically standing for Jehovah’s faithful covenant people. (See Genesis 25: 24-34; Obadiah 1-21.) This modern-day Edom, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by its political deals and financing of “the king of the north” and by the making of secret agreements or concordats, has thus far escaped the guillotine. But the end is not yet. Just now the Catholic Hierarchy organization receives the greatest consideration from “the king of the north”. When Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted in the domain of “the king of the north” this modern-day Edom takes an active part therein and with glee encourages such persecution.—Obadiah 10-16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> “And Moab.” The countries of Edom, Moab and Ammon no longer exist as independent nations, but are incorporated in Trans-Jordan under the British mandate. Whether that territory is invaded by “the king of the north” is not material; for the reason, the names Edom, Moab and Ammon are here used in the prophecy symbolically. “Moab” symbolizes the commercial or business element of “Christendom”. While the Nazi combine rages against commercialism or capitalism, it does so hypocritically, and the Papacy is the greatest capitalistic enterprise on earth. The Corporate State of Italy gives special attention and protection to commerce. The Chamber of Fasces and Corporations is composed of members of the National Council of Corporations (the pope’s guild system), the Grand Council of Fascism, and the National Council of the Fascist party. In Germany capitalistic enterprises still operate under such regulations. It is clear, and according to the prophecy and the facts, that these religionists, picturing the Hierarchy element and the commerce of Big Business, have escaped and are being retained and operated by “the king of the north” as a part of their own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> “And the chief of the children of Ammon.” These also escape. “Ammon” symbolizes the political elements, who worship the modern idol of “Milcom”, meaning “the king”, that is, the State; placing the State above God. (1 Ki. 11:5, 7) After the Flood the chief of the political system was a totalitarian State under Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-10); hence in the language of the prophecy “the chief of the children of Ammon” would represent the dictatorial or kingly ruling elements, which form “the king of the north”, and which organization is against all democratic or non-Cath-olic nations, and all of which are extreme religionists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> It was ancient Moab, Ammon, and Edom (Edom being “mount Seir”) that attempted to destroy Jehovah’s covenant people under the reign of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel. (2 Chronicles 20) The modern antitype thereof attacks Jehovah’s covenant people today, to wit, Jehovah’s witnesses and companions, and attempts to destroy these servants of the Most High. It is therefore to be expected that “the king of the north” would spare modern-day Edom, Moab and Ammon, as the prophecy foretells; and thus these “escape” from the destructive hand of the combine while it is in operation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Jehovah will not spare these three elements, however, because they form the wicked and abominable system, the ‘desolating abomination’. At Armageddon he will wipe out all of such as he did their prototype before ancient Jerusalem. Preliminary to Armageddon Jehovah sends his witnesses amongst the nations with the “cup” of his message of wrath to serve notice upon modern Edom and Moab and Ammon and to advise them of His purpose to make them drink of his wrath; and concerning such Jehovah says: “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. . . . Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon.”—Jer. 25:15-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> “He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.” (Dan. 11: 42) Those words of the prophecy, “stretch forth his hand,” mean that “the king of the north” will send forth his “hand”, or power or violent aggression, against other countries. This he has done by means of radio and other means of propaganda, such as printed matter, and the “fifth column” agents planted in many of the countries of “the king of the south”, also by his tremendous fleet of airplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The equipment of “the king of the north” is sent forth or brought to bear upon all other institutions, countries and nations. The facts show that the military organization known as “The American Legion” is largely under the influence of the religious element of “the king of the north”. Together with other parts of “Catholic Action” the agents thereof raised the false cry amongst the people, “Communism!” and they charge that every anti-Hierarchy person is a Communist, and then indulge in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, who expose the totalitarian rule, including the Nazis and Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL TOTALITARIAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” And “the land of Egypt” feels the hand of “the king of the north”. The land of Egypt was originally the place or domain of “the king of the south”. At this point in Daniel’s prophecy “the king of the south” seems to disappear, since there is no more mention made of that “king” in the prophecy, nor does the name “Egypt” appear to be used as equivalent to or in the place of “the king of the south”. This cannot be taken to mean that the British Commonwealth of Nations or the United States of America, and the other Americas, will be wiped out by “the king of the north”. In fact, the prophecy does not disclose which one of these, ‘Tangs” shall be victorious in the present war, but the opinion is here expressed that neither one will have a complete victory. The end of the war will come about in a manner somewhat different from what worldly prognosticators say. What this part of the prophecy does appear to mean is that, before the “end”, within the meaning of the prophecy, all the nations, including those forming “the king of the south&quot;, will take on or become dictatorial governments, which these nations will believe is necessary in order to fight the peril of the totalitarian ‘Tang of the north”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> And now, in the closing days of 1941, what are the facts relating to this part of the prophecy! The British Commonwealth of Nations, and the United States, and other countries forming “the king of the south” have ceased to be democracies, that is, governments of the people, by the people, and for the people. In each one of these nations all power is placed in the hands of a few, and the prime minister and the president are for all intents and purposes dictators even at the present time. Under the claim of necessity for national defense the president controls practically all production in the United States. Even the government tells the tillers just how much wheat they may sow upon their land, and what they may do with it, even though every thoughtful person knows that famine and shortage of bread stare the whole world in the face. A national socialism has seized hold of all the nations of the earth, and therefore demon rule has blinded the ruling powers of all the nations, and all nations are doing the bidding of the chief demon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; The Watchtower is not complaining nor murmuring at what the governments have become or what they are doing, but the Watchtower is pointing out these facts showing that the prophecy of Almighty God concerning the nations and their course of action is now being fulfilled, and which sounds'the warning to all people of good-will toward God to flee immediately to Jehovah and Christ Jesus, the great Theocracy. Seven years ago </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> pointed out that according to the prophecies the United States would become a dictatorial government; and now the admitted and indisputable facts fully support that conclusion, which conclusion was and is based entirely upon the Word of God. All sober-minded persons, therefore, see that what is now coming to pass was foreknown and foretold by Jehovah, and this should cause all who desire to know what is right to immediately give prayerful consideration to what is written in the Scriptures. There is but one sure guide at this time, and at all times, and that guide is the word of Almighty God set down in the Bible. Jehovah’s servants or witnesses for some years have been diligently and earnestly endeavoring to inform the people of what the Bible reveals, disclosing God’s purpose, and this they have done and are doing in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> takes no part in the controversy between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is entirely neutral because it is for The Theocracy. It stands aloof from all worldly disputes and controversies and in obedience to the Lord’s commandment points the people to the infallible word of Jehovah’s prophecies and to the physical facts that have come to pass in fulfillment thereof, and this is done to the end that those who desire to learn the way to righteousness and safety may find the same. As to the final result, Jehovah has made that plainly to appear, and the Watchtower understands and is diligently endeavoring to obey the commandment of the Most High and to make these truths known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” In this prophecy of Daniel 11:42 the words ‘land of Egypt” do not mean the literal country in North Africa, but do mean the world of religion, politics, commerce and militarism, over which the demons now rule. Because religion, politics and commerce do not resist the totalitarian rule of “the king of the north” these elements escape the violent assaults of that “king”. “Egypt,” as used in the prophecy, means and pictures the great rival nations also made up of politics, commerce and religion, and military, and which are in opposition to “the king of the north”. Both are bent on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world domination. </span><span class="font4">Therefore the prophecy says: “The land of Egypt shall not escape.” The commerce of “the king of the south”, particularly Britain, has not escaped the destructive work of “the king of the north”. Nor has the commercial business of the United States of America escaped, but has suffered under the burden carried to offset the results of the “king of the north” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blitzkrieg.</span><span class="font4"> The business or commercial interests of America must now yield to the “priority” requirements, and the people are compelled to bear that burden. Conditions in the United States are necessarily becoming worse and will continue to grow worse. Private business will be practically paralyzed. The food supply will be greatly reduced, and the people will be compelled to suffer many inconveniences. The conditions disagreeable will continue and will grow worse and worse until this land, like others throughout the earth, puts the clamps on the message of Jehovah God, and then the exulting cry of the religious element of “the king of the north” will ring out: “We are at peace and safety.” That is the sign! The next step to immediately follow, the Lord makes plain. The prophecy continues to tell of the activities of “the king of the north”, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> “But he shall have power [rule] over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.” (Dan. 11:43) These “treasures”, or “hidden things”, appear to mean that “the king of the north” lays hold upon all private wealth in the land controlled by that “king” and also controls all the gold, silver and precious things of the nations and people under that “king” by using the same to carry on his military purposes. Will the Vatican and its hoarded wealth escape finally! The picture or drama appearing in the prophecy of God’s Word (2 Chronicles 20) seems clearly to indicate that the Vatican will not escape the ruthless hand of her present-day ally. In the light of prophecy it will be well to watch the developments. Even at this time in some areas Catholic church organizations have been asked to contribute half of their gold, silver and art treasures to support the Axis powers. A like procedure is almost certain to follow in many other places. The totalitarian rulers will be able to exercise control over the material wealth of the nations of the earth; which is even now being done to a large degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">«o ki<sub>n</sub>g <sub>o</sub>f north” also tries to exercise power over the “hidden treasures” of the Bible, which are the most precious treasures. (Pss. 19:7-10; 12:6) The publication of these precious truths is forbidden in all countries controlled by “the king of the north”, and in many countries controlled by “the king of the south”. The modern-day Belshazzar has brought out the precious vessels of Jehovah’s earthly organization, and out of them the demon-controlled ones attempt to drink. “The king of the north” treats the living vessels of Jehovah’s message with contempt and exercises power over their physical bodies, to break their integrity toward The Theocracy, but without success.—Dan. 5:1-4; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">November 1, 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> “And over all the precious things [(Fount's) desirable things] of Egypt.” This does not mean the military defeat of “the king of the south”, but rather shows that the totalitarian, arbitrary rule will extend over all the nations of the earth. The “desirable things” of Egypt are not things of Jehovah’s organization, but are the things of this wicked world organization under the control of the demons, and which organization “spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified”. (Rev. 11:8) The ‘king” has identified himself as the organization which Satan controls. A like condition of seizing the desirable things will continue in all nations up to the time of the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> “And the Libyans,” says the prophecy. The name “Libya” means thirsty, that is, dry. Being neighbors of Egypt, they picture those who are “good neighbors” to the other nations about, for what they can get out of it in return. They are willing to submit to the arbitrary rule if that means commercial profit to them. They do not enjoy the waters of truth of God’s Word, but they express a dry condition and among them there is a famine for the hearing of the Word of God, and that is because of demon influence.— Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ “And the Ethiopians”; meaning the dark-skinned, or the organizations that are friends and allies of commerce. (See Isaiah 20: 3-5; Isaiah 37: 9.) ‘Darkskins’ pictured those who today are in the dark as to Jehovah’s purpose. (Jer. 13:23) They attack Jehovah’s servants at the command of the leading religionists, even as their prototype attacked Jerusalem and Judah. (2 Ki. 19:9; 2 Chron. 14:9-13) All of these obey “the king of the north”, or arbitrary rule, and “shall be at his steps”, so says the prophecy. This describes the hangers-on to the commercial or Big Business world, the organization for self-gain, and who are willing to forsake “the king of the south” and democracies and submit themselves to “the king of the north” and to arbitrary rule just so they get something out of it. Such find a striking modern-day example in some of the businessmen in the nation, who are willing to forsake Democracy and go over to the Corporate State, and who submit to the regimentation of the people in order that they might enjoy some individual pecuniary gain. These are also known as “appeasers”, and always with an eye to business. They will be heard today saying: “It is all right for the Hierarchy and the Nazis to rule America, if we get ours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup>‘ Mark this in light of the infallible divine prophecy: that the totalitarian, arbitrary rule will overrun all the nations of the earth in the very near future. Some makeshift of peace will be made, and the chief credit for such patched-up peace will be given to the religious element, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The totalitarian rule will be fully in control, and then will appear the sign. The prophecy of Daniel indicates what shall follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>’’GREAT MULTITUDE” SURVIVES ARMAGEDDON</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">L</span><span class="font4">ONG ago the great Creator provided that under the coming Theocratic Government of Righteousness and its King there should be those who would receive life as human creatures and continue to live for ever on the earth and who shall multiply and fill the cleansed earth with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of those who are chosen and to whom the divine promise is given that they shall be of the kingdom of heaven, or Theocratic Government, and that they shall reign with Christ Jesus in the spirit, is small when compared with the number of those who may ultimately receive life as perfect human creatures. To those who from the time of Christ’s apostles till the second coming of the Lord Jesus have chosen to follow and obey Christ Jesus and who have continued and do continue faithful unto death, Christ Jesus the King of The Theocratic Government gives these precious promises: “But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock ; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days [symbolizing the completeness of the time of your earthly existence] ; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Luke 12: 31, 32 and Revelation 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ‘Tittle flock” being gathered first, Christ Jesus “the Good Shepherd” then says: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:16) Those whom the Lord here calls his “other sheep” are the ones who shall compose the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors that has no limit as to number but is made up of all those who during the present judgment of the nations by Christ Jesus are placed on “his right hand”, or place of favor, and are designated “his sheep”, and who receive on earth the blessings of the Kingdom. (See Matthew 25: 34.) On the other hand, in Revelation 7:4-8 it is stated that this “little flock” consists of 144,000 followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who are made members of “his body”.—1 Cor. 12:12,18, 27 ; Col. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately following the description of the body members of Christ who are designated his “little flock”, Revelation 7:9-17 makes this statement: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts [ living ones], and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It therefore clearly appears that the spirit class, the “body of Christ”, are a fixed number, because these are a part of the Kingdom. Those of the “great multitude” are not a limited number, but rather the Lord opens the way for as many to come as may desire to serve him. He puts no limitation on the number. These come from all nations. They stand “before the throne”, which shows that they are not in the throne and are not a part of the Kingdom or Theocratic Government. In order to be “before the throne” they do not have to be in heaven for judgment, but, on the contrary, their judgment takes place on earth; and this is shown by the words of Jesus at Matthew 25 -31, 32. They stand before the “Lamb”, that is, before Christ Jesus, the great Judge and King. They have a standing and thus are received by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who shall form the “great multitude”, that is, the “other sheep” of the Lord, must identify themselves before all other creation as having faith in and being on the side of the great Theocrat and his King, and this they must do before the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” begins. In the Scriptures the garment or mantle a man wears is a means of identification denoting where he stands and whom he supports. The “white robes” with which the “great multitude” are clothed symbolically testify that the persons wearing the same are on the side of righteousness. The Theocracy is on the side of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Palm branches in their hands’ symbolically testifies for them: “We are supporters of the King of The Theocracy, Christ Jesus; therefore we are for God and for the Lamb, Christ Jesus.” All these refuse to hail, honor, praise and worship men or things and thereby ascribe salvation to men or things or man-made organizations and thereby also violate the commandment stated at Exodus 20: 3-5. All of those of the “great multitude” ascribe salvation to God and to his Lamb, Christ Jesus, the King. All of these make known that they are for The Theocracy. They are diligent to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus is the Chief Corner Stone of God’s building. (Isa. 28:16; Ps. 118:22; Matt. 21:42-44) Nineteen hundred years ago, when the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem upon the ass and presented himself to the Jews as King, this was the laying of the Corner Stone in a miniature way, but it foreshadowed the laying of the Corner Stone in completeness when the Kingdom is set up and Christ Jesus thereafter, in A.D. 1918, appears at the temple as King of The Theocratic Government. When the Lord Jesus, “which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,” rode into Jerusalem he was there hailed by the multitude as King; as it is written: “And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest 1”—Matt. 21: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle John wrote The Revelation, and in his recording of the account of the miniature laying of the Corner Stone John wrote: “On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.” (John 12:12,13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> In this account and in The Revelation, chapter seven, John makes mention of the palm branches, and that in connection with the “great multitude”. Thus what took place at the miniature laying of the Corner Stone at Jerusalem foreshadowed that which John saw in vision of the laying of the Corner Stone in completeness in A.D. 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus entered Jerusalem the great multitude that spread down their garments and waved their palm branches were not then the disciples of Jesus Christ, as the facts subsequently showed. Only a short time before that triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem he had addressed his disciples, speaking to them as a “little flock”. It was afterwards and when Jesus was riding upon an ass as King that the great multitude appeared and shouted: ‘Hosanna to the son of David; blessed is he that cometh in the name of Jehovah!’ Likewise when Jesus Christ is enthroned in heaven, in A.D. 1914, the “great multitude” as pictured in Revelation chapter seven are not recognized, discerned and understood, and are not members of the “little flock” or members of “the body of Christ”. It is after he is presented at the temple as King, in A.D. 1918, and seated upon his throne of judgment, that the “great multitude” are discerned with “palms in their hands”. This would prove that the “great multitude” began to come into existence after the Lord Jesus Christ appeared at the temple for judgment. The facts and the evidence that have come to pass during the past ten years conclusively prove that the “great multitude” will be made up of human creatures who hear and accept and rejoice in the Kingdom of God under Christ. The palms in their hands in effect say: “We hail our King and Savior; our allegiance and our devotion are to him. Our salvation comes from the great King Eternal, who is Jehovah, and through Christ Jesus, his anointed Ruler of the new world.” They openly confess that they are on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Revelation 7:11,12 describes the heavenly creatures joining in the praise of Jehovah because the time has come for the gathering of the Lord’s “other sheep”. Then it was that the question was put forth concerning the “great multitude” : “What are these which are arrayed in white robes ? and whence came they?” The answer is given: “These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” (Verses 13,14) That means that they have been gathered unto the Lord in troublesome times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those of God’s royal house, or Kingdom, that is, the 144,000, have great tribulation on earth, and such tribulation has extended over the entire Christian era so far as this is concerned; but the greatest of all tribulations mentioned in the Scriptures must come after the “great multitude” appears and must be that which is mentioned by Christ Jesus, at Matthew 24:21, as “tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time”. That tribulation period began with the “day of Jehovah”, to wit, in 1914, when the “war in heaven” started against Satan’s organization and Satan was thereafter cast out and down to the earth. (Rev. 12:7-10) The tribulation reaches the great climax at the time of the battle of Armageddon, the great day of God Almighty. In harmony with this, Revelation 7:14 calls it “the great tribulation” (Am. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clearly it follows that this tribulation does not come for the purpose of developing or completing the “great multitude”, but it is the tribulation that comes upon Satan's organization, both visible and invisible, and which will completely wreck that entire organization. As we have observed, “the day of Jehovah” began in 1914, at the birth of The Kingdom. (See Revelation 11:15-18.) Had that tribulation, then begun, continued to its finality without interruption, all flesh would have been destroyed. The tribulation was shortened by the Lord when the World War ended (Matt. 24:22; Mark 13:20), and thus was afforded an opportunity for Jehovah’s witnesses under his commandment to go forth and bear testimony to his name and his kingdom as a witness to the world. It is during this period of giving testimony, that is, the ‘preaching of this gospel of the kingdom’, that the Lord’s “other sheep” who shall form the “great multitude” come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To “come out of the great tribulation” not alone means to survive that trouble as ‘flesh that shall be saved’ (Matt. 24:22), but primarily means that they come out from Satan’s organization and take their stand on the side erf Jehovah during the period of time that elapses from the stopping of the World War in 1918 until the day of Armageddon, that is to say, during the time that Jesus said the “days should be shortened” and during which same time period “this gospel of the kingdom” is preached in all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is the purpose of shortening those days of tribulation? The Lord Jesus answers: “For the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” (Matt. 24: 22) During that period of time the elect’s remnant on earth have a work to do as witnesses for Jehovah and under his commandment, and at least a part of that work is the marking of those “other sheep” who shall form the “great multitude” in their foreheads, as commanded by the Lord at Ezekiel 9:4. That means that Jehovah’s witnesses must proclaim the message of the truth and thus give an intellectual understanding of the truth to the “other sheep”, which class “flee into the mountains”, symbolizing The Theocratic Government. This is “immediately after the tribulation of those days”, as stated at Matthew 24:29; that is to say, after the first part of the tribulation, from 1914 to 1918. Those who will compose the “great multitude” will also survive Armageddon, because God’s promise to those who seek meekness and righteousness is that they may be hid in that time. (See Zephaniah 2:3.) All of these scriptures negative the thought that the tribulation is for the purpose of developing or perfecting this class of people. The great tribulation is the execution of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s organization, and is not for the purpose of developing any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the language of Revelation 7:14 the Lord’s “other sheep” do their own washing of their robes; that is, by reason of the course of action they take they break away from the unclean organization of Satan and openly show themselves on the side of Jehovah, and this they do by openly confessing their devotion to God. “With the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Rom. 10:10) Coming to a knowledge of the fact that Jehovah’s name must be vindicated by his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, and that that is the important question, they not only confess themselves on the side of Jehovah but give assistance to the remnant of the “elect” in bearing witness to the honor and name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How do they make their robes “white in the blood of the Lamb”1 The shed blood of Christ Jesus is the basis for the forgiveness of sins and the basis for God to forgive uncleanness. By believing on Christ Jesus’ shed blood as the redemptive price for believing and obedient mankind, and, based upon such belief, by consecrating themselves to do the will of God, and by serving, worshiping and obeying the Lord, and not men, these take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government and participate in the service of witnessing, and that is the only course that would give them a white and clean appearance in the sight of God. No man can take his stand on the side of Jehovah without believing in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as the means of salvation. Every human creature that obtains life must obtain it as a gift of God through Christ Jesus, and this is the only way; and all such must have their sins washed away by exercising faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. In taking the step of consecrating themselves to God by faith in the blood of Christ Jesus those who form the “great multitude” stand approved before the judgment seat of Christy and this approval of them is symbolized by the white robes which John observed that they wore. These keep their robes clean by continuing in faith and devotion to God and Christ Jesus, his anointed King, and thereby maintaining their integrity toward Jehovah God. The Lord’s “other sheep” who shall constitute the “great multitude” could therefore not come into existence until the Lord Jesus Christ appeared at the temple and began his judgment, and therefore they could not appear prior to 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They must wash up before Armageddon comes. It would be too late to wash at the time of Armageddon. They “flee into the Mountains” on seeing the totalitarian “abomination of desolation” standing in the holy place or stead of God’s kingdom, and this they do before the “winter” time, that is, the great climax of tribulation at Armageddon. (Matt. 24:16, 20) They have come out and still they come, and now together with the remnant they are singing, “Salvation to our God . . . and unto the Lamb.” They honor Jehovah God and his King, and they refuse to give any glory to any part of Satan’s organization. Those honest-hearted ones who have left Satan’s organization are now on the Lord’s side, and they want that fact to be known and they make it known, and they worship the only true God, Jehovah, and his King. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.” —Rev. 7:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mark to what extent the “great multitude” serve Jehovah: “They . . . serve him day and night.” Daytime and nighttime means all the time, and this description shows that they serve Jehovah all the time, regardless of the hours. They are not satisfied to work eight hours a day and quit on the strike of the clock and refuse to do what some call “overtime”, but are ready and respond to the call for the Lord’s active service at any time day or night. Service reports from the field in recent years fully corroborate this conclusion. Many of those who are now the Lord’s “other sheep” hear the truth one day, give themselves wholly to the Lord God, and immediately join in the field service with the remnant and are rejoicing and are anxious to do whatsoever they can. Also, these are studying with diligence the Word of God, and thus they seek meekness and righteousness, striving to obey Jehovah’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus at the temple as head of Jehovah’s capital organization or Theocratic Government now leads and feeds those who honestly put themselves under his leadership. In 1914 Christ Jesus was enthroned as King and then came to his temple in 1918, and from that time onward woe and tribulation upon the earth has continuously increased, and in that time the Devil has done all within his power to turn the people away from God and his kingdom. (See Revelation 12:12,17.) During this time of tribulation upon the earth the Lord gathers to himself those of good-will, and these, taking their stand on the side of God and his kingdom, find peace of mind and joy of heart, and these go to make up the “great multitude”. No more do they need to hunger for the truth, because the Lord feeds them from his own storehouse of truth. Multitudes of people in the earth have hungered and others do hunger for the truth. They want something different from the husks which they have been receiving from religious institutions. Learning the truth, therefore, from God’s Word, they flee to the Lord. It has been’the privilege and it is the privilege of Jehovah’s witnesses to carry this spiritual food to the hungry ones, and when such hungry ones are fed upon the truth concerning the Kingdom their joy is great and they quickly join themselves with “the remnant” to carry that message of good news to others, and thus the number of the Lord’s “other sheep” continuously increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such “other sheep” must be led by Christ Jesus and fed by him before Armageddon, and must be under his protection and be taken through Armageddon. “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:16,17) These “other sheep” follow after and with Jehovah's anointed remnant and are led ‘‘unto fountains of waters of life” (according to the Revised Version). For this reason all who are thus led shall thirst no more. No longer do they go to the dried-up waterholes of the cruel devilish system of religion, but,, by the grace of Jehovah and by the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, they are led to ‘the fountains of living waters. Upon receiving the message of truth and learning that Satan has ever reproached Jehovah’s name and that all of Satan’s servants have by fraud, deceit and false pretenses brought reproach upon God’s holy name, and that soon Jehovah will vindicate his name by and through his kingdom under Christ, the tears of these honest ones have ceased to flow, and in the place thereof joy has filled their hearts, and their faces have been made to appear glad and they have fully turned to the Lord God Jehovah. All honest creatures who see and appreciate the purpose of Jehovah by his Theocratic Government rejoice. They know that all good things and all blessings proceed from Jehovah, and thus he wipes away all their tears. The “holy city”, which is Jehovah’s capital organization or Theocracy, comes down from heaven, and now righteousness shall be established for ever, and then there shall be no more tears to those who remain in harmony with God.—Rev. 21:1-4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>CONSPIRATORS AGAINST THEOCRACY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">L</span><span class="font4">ONG ago foreshadowing modern-day events, the ancient people of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir (Edom) formed a conspiracy to destroy the typical Theocracy of Jehovah’s covenant people, the Israelites. In their effort to carry out that conspiracy, the three allies marched on the city of Jerusalem. King Jehoshaphat, in command of God’s covenant people, was warned and was instructed by Jehovah God what he must do. The combined enemy far outnumbered the Israelites and were fully equipped for war. God assured </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g Jehoshaphat and the Israelites and friendly companions with them thaj they had no occasion to fear the enemy, for the reason that the battle is God’s; and that the duty of the Israelites was to boldly march out of the city and meet the enemy, singing, as they went, the praises of Jehovah. This they did. Then the great Theocrat, Jehovah, fought their battle and the enemy was completely destroyed; and that was an example of God’s unlimited power exercised in behalf of those who love and obey him. Thus by his act Jehovah foretold what will come to pass at the battle of Armageddon in behalf of his people.—See 2 Chronicles 20:1-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now these things were our examples, ... all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Cor. 10: 6,11) Ancient Moab pictured the commercial wing of Satan’s visible organization on earth. Ammon pictured the political wing of that wicked organization. Both the commercial and political parts of the organization of Satan are supported by the military and so-called “strong-arm squad”. All of these have joined with the religionists for the purpose of doing violence to Jehovah’s servants. Their action shall not be passed over unnoticed by the great Theocrat, Jehovah. The Moabites and Ammonites were descendants of Abraham’s nephew, Lot, by his own two daughters. Therefore those people were half brothers. In the prophetic picture Moab represents the commercial big business and military elements of “Christendom”. There is never a war without the commercial element’s being at the fore and deeply interested therein; and therefore the Moabites here pictured that element that prosecutes war for revenge, for conquest, and for commercial gain, and which is one of the elements of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning Moab Jehovah mentions the reproaches that the enemies of his Theocratic Government have put upon him and his faithful servants: “I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.” (Zeph. 2:8) Moab of ancient times reproached Jehovah and his typical people, the Israelites. The modern-day Moabites, the commercial traffickers in the wealth of the earth, and in human blood, have heaped great reproach upon the name of Jehovah, and those reproaches have fallen upon the ones who love and faithfully serve the Most High and the King of his Theocracy.—See Psalm 69: 9 aqd Romans 15: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the facts fully disclose, the modern-day Moabites, that is to say, the commercial element of Satan’s visible organization, have yielded to the laws and dictates of that most powerful religious organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That wicked religious organization has repeatedly declared that Jehovah’s servants are carrying on a money-making scheme and are indulging in a campaign of hate and intolerance. They further lied saying that Jehovah’s witnesses are Communists. The commercial element accordingly, in their propaganda sheets, the daily press and magazines, continue to publish such lies against Jehovah’s witnesses, while at the same time those publications refuse to publish any true statement of the facts, even for pay. Thus it is seen that the commercial element, through their propaganda sheets and at the instance of religionists, willfully and deliberately and with malice aforethought, resist God and persecute his. servants. They continue such bitter opposition to all the publications concerning Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. They have put forth their endeavors to prevent the radio from being used to broadcast the message of The Theocratic Government. They prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from obtaining the use of public halls for their assemblies. Concerning rooming accommodations and advertising for the Jehovah’s witnesses assembly in St. Louis, Mo., in August, 1941, the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce put the “kibosh” on the whole thing; and they wrote the hotels there that they had better listen to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s advice, and hence the hotels had “everything engaged&quot;; no room for the ambassadors of The Theocratic Government. The commercial press stoops to the basest lies against Jehovah’s servants, and does so always at the instance of the Roman Hierarchy and their other religious allies, as at St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ready and willing servant of the commercial giants, who traffic in human blood and property, is the “strong-arm squad” and the military group. They continually heap reproach upon the name of Jehovah God and his servants. These servants of God they denounce as pacifists and charge that they are unpatriotic and dangerous to the security of the state. They willingly and wickedly circulate reports that the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses are subversive and should be suppressed for that reason. This commercial and military group, acting at the instance and advice of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, attempt to force upon the servants of God compulsory saluting of flags contrary to the commandment of Almighty God. The ruling powers of this world demand of Jehovah’s covenant people that they, in violation of their covenant obligations toward God, enlist and fight under the banner of such rulers; and if Jehovah’s covenant people refuse to do so they suffer imprisonment or other harsh punishment, even death. Although the law of such nations declares that a minister of the gospel shall not be required to do military service, the acting authorities who have to do with carrying the law into operation say to these faithful covenant people of God: “We do not recognize you as a minister, nor that you are a sincere, conscientious objector to engaging in war; therefore you must join the fighting forces and serve under our banner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of these things God will not forget at Armageddon. He will permit none of that commercial element of Satan’s organization to find the way of escape from execution at the hands of God’s great Executioner, Christ Jesus, at that battle. They will not be hid. This, of course, does not apply to legitimate and honest dealers in goods, wares and merchandise of necessity, but the application is to that class of commercial men who prey upon the people and use their power wickedly against mankind, and particularly against the servants of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ammonites of ancient times, who were half brothers of the Moabites, joined in the conspiracy and concerted action against Jehoshaphat, the king of the typical Theocracy at Jerusalem. The Ammonites pictured that element of Satan’s organization known as the patriotic, nationalistic politicians, who not only support but actively operate Satan’s political organization, and which is made specially manifest in the Nazis, Fascists, and other radical rulers, which carry out the persecution work of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The name “Ammon” means “inbred”. The Nazi politicians are extremists and fanatical on the “inbred” idea, priding themselves on what they call “pure Aryan blood” with not the slightest taint of Jewish blood to “defile” them. The ancient Ammonites worshiped the demongod entitled “Milcom”, which name means “their king”, or their political ruler. The Ammonites, therefore, picture this extreme, radical political element, of which the Nazis and Fascists and other totalitarians are striking examples. Because Jehovah made the Jews of ancient days his chosen people, the Nazis seize upon that pretext to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, because they declare that Jehovah is the true and almighty God. The modern-day Ammonites are allied with all other elements of Satan’s organization, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in their assault against the people of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah takes full notice of the reviling of his people by the Ammonites of modern days, this political element which works with the religionists for political gain. The totalitarians are now determined to rule the world or to bring about the destruction of the nations. They get their inspiration, of course, from the Devil by and through the religious element, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. None of these like the message of God, because it discloses that The Theocracy shall rule the whole world in righteousness and that the totalitarian rule shall soon for ever cease. These modernday Ammonites, or politicians, join forces with the Hierarchy to destroy Jehovah’s servants and to prevent the spreading of the gospel of God’s kingdom. To accomplish their wicked purpose they enact laws giving men dictatorial or arbitrary powers to enable the chief political ruler to declare an emergency when he desires and to thus justify his actions in taking away all privileges of those who love and serve the Almighty God. Thus have many of Jehovah’s witnesses been imprisoned and killed in the dictatorial countries, not for wrongdoing, but because they persist in declaring the good news of The Theocratic Government. Those enemies of God and his servants will find no hiding place at Armageddon. They will not be hid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah says of the modern-day Ammonites and Moabites: “They have reproached my people, and magnified themselves.” (Zeph. 2:8) The political and commercial elements, supported by the military and “strong-arm squad”, insist that those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah must now put the state above Almighty God and therefore “render unto Caesar” all allegiance and support. In this they bring great reproach upon Jehovah’s name and upon those who serve him. Hoping to fully control the rising generation the political, commercial and military elements, acting at the behest of the big religious group, attempt to compel the small children to salute flags, “heil” men, and engage in other ceremonies in violation of God’s law. Bent upon arbitrary rule or ruin, they go beyond all proper limits and insist that the law of the state is supreme and that the state must be obeyed under any and all circumstances. They magnify men and rulers and thus magnify and exalt themselves against God, blaspheming and reproaching his name. They shall find no way to escape the wrath of Almighty God at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pointing to the approaching enemy King Jehoshaphat said in prayer to Jehovah God: “And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not.” (2 Chron. 20:10) Thus Jehoshaphat located definitely that political, commercial and religious element combined now invading the place where God’s faithful covenant people are properly located in his service as his witnesses. In the aforementioned combine of conspirators against Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government are those mentioned prophetically as “mount Seir”, that is, the religious element of the Devil’s organization under the leadership and dominating influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority, and which people, like those of “mount Seir” in olden time, make their nests high up, like the foul birds that nested in the mountains of Seir. The Mount Seir-ites were closely associated with the Esauites or Edomites. Esau, the twin brother of Jacob, “went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. . . . Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir. Esau is Edom.” (Gen. 36:6-8) The Mount Seirites were Devil-worshipers or demon-religionists, like the Edomites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name “Edom” means “red”, and is a reminder of Esau’s failure to appreciate God’s favor toward him concerning the Abrahamic birthright, which birthright Esau sold to his brother Jacob for the paltry sum of a mess of pottage, that his selfish appetite might be appeased. “And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom [Red (marginal reading)].” (Gen. 25:30) Esau was the firstborn and apparently had the first claim to the Abrahamic birthright, but it was the will of Jehovah God that it should be otherwise. (See Genesis 22:18; 25:23-26.) The descendants of Esau, that is, the Edomites, must therefore represent a class of religious persons who are apparently the firstborn and in line for the kingdom of heaven. The Edomites more specifically stand for and represent that class of men who have organized and carried on religion in the name of God and Christ, but who in truth and in fact have been and are the representatives of the Devil, the chief of the demons, and who are hence a part of the Devil’s organization. The Edomites, the offspring of Esau, therefore clearly stand for the modern-day official religious representatives of the Devil, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, the other clergy. Those clergymen who organized and carried on the so-called “Protestant religion” are joined together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; and it has been true since the World War of 19141918 that this combined crowd has sought the death of the true followers of Christ Jesus. The clergy of the Catholic and so-called “Protestant” organizations are vigorously working together at this day to destroy the true followers of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Abrahamic birthright privileges, as set forth at Genesis 12: 3 and 22:17,18, were claimed by the religious clergy because they have always claimed to be the ones favored of God. Jehovah foreknew that they would be unfaithful and would fall away completely to demonism or religion, and therefore he foretold such in the prophecies concerning the Edomites. Jesus foretold that the Abrahamic birthright privileges concerning The Theocracy and as held out to and claimed by the religious clergy would be taken away from them because they failed to bring forth the fruits (the truth) of the Kingdom or The Theocratic Government. (See Matthew 21:43-45.) It is only the clergy that, like Esau or Edom, have tried to compete with Jehovah’s true servants for the Kingdom privileges. This corresponds exactly with Esau’s rivalry toward Jacob for the birthright of his father. Esau tried to kill Jacob, and the modern-day Edomites likewise now try to kill and destroy Jehovah’s true witnesses, pictured by Jacob. The prophecy of Obadiah shows that the modern-day religious Edomites would enter into a conspiracy against the true followers of Christ, the witnesses of Jehovah. The prophecy also refers to the two other elements of Satan’s organization, the modern-day Moabites and Ammonites, which form “the principal of the flock” of the religious clergy, and all of which are falsely called “Christians”. In the modern fulfillment of the prophecy the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied so-called “Protestant” clergymen lead in a conspiracy against God’s “hidden ones”, whom he has selected to be members of his “holy nation”, his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. The “principal of the flock”, the modern Moabites and Ammonites, have joined in this conspiracy and are now this day committing overt acts against the covenant people of Jehovah God, and against his kingdom, The Theocracy. (See Psalm 83: 3-8.) It is the Devil’s organization, pictured by Moab, Ammon and Edom, which attempts to take away from others freedom of thought, speech, assembly, and action, in the worship of Jehovah God. These worldly representatives of the Devil’s visible organization use cruel means against Jehovah’s witnesses to prevent these from telling the truth to others, which Jehovah has commanded shall be told, and they attempt to bring about the destruction of these faithful Christian men and women who do proclaim God’s truth in obedience to his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the religious-totalitarian “king of the north” combine of our day Daniel’s prophecy, chapter eleven, verse forty-one, says: “He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.” (For an explanation of this verse of prophecy see page 359 herein.) But Jehovah will not spare those three modern-day elements. Note His words to this effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’‘Concerning Edom, thus- saith the Lord of hosts; . . . Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the Lord, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.” (Jer. 49:7,17,18) “Surely Moab [the modern Moabites, the commercial traffickers] shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon [the political ruling element] as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation.” (Zeph. 2: 9) This is the judgment written against them, and that judgment will be executed at Armageddon. Destruction shall come upon them by the superhuman power, as in the case of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. As “that righteous man”, Lot, fled from Sodom and was saved from the destruction that came upon those cities, so the persons of good-will toward God and his Theocratic Government and who now flee to the place of safety he provides under The Theocracy may be saved at Armageddon. Many of these persons of good-will are now under the dominating control of the political and commercial and religious elements; but by taking their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah and his Theocracy they may escape to the place of safety. (2 Pet. 2:6-8; Gen. 19:15-29) Sodom and Gomorrah were reduced to complete desolation, from which there is no possibility of recovery; and so likewise the modern Moabites, Ammonites and Edomites shall be destroyed, and the place where they have inhabited shall be, as prophesied, “even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation.” The religious-totalitarian rule and rulers, the commercial robbers and those who have defied Jehovah God and his Theocracy, shall perish for ever at the battle of Armageddon, as the prophecy declares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER “FAYTHER O’HOOLIGAN’S” ROOMS BOYCOTT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses making return visits on people in St. Louis, Mo., area are meeting with many interesting experiences, and, among other things, this feature is very noticeable: Hundreds of the St. Louis people willingly tell these Kingdom publishers calling upon them of the fine impression they have of the witnesses that roomed with them during the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, August 6-10. Many of these people tell the publishers of the kind and comforting letters they are receiving from those witnesses who stayed with them during that convention. Some of the publishers making the back-calls find that these letters which the out-of-town witnesses were thoughtful enough to write have done much to break down misunderstanding and prejudice that existed in the minds of the people in the past, and have made it possible quite often for the publishers to place additional literature with the people and start some model studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN A NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT HOUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While I was inquiring for a man who had taken some literature from me at one time, a man on the second floor heard my conversation downstairs and came down to find out if I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Then he asked me to come to his apartment. There he showed me a Bible with many scriptures marked. He said he and his wife were studying the Bible with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> that we put out and that he and his wife wanted to become Jehovah’s witnesses. After this he told how his relatives were writing mysterious letters to them from Canada. The letters were not clear because they seemed to try to convey something and yet were not directly on any certain subject, but just said they would like to tell them something but could not write it’. Later his wife went to Canada to investigate what they would not write, and then she began to write the same way. So he went up to Canada to investigate, and he found his folks and many others had quit the Catholic chureh and were all Jehovah’s covenant people. All of them would meet quietly to study the Bible with Bible study helps. Because the mail was censored, they would not say too much in a letter. When I was making this call they had just gotten back from Canada, and they were already trying to get their friends to study the Bible and become interested in the truth. Two days after this call he and his wife went out in the service and did very well. They have already read part of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> and are very happy to learn the wonderful prospects before them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM THE PIONEER HOME, COVENTRY, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While engaging in the door-to-door work a publisher met a gentleman and his son. They had recently-moved from Coventry. While in Coventry they had regularly observed the pavement witnessing undertaken by the Coventry pioneers and company publishers. When this call was made on them they showed great interest and immediately accepted the truth with considerable enthusiasm. The son has now enrolled as a pioneer. One Sunday morning one of the pioneers was working a road. This road had been worked the previous day by mistake. He met a gentleman and commenced a model study with him. Within two weeks this man was witnessing from door to door, and at the service meeting he asked for a phonograph. He works in the Public Assistance Institution and has got right inside with the lecture recordings, a thing we had never been able to do before. He is now reaching people with the Kingdom message to whom the message had never been taken previously. Both this man and his wife are now regular publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CLERGY DEFIANCE OF SUPREME COURT RULING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here, in Biloxi, Miss., at 10: 30 a.m., while I was placing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> with two persons of good-will, a Catholic priest named Fr</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ank</span><span class="font4"> Quinn (the same person who a year ago grabbed a petition bl</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ank</span><span class="font4"> from a publisher and also had his picture taken a short time ago heckling a publisher faithfully doing his duty to the Lord) began to interfere by telling those obtaining the magazines to not do so as these were junk, trash, etc. I told him to beat it as all knew he had on the robes of Baal and he was proving it by interfering with my peaceful as well as lawful work of declaring the Kingdom to those of good-will. Upon snapping his picture, as some of us who are regular in the street work carry a camera with us, he howled, yelling to an officer on the comer across the street to arrest the person with the camera. The officer arrested me and, upon appearance at the station house, the officer was sent back to his post, the chief of police taking charge. A question was asked, 'Why was “Father” Quinn’s picture taken?’ I told chief of pqlice Aldnzo Gabrich that it was good evidence to get pictures of anyone interfering with one’s liberty. Then I told him to seal the camera as evidence in the case. The chief of po</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lice at once showed </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font4"> to be a tool dominated </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">the Hierarchy by destroying the camera, also striking me in the face with his fist as several Catholic policemen grabbed me, holding me so I could not defend myself, and the priest standing by watching. Threats to find ways or means to stop me permanently from engaging in this work were also made, the chief of police stating to another Jehovah’s witness that I was to be arrested every time I was seen on the streets with these magazines, on some charge or other, until one was found that would fit, and that maybe I would resist arrest. As no charges were pressed against me, though I was held in jail six hours with nothing to eat or drink (until brought in by friends), I was released, the-policemen doing so laughing. The priest mentioned really broke the law by disturbing the peace. We will be on the streets again Friday, armed with the ‘sword of the spirit’ and truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AMONG BOSTON’S CHINESE LAUNDRYMEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I noticed that the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font4"> had been printed in Chinese. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I ordered ten </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> in Chinese and a supply of Conspiracy booklets. In two hours’ time I placed them among the Chinese laundrymen around my home 11 had expected some results, but these were far beyond my expectation. I am now going to order a larger supply and continue this work. I think it would be a splendid idea to mention such a work to the friends, not only in the Chinese language but others. I presented </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy</span><span class="font4"> for a 25c contribution, also leaving (if they take it) an English booklet. About 50 percent of my calls I placed this combination. The literature does the talking, and very little I said. The main thing seemed to be, showing the literature.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JESUS was made human, and the mac Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Eion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan's organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>VICTORY SONG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Lo! Jehovah emptying the earth and laying it waste them who dwell therein . . . for Jehovah hath</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH inspired his prophet to tell of a vision of Armageddon which he had, and which prophetic utterance is about due for fulfillment. The prophecy discloses what will be the result of Jehovah's “strange act” upon the earth. There can be no doubt that Jehovah will do exactly as his words announce by the prophet, because “Jehovah hath spoken this word”. His word cannot return to him void, but shall accomplish his announced purpose. “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. 55:11; 46:11) But who on earth now believes what Jehovah has announced? Only those who have taken their stand firmly on the side of The Theocracy and who joyfully support that kingdom. To them Jehovah has given full assurance, and this he has done for their comfort and hope.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Not only has Jehovah given his word and repeatedly by his prophets announced his purpose to wreck Satan’s entire organization, but he has also caused many prophetic pictures to be enacted illustrating the minute details of the doing of that great act. Among such prophetic and dramatic pictures is that recorded concerning Barak and Deborah, the meaning of which is now revealed to God’s faithful people, manifestly for the reason that Armageddon is about to be fought.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The haughty, austere, and cruel and arrogant now rule the nations of the earth, because they are under the power of the demons. Each hour their wicked oppression of Jehovah’s covenant people increases. The ruling powers frame mischief by law against Jehovah’s witnesses by searching them out and then enacting unrighteous laws and wrongfully applying and enforcing such laws against the innocent. The “earth” here mentioned in the prophecy (Isa. 24:1) means the ruling powers of the earth and all those who support those ruling powers, both visible and invisible. As Jabin continuously oppressed the typical covenant people of God, so now those powers in authority on earth continually oppress the servants of Jehovah who are his covenant ^people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">; and he will overturn the face thereof, and scatter spoken this word.”—Isa. 24:1, 3, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ There are those who have made a covenant to do the will of God and who later, because of fear of man, and particularly those who rule, have declined to take any part in his “strange work” and have withdrawn themselves from activity. Such fearful and negligent ones .will not receive any protection and blessing from the Lord. The faithful and obedient ones, who do not fear men but who fear God and joyfully obey his commandments, will receive protection and blessings of the Lord Jehovah and his King. The faithful “remnant” and their true “companions”, that is, the “other sheep” of the Lord, now read the prophecies and their explanations which God has provided for them, and, so doing, they rejoice that the evidence is clear that the day of deliverance from oppression is near at hand and the day of vindication of Jehovah’s name will be the result. They have faith that God will do exactly as he has promised, including that foretold in prophetic song sung by Barak and Deborah, the consideration of which we here continue.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> “The kings came and fought; then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.” (Judg. 5: 19) The kings that wrongfully held possession of the territory in Palestine gathered together to fight against Barak and his little army of ten thousand. In reality they gathered together to fight and did fight against the Lord God. Only one king is named in the record, and that is Jabin (Judg. 4: 2, 23, 24), and he represented the Devil, the chief amongst demons, and therefore stood as representative also of all the other allied kings. There were other kings, without doubt, that came and engaged in this fight with Jabin, and they pictured also the demons; and together these kings and armies with them represented all the enemies of Jehovah. That there were other kings in the land of Palestine is certain from the Scriptural record; for instance, it is written: “The king of Taanach, . . . the king of Megiddo,” and others named at Joshua 12:9-24. All those kings and all their soldiers were demon-worshipers, and hence all against the great Theocrat, Jehovah God. Jabin alone had a great army under the command of his captain, Sisera. That army was equipped with 900 iron chariots, besides other war equipment. (Judg. 4:13) That division of the enemy crowd, together with the others that came, must have made up a tremendous host, all under the command of the demons and all pitted against Barak and his little army of ten thousand. The odds appeared to be overwhelming against Barak. Jehovah was with Barak and his little army, and Jehovah is irresistible. So shall it be at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Mark how well the corresponding activities that have come to pass at the present time constitute a fulfillment of this prophecy. The Lord foretold this in the prophecy of Revelation, to advise his people of the gathering of the worldly rulers to fight against his anointed on earth in order to prevent them from becoming a part of God’s royal organization. In this fulfillment the Devil, the chief of demons, is again in command, and the demon practitioners, that is, those who are controlled by religion or demonism, readily follow the lead of their invisible commander. Note the prophecy then relating to the present time: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”—Rev. 16:13,14,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> The prophetic song sung by Barak and Deborah gives an account of the battle at Megiddo, and which foretells the coming battle of Armageddon, and this is quite clear from the prophecies supporting the song as well as the physical facts. Armageddon means “mountain of Megiddo”, that is to say, “the mount of the assembly of troops.” The troops are those who are under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Barak, which the Lord assembles in the mountain. The ten thousand assembled with Barak in the mountain pictured all those who are faithfully and uncompromisingly supporting the Lord Jesus Christ, that is to say, who are following joyfully in his steps wheresoever he leads.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> When Sisera received the information that Barak the son of Abinoam was going up to Mount Tabor with ten thousand troops Sisera immediately began to make preparation of his army and to gather them to Megiddo for battle. (Judg. 4:12,13) No doubt that preparation on the part of the enemy was a hurried one, to which a description later written concerning the city of Nineveh is properly applicable. That description foretells preparation for the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and reads: “The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways; they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.”—Nah. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’ From the time of the temple judgment and the approval of the “remnant”, to whom Christ Jesus committed his earthly Kingdom interests called “his goods” and then sent them forth to serve, until the battle is in fact the time of preparation for the great and final conflict. (Matt. 24:45-47) Therefore in these modern times Jehovah commands this proclamation to be made throughout the land, to wit: “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles [all nations against The Theocracy] ; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about; thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, 0 Lord.” —Joel 3:9-11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> In keeping with this commandment the combined army of the enemy prepares for Armageddon and Jehovah’s mighty ones come down from heaven, and the fighting forces are made ready for the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. From the physical facts now well known it is clearly seen that the time for the great and final conflict at Armageddon is very near. The hour and the day no man on earth knows, but, to be sure, the Lord knows, because he has fixed the time definitely, and that battle will begin at the time appointed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The kings of Canaan came to fight, and they fought: “then fought the kings ... in Taanach.” There the kings started the fight and continued to fight until the Lord Jehovah performed his “strange act” by turning loose the guns of heaven upon them. Even so now the Hierarchy and their dupes and hangers-on fight against the faithful earthly representatives of The Theocracy. The demonized religionists have started the fight and are keeping it up, and will continue to do so until Jehovah opens up the heavenly forces against the enemy and performs his “strange act”. Now the covenant people of Jehovah have but one thing to do, and that is, to continuously proclaim the name and kingdom of Jehovah God, regardless of what fighting the enemy may do. This continuous service to Jehovah proclaiming his name and his kingdom must continue until the time for Jehovah to begin his “strange act”, and then there will be a real fight, which will be the last one. It will be much more than the enemy are expecting, and hence the enemy will know before it is done that it is the great Theocracy fighting by and through Christ Jesus, the King thereof, and that it is all under the command of Jehovah, the Almighty God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Deliverance to the faithful servants of Jehovah will then be complete.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> In the prophecy it is stated that the fighting was “in Taanach”. That name means “sandy soil”, and indicates that the territory was smooth and level and suitable for the use of mechanized war equipment. But when Jehovah opened the windows of heaven and threw down torrents of water and hail, the smooth, sandy land was not at all to the advantage of the mechanized war equipment. The city of Taanach was a Levite city. (Josh. 21:25,26) From its mention in the prophetic song Taanach must have been the headquarters of Sisera, which he had selected and where he maintained his base of supplies and operations. The Israelites had not driven the Canaanites out of Taanach (Judg. 1: 27, 28), and when Jabin the Second came into power he put the pressure on the Israelites and held them in subjection and oppressed them for a period of twenty years.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> The minute description of the environment of the place of battle is important, otherwise the same would not have been mentioned in the prophetic song. Says the prophecy: They fought ‘Tay the waters of Megiddo”. The city of Megiddo lay on the south of the river Kishon and about four miles northwest of the town of Taanach. It was a position of strategic importance because it commanded the mountain pass from Sharon into the valley of Esdraelon. Water from the south hills and vicinity would flow past Megiddo and empty into the Kishon river. The armies of the combined kings, which constituted a great host, were encamped in the vicinity of Megiddo and between there and Taanach, and all were under the command of Captain Sisera. The upper part of the Kishon river bed is a dry wash during most of the year, but in the rainy season the river bed is flooded. It is miles below Megiddo where the water appears in that river during the entire year. Concerning this McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia </span><span class="font6">says: “Those who have visited Megiddo and traversed its plain in the spring, after a heavy fall of rain, have found the Kishon greatly swollen, its banks quagmires, and all the ordinary roads impassable.” It is reasonable to expect that the commander of the army would station his great army on the dry land, because it was in the dry season, and therefore the fact that Sisera had his army and chariots in the vicinity of Megiddo shows that they were located south of the river bed and further proves that the river bed at that point was dry at that season of the year. It would appear to Sisera that his army was in the best possible position for the attack on the army of Israel then stationed upon the heights of Mount Tabor. Sisera would have no thought that a great flood of water would come rushing down that dry bed of the river at that dry season of the year. Sisera, being a religionist, had no faith in Jehovah God and would be utterly in the dark as to Jehovah’s purpose. While it is also true that Barak must have had no expectation of a great flood of water from heaven fighting in his behalf, yet he had faith in Jehovah God and he believed that God would fight the battle for his own people in his own good way and, having that faith, he went boldly forward. Deborah had full faith that God would deliver the enemy into the hands of Barak, and Deborah pictured God’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“Well do these details foretell the present-day conditions. All the nations of earth today have forgotten God. All the nations are religious, having chosen to serve “other gods”. The nations, including particularly the rulers, political and religious leaders, have no faith in Almighty God and his great Theocratic Government. The leading religionists read the prophecies of God and have no faith in them, and concerning the “strange act” of Jehovah these great religious leaders say: ‘When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us.” (Isa. 28:15) This proves that they have no faith in the prophecy. The religious leaders and the political rulers now stand together, the political rulers relying upon the religious leaders and the demons to keep them informed by the signs and prognostications given by men under the influence of demons. For this reason “the earth”, meaning those who control it, and the inhabitants thereof who live under their rule, are in complete darkness as to what is God’s purpose in the near future. They are not anticipating any heavenly power to act in behalf of God’s faithful people. The great flood of waters that rushed down and filled the dry bed of the river Kishon was so unusual and unexpected that Sisera and his army would regard it as a very “strange act”. Even so when Jehovah’s great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and his host of heaven fall upon the enemy host, the leaders of that host and all under it will recognize the power against them as the “strange act” of God. They will know that God’s hand is upon them, and therefore, as the prophet Ezekiel says in sixty-four different places, “they shall know that I am Jehovah.” They will find no possible way to flee.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> Jehovah had given his word to Barak, to wit: “I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude.” (Judg. 4:7) Jehovah likewise performs his word. He did exactly as he had said to Barak. Even so Jehovah has said concerning the battle of Armageddon: “The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word.”—Isa. 24: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Deborah was in the mountain with Barak and his army, and at the proper moment the prophetess gave Barak the cue, God speaking through her, to wit: “And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand; is not the Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.”—Judg. 4:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup> Immediately Barak, with his army, began the march down the mountainside to meet the enemy. Sisera’s scouts would quickly report to their captain that Barak and his army were moving down the mountain. Sisera then would set his army in motion, moving his 900 chariots and his host down to the river bed, expecting to cross that dry bed and meet Barak and his little army of ten thousand on dry and level ground and crush them out. No doubt the enemy host under Sisera was shouting a victory song before the battle began, hoping thus to frighten the Israelites. They would conclude that that little army of ten thousand could offer very small resistance, and that it would within a short time be annihilated. Their lustful eyes would be fixed on the booty soon to be in their hands. In this they were disappointed, because, it is written in the Word of God, they took no booty, and that for a good reason:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> “They took no gain of money”; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham) </span><span class="font6">“plunder of silver they took not away!” (Judg. 5:19) Sisera’s mother well pictures the Devil’s organization. She expected to have some share in the spoils that would be on hand when the battle was over; and this was shown by her language at Judges 5: 30. She was doomed to disappointment. Likewise Satan’s organization, including the many religious dupes that have fallen under the influence of the demons, expect to make a cleanup of God’s people and collect the spoils and get rid of those who are on the side of Jehovah. They also are doomed to disappointment. Jehovah made Sisera’s host a spoil to His covenant people, whom Jabin and his officers had oppressed for twenty years. In like manner God will make Satan’s entire organization a spoil at Armageddon. Those who are devoted to The Theocracy and continue faithful to the end, disregarding oppressors, “shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 39: 8-10) “For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants ; and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me.”—Zech. 2: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> The battle of Armageddon, and the spoil, is also foretold in the prophecy of 2 Chronicles 20: 25. There will be a cleanup of the enemy at Armageddon. The religious, the political (including the Vatican, the official head of the religionists on earth), and the dictators now claim the right to rule the earth and are determined to take it by force. At Armageddon Jehovah will take away from them everything, and never again shall they have anything to do with the earth or with anything else. Even the Devil himself shall consume away in due time, and, “never shalt thou be any more.”—Ezek. 28:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The prophecy records these many details concerning the battle and was written for the very purpose of giving aid, comfort and hope to the people of God now on earth who have full faith in Jehovah and who are waiting for the day of deliverance. Jehovah is certain to avenge his faithful covenant people, because he has given his word that he will do so. Jesus emphasized this great truth, and then added these words: “When the Son of man cometh, shall he find [such] faith on the earth?” (Luke 18: 8) This clearly indicates that a small number, comparatively, will have such faith. Those who practice religion do not have such faith. The “remnant” of Jehovah’s anointed people on earth do have such faith; the “other sheep” of the Lord, who shall form the “great multitude” but who are now being rapidly gathered unto the Lord, share with the remnant in that faith. These shall be avenged and, together, all these now by faith are singing the victory song and singing: “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7: 9,10) They prove their faith by the course of action taken.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.” (Judg. 5: 20) Barak had received the command from God delivered to him by God’s prophetess. To obey that command was his only course of action. Regardless of the great odds against him, he started his little army on foot down the mountainside to join battle with Sisera’s overwhelming host. That required great faith on the part of Barak; but we must have in mind that here he was performing a part of a great drama picturing Christ Jesus, who always delights to do the will of Almighty God, and who has absolute confidence that God’s Word shall be carried out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Sisera was moving his army, chariots and all, across the dry wash of the river bed. Barak’s forces were drawing near and the clash was beginning, when suddenly the host of heaven entered into the conflict. God sent a raging storm with torrential rain and hail upon the enemy army, which evidently hid from Sisera’s view Barak’s approaching forces. That great storm caused floods of water to fill the gullies, the gorges, the canyons, and the creeks, and hence a great wall of water came rushing down the bed of the river Kishon, which was usually dry. That wall of water came with a mighty and irresistible force, which completely disorganized Sisera’s army, overturned his chariots of iron, disabled his forces, and incapacitated his army for fighting. That was the almighty power from heaven exercised in behalf of God’s typical covenant people who had remained faithful to him and under the leadership of Barak and Deborah. Thus is pictured that Jehovah will exercise his almighty power in behalf of his covenant people now on earth who maintain their integrity toward him and who are under the leadership of Christ Jesus and obedient to God’s organization instructions: “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font6"> Chron. 16: 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">m “The </span><span class="font6"><sub>s</sub>t<sub>ars</sub> j<sub>n</sub> their courses fought against Sisera.” “The stars from their highways fought with Sisera.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Young)</span><span class="font6"> This might mean that in the prophetic fight there were showers of meteors falling from above and exploding with blazes of light about Sisera’s army. Probably Sisera was like the modernday dictators, who are stargazers, and had counted on the stars to guide him as to the time of mailing the assault. But they gave him no safe advice. Stargazers and astrologers are demon-controlled. When Jehovah’s “strange act” begins, all such stargazers will learn that they cannot depend upon the advice received from the demons. All such stargazers will become weary with such demon advice and counsel : “Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.”—Isa. 47:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> It is written, however, that “the stars” mentioned in this prophecy had reference to the host of heaven, invisible to human eyes, but who really did the fighting in that battle at Meggido. In the prophecies the stars fighting pictured Christ Jesus and his heavenly army. Of himself Jesus says: T, Jesus, am the bright and morning star.’ (Rev. 22:16) He is the Star that shall rule the world with irresistible power. (Num. 24:17) The faithful followers of Christ Jesus, the apostles, and others since their day who have finished their earthly course faithful unto death and who have been given a part in the “first resurrection”, are now united with Christ Jesus and they also are spoken of as “stars”. (Rev. 20: 4, 6; 1 Thess. 4:13-18) The promise to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who shall be in the Kingdom is: “He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end ... I will give him the morning star.” (Rev. 2: 26, 28) “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.” (Dan. 12: 3) “Praise him, all ye stars of light.” (Ps. 148:3) These scriptures show that “the stars” means the heavenly hosts under the command of the Greater Barak, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> This part of the prophecy is further proof given by the Most High as to what shall take place at “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. There Christ Jesus and his angels, and all his faithful servants, will fight against the enemy. The religious enemy, together with the other elements of Satan’s organization, will think the time has come when Jehovah’s servants have been completely put down, and will say, Now we are at “peace and safety”! Then, as shown by the prophecies, Christ Jesus and his glorious army will suddenly fall upon them and wipe them out, even as was done with King Jabin’s forces at Megiddo. All the influence and power of Gog and his host of Magog shall then be destroyed. Now Gog, the invisible representative of the Devil who is in command of the enemy’s forces both invisible and visible, is pushing all of his power to the destruction of The Theocracy. It is therefore certain that the hour is due when the prophecy of Jehovah shall be accomplished concerning that wicked host, as it is written: “And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God; every man’s sword shall be against his brother. And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.”— Ezek. 38:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup>’ As Deborah beheld the power of God exercised in behalf of her people and sung for joy, even so those of God’s organization on the earth, as well as in heaven, shall behold the power of the Lord against the enemy and shall sing for joy. “The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. 0 my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.” (Judg. 5:21) Before Sisera was able to get his army clear of the river bed, which was usually dry, a down-rushing of the waters upset his chariot and swept away his equipment. When Sisera began to move his army against Barak the results seemed certain in his favor. Likewise, as the Scriptures now inform God’s faithful people concerning the result at Armageddon, now it appears to the Hierarchy and allies that it will be an easy matter for them, when the due time arrives, to completely destroy God’s people. But in answer to their threats and brags it is written: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Another rendering of a part of this text is: “The torrent of olden times, the torrent of Kishon I” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> This rendering of the text appears to mean that never before, from time within memory, had the river acted like this, and no one had ever witnessed such an unseasonable flood of waters rushing down its dry bed. It was indeed a “strange act”, and likewise at Armageddon the forces there will be indeed a “strange act” to all, and particularly to those who have no faith in God. Never within the memory of man has there been anything like it. Never has there been such a trouble on earth, and never will there be again; and concerning this Jesus says: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> “The river Kishon.” These words in the prophetic song show that the river Kishon is a symbol of destruction against the enemies of The Theocracy. That river is a witness against the enemy. Another corroborative witness is the word of Jehovah, which appears as a prayer he puts in the mouth of his faithful servants now on the earth, to wit: “Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison; which perished at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, 0 Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish; that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:9,10,15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Barak and Deborah, faithful servants of God, were reminded of God’s power exercised in behalf of his people on another occasion, and so they sung to the praise of the Most High, to wit: “Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.” (Judg. 5:4) “The Christ” and all under his organization will forever sing the praises of Jehovah, having always in mind God’s great and loving kindness to those who are faithful to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>so</sup> “0 my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.” (Judg. 5: 21) These words of the prophetic song are addressed to Jehovah’s organization under Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak. This part of the prophecy shows that at Armageddon Christ and his heavenly army will tread down under foot the strong and mighty that have spoiled the earth. All the enemies of God shall then be put under foot. The strong enemies are likened unto grapes of wickedness in the wine press: “And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.”-Isa. 63:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The faithful remnant on earth and their companions, who survive Armageddon, shall see the work of the Lord and will tread upon what at one time was the strength of the enemy: “And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Alai. 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The faithful servants of Jehovah God now refuse to dishonor the Almighty God by bowing down to or saluting officials, emblems, or images, and for this they are persecuted. Jehovah’s people will remain true and steadfast in their devotion to him, and ere long the things that are now the strength of the enemy shall be trodden down. The faithful will continue to follow in the lead of Christ Jesus, their Lord and King. To them Jehovah and Christ are “the Higher Powers”, and they will give devotion to none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; “Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings [plungings], the pransings of their mighty ones.” (Judg. 5: 22) Those horses were drawing heavy chariots of iron. The terrific storm would greatly surprise and confuse the horses, causing them to stampede in terror and to plunge about in the mud and water, and which resulted in breaking their hoofs and their legs when they mired down. The horses became helpless as equipment for Sisera, although he had regarded them as great strength in his army, which would bring to him the victory. He was disappointed; and likewise the enemy shall be, because they depend on earthly power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ How about the war organizations of modern times? These are supported by the great religious institutions of the world, and upon their mechanized equipment they rely for certain victory. Religionists and other ruling elements think their equipment is irresistible. Those mighty ones scorn The Theocracy and boast of their ability to destroy everything that is faithful to Almighty God. The prophecies show they will be greatly dismayed when the Lord begins to fight against them. Their horses and their mechanized equipment will be of no value. Paralyzed with fear, they will be unable to offer effective resistance. The enemy will be thrown into great panic and will find no way of escape, but will be completely destroyed. Another prophecy, describing the confusion of the enemy, says: “At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands.”—Jer. 47:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Jehovah has given his word that at Armageddon he will empty the earth of everything and every creature that is in opposition to The Theocracy. He causes these truths to be proclaimed now in advance that those who desire to hear may hear, and he causes his name to be heralded throughout the earth in order that those who have the desire to put themselves on the side of The Theocracy, seek righteousness and learn the way to life, may do so. He compels no one to take this course, but he leaves the way open to all who voluntarily and freely come out and make known that they are on the side of Jehovah and his government of righteousness. But how about those who hear the message and yet remain silent, indifferent, and negligent, concluding that they had better keep quiet in order to make the way of the present time easier for themselves? Can one who now hears the name of Jehovah, and understands that his final reckoning is near at hand, remain quiet, indifferent or negligent concerning the same and expect to receive protection from Jehovah? The prophetic song of Deborah and Barak gives answer to these questions: “Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord; curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.”—Judg. 5: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” It appears that Meroz was a settlement of the Israelites. Under their covenant they were dutybound to obey the commandment given them and to support their brethren. The tribes of Reuben, Dan, Gad and Asher failed to answer the call to arms, and in this pictured all those in a covenant with God who have failed or neglected to do their duty. The title “Meroz” is of uncertain meaning. Here is the only place it is mentioned in the Bible. Seeing that a curse is pronounced upon Meroz, the word may properly apply to all in the tribes that failed or neglected or refused to do their duty under Barak. Only one example would be necessary to make known God’s rule concerning those who are negligent, indifferent and fearful. Note the words of Jehovah in another prophecy: “Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(marginal reading)</span><span class="font6"> negligently], and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.”—Jer. 48:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> When a person enters into a covenant with Jehovah he is bound to perform the terms of that covenant. All the tribes of Israel were bound by the terms of their covenant to perform their duty. Likewise all today who are in a covenant to do the will of God cannot with impunity fail or neglect to perform. As opportunity to perform is given that performance must be forthcoming. When there is difficulty between the nations of earth God’s people have no part therein and properly remain neutral; but when God commands his covenant people to do certain things they must perform their duty toward his covenant people. He has commanded all such to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”, to declare his name and his kingdom throughout the earth, and there is no excuse to fail or refuse to do so. The curse pronounced against Meroz, without doubt, refers to the iniquities and indifference of some of the consecrated at the present time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“ Jehovah’s angel pronounced the curse in the name of Jehovah, which proves that Jehovah’s invisible representative was present and in command of the heavenly forces that fought the battle: “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.” Doubtless that angel of the Lord who pronounced the curse on that occasion was the Lord Jesus in his prehuman existence, that is, ‘Michael, the great Prince which stands for the children of the people’ and who is in charge of the forces of Jehovah, and will be at the battle of Armageddon. (Dan. 12:1) The same angelic captain was in command of the battle of Jericho and said to Joshua: “Nay; but as captain of the host of [Jehovah] am I now come.” “And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?”—Josh. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” “Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof.” (Judg. 5:23) Those upon whom the curse was pronounced were seeking their own salvation, ease and comfort, and avoiding service. They said in their hearts: ‘Let others do the work.’ By that course they will doubtless escape some persecution and hardship, but negligence in the performance of duty will bring upon them God’s curse. The rules, or law, of Jehovah change not. Therefore the conclusion is irresistible that if a person enters into a covenant to do the will of God he must, in order to receive God’s approval, perform that covenant obligation to the best of his ability.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> “Because they came not to the help of the Lord . . . against the mighty.” (Judg. 5:23) Jehovah himself did not need any help; but his commissioned servants, Deborah and Barak, did need help against the mighty host of their oppressors who were defaming the name of the Almighty God. Help rendered unto Barak and Deborah was as rendered unto Jehovah, and in rendering such help the Israelites were bound to render the same thing, not as unto man, but as unto God. (Col. 3: 23, 24) Such is exactly the rule announced by Jesus as to the sheep and the goats. “Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”—Matt. 25: 45, 41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Today the foes of The Theocracy are mighty. This is a day in which the name of Jehovah must be declared throughout the earth and The Theocracy advertised. All persons who have made a covenant to do the will of God are obligated by the terms of that covenant to obey the commandments of the Lord. No one has been compelled to enter into that covenant, but, one having once entered in, performance is required. It will not do to wait until the foes have been stripped of their power at Armageddon. The “strange work” of Jehovah has been in progress now for some time, and it appears the conclusion of that work is near. Now is the time when all the covenant people of God must present a solid front against the enemy and each and every one do his part in declaring the name and the kingdom of the Most High. When the actual battle of Armageddon begins there will be no need for volunteers or for faithful work in declaring Jehovah’s name. That work will be completed and the powers of heaven will do the real fighting; as Jehovah has stated: ‘For the battle is not yours, but God’s; and ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, and stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you.’—2 Chron. 20:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> In that fight Christ Jesus, the Captain of Jehovah’s host, will completely empty the earth of all opponents of The Theocracy, and while that great invisible army is doing the fighting the faithful of God’s organization on earth will be singing praises of the Most High and of his King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4&gt;</sup> Today the Lord is gathering his “other sheep” unto himself. Many are hearing the message and believing it to be the truth, and by word of mouth they declare themselves on the side of Jehovah and his King. From the prophecy it would appear that some of these will fail to fully appreciate and perform their duty, and will find themselves with the goats. All such as fail stand out in marked contrast with Jael’s conduct, which the Lord emphasizes in the prophetic song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{To be continued)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>WHO WILL BE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">ODAY darkness as to understanding the purpose of the Supreme Ruler covers the rulers of this visible organization on earth, and gross darkness is upon the people subject to that organization. The darkness will persist until the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fifteen centuries before Christ a plague of literal darkness that could be felt covered the land of Egypt for three days, except where the oppressed Jews dwelt. It was the ninth in a series of sore, vexing plagues, which served as warning notice from Almighty God of coming destruction upon those who opposed his purpose and oppressed his covenant people. For the tenth time Moses, accompanied by Aaron his brother, appeared before Egypt’s ruler, Pharaoh. Selfishness had hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he defiantly refused to let the enslaved people of Jehovah God go forth into freedom. “And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.”—Exodus 10:27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the historical record it appears that while Moses was still in Pharaoh’s presence God spoke to Moses to give final warning to Pharaoh before he departed. “And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.” (Ex. 11:1) Moses withdrew from Pharaoh never again to communicate with or to see Pharaoh except upon the request of the latter. That request was made shortly. Fear had now seized upon Pharaoh and his official household, and they were anxious to be quit of God’s “messengers of misfortune”.—Ex. 12:31-33; Psalm 78:49, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time it appears that warning notices upon “Christendom”, like those nine plagues upon ancient Egypt, have been served by Jehovah’s witnesses at his command and under his direction, which messages of truth are still continuing and are great plagues upon the religious and totalitarian rulers of the world and their supporters.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>PASSED</span><span class="font7"> OVER?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">These messages of notice and warning constitute a great plague like a nightmare to the official element of the world, Satan’s organization, which would be glad to be rid of these to them “pestiferous” witnesses of Jehovah. This is made manifest by the constant howls that go up from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen, big radio preachers, and others of like stripe who cry for “more religion” and who demand that God’s messengers be forbidden an opportunity to use the facilities of the world for proclaiming the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses are now thoroughly hated by all such opposers, and they would find some apparently legal excuse to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. There is still some witness work to be done amongst the people, and preparation is now being made for the final plague to be visited upon Satan’s organization at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah had previously told Moses that, when His due time came for the deliverance of the Israelites, “ye shall not go empty,” but that the Israelites who had served as slaves many years without pay should borrow from the Egyptians: “And ye shall spoil the Egyptians ” (Ex. 3: 21, 22) Immediately following this ninth plague Jehovah spoke to Moses and said: “Speak now m the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.” “And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.” (Ex. 11:2,3) The borrowing of articles from the Egyptians was not merely for self-adornment, but for use in the service of the Lord by the Israelites. This seems to mean that today, when Jehovah’s witnesses are falsely accused of carrying on a commercial work because they accept small contributions from persons of good-will for the literature left with them, it is right and proper now for Jehovah’s witnesses to apply for and to use any and all of the facilities that the worldly rulers now control and to use such in order to further the witness work of the Kingdom. That means that Jehovah’s witnesses are to use the enemy’s own means or instruments against them, such as radio stations, telephone lines, the facilities of the courts, the making of petitions and protests, the lawmaking bodies, the right to use which is guaranteed by the fundamental law of their own land, and thus by the use of any and all other means bring to the attention of the people the message of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. By thus doing they are not asking permission of Satan’s organization to do something, but they are serving notice upon his organization and demanding that this worldly organization shall cease interfering with the execution of God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The borrowing from the Egyptians would also include receiving by Jehovah’s witnesses of money in the way of contribution for the literature, and then using that money in the preparation and publication of more literature. Thus the Lord’s people are diverting some things from the Devil’s crowd into the Lord’s work and service. This is further and conclusive proof that Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a commercial enterprise, such as hawking and peddling and bookselling, regardless of what the worldly tribunals may decide or determine, and certainly regardless of what the religious clergy and their crowd may say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Egypt preparation must be made and was made for the final plague, and at the same time for the protection of God’s people. Pharaoh and his official family had spurned and disregarded the notice of warning of the nine preceding plagues, and hence it would have been useless to give Egypt’s rulers any instruction concerning the passover protection; and none was given to them. It appears, however, from the record at Exodus 11: 5-10, that Moses plainly warned Pharaoh that all his firstborn should die, but not even a dog’s tongue would move against any of the Israelites, and this warning was given to Pharaoh before Moses withdrew from his presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah told Moses that the death of the firstborn would take place at midnight, this to mean, in the modern-day fulfillment, at a time of the world’s blackness or darkest period. The blackness of darkness is now upon the world, and must continue until Armageddon. At the command of Jehovah Moses prepared the Israelites by instructing them that each household should, on the tenth day of the first month. Nisan (corresponding to our April), take a lamb without spot or blemish and keep it up until the fourteenth day of that month, on which day, in the evening, the lamb should be killed and its blood sprinkled over the entrance into each house and all should go into the house and remain there during the night, roast the lamb whole without breaking a bone, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and while thus doing they should be fully equipped for travel, God saying to them: “It is Jehovah’s passover.” “For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.</span><span class="font4"> And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” —Ex. 12:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The record then follows: “And [Jehovah] smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham.&quot; (Ps. 78: 51) “He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.” (Ps. 105: 36) “And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.”—Ex. 12: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the fulfillment of this prophetic drama in our time the final plague upon the world will be at Armageddon. Who constitutes the antitypical or modern-day firstborn? God’s law, at Deuteronomy 21:17, declares that the firstborn son “is the beginning of his strength”. The antitypical Pharaoh is the Devil, and he has children. Said Jesus: “The tares [religionists] are the children of the wicked one.” (Matt. 13:38) And to the religious leaders of that day Jesus said: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.” (John 8:44) The firstborn of Egypt would therefore picture all of Satan’s children, that is, those of his earthly organization who are “the beginning of his strength”, namely, the chief of the strength of the organization, to wit, the leaders and chief ones in the religious, commercial and political branches of Satan’s visible organization. Back there, the firstborn of every portion of Satan’s organization was destroyed. This in the antitypical fulfillment means that religious crowd known as the “man of sin” and “the son of perdition”; also the so-called “strong-arm squad” which they use to do the violent work for them, such as the German gestapo; and also those who put forth their strength to carry forward Satan’s schemes, and also the counterfeit of God’s kingdom, namely, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Totalitarian combine and its “new world order”. In this day Satan makes war upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, who are of the “church of the firstborn”, and would destroy them unless prevented from so doing by the power of the Lord God. The only protection that these faithful witnesses have is from the Lord, and this comes by reason of their obedience to Jehovah’s commandment given to them by the Greater Moses, who is Christ Jesus, according to Acts 3:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The slaying of the passover lamb, and the eating thereof by the Israelites, preceded the slaughter of Egypt’s firstborn. At 1 Corinthians 5:7 it is written: “For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” As in the typical events in Egypt, even so the death of “Christ our passover” and the partaking of the merit of his sacrifice by his spirit-begotten followers precede the slaughter of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. As Israel’s firstborn were passed over and preserved on that fateful night, even so the faithful remnant of anointed witnesses, who are of Jehovah’s “firstborn”, will be passed over and preserved at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. They will survive Armageddon by virtue of Jehovah’s protection. With them a great number of “companions”, persons of good-will known as the Lord’s “other sheep”, will survive. These were pictured by the “strangers” among the Israelites who were circumcised in order that they might eat the passover with the Israelites, and who formed a “mixed multitude” that went up with the Israelites out of Egypt. (Ex. 12: 38, 44, 48, 49) This “great multitude” of “other sheep” will be passed over at Armageddon because they abandon Satan’s worldly organization before Armageddon and associate themselves with the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses and with them take part in serving notice on Satan’s organization and in preaching the good news of The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. (John 10:16; Rev. 7:9-17) To them the prophecy (Zephaniah 2:3) now speaks: &quot;Seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The typical passover lamb was taken into the houses of the Israelites on the tenth day of Nisan. Fifteen hundred years later, on the tenth day of Nisan, A.D. 33, Jesus “the Lamb of God” rode into Jerusalem and offered himself as King to the Jews. This shows that now, since the parallel date of A.D. 1918, the Christian’s receiving of the Lamb into the house signifies far more than accepting Jesus merely as the ransom sacrifice or as “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. (John 1:29) It now means in this present “day of Jehovah” since 1918 to receive the Lamb which was slain, receiving him as Jehovah’s King enthroned in office, and hence the receiving the Kingdom and undertaking the full responsibility of increasing the interests of the Kingdom. In this “day of Jehovah” the eating of the Lamb would include not only partaking of his sacrificial merit, which cleanses from sin, but also the having a share in the doing of the witness work which Jesus Christ was sent to earth to do, to wit, to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah, all to the vindication of his holy name. Furthermore, as pictured by the removal of all leaven at passover time, there must be no uncleanness among the people of God’s organization and resulting from coming in contact with the Devil’s organization or compromising with it. There must also be no “leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy”; meaning to profess to be a Christian and then fail or refuse to confess the Lord as Savior and reigning King before men. (See Exodus 12: 8,10,15-17; Luke 12:1; 2 Corinthians 6:16-18.) Jehovah’s witnesses and the “great multitude” of their companions must now be entirely separate from Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were required to be in haste as they ate the passover, with their loins girded, feet shod, and staff in hand, which antitypically means that, “as strangers and pilgrims,” Jehovah’s witnesses are not of this world nor subject to Satan’s organization and its demands against The Theocracy, but are subject to the Theocratic “Higher Powers”; and that they are on the trek and about to leave the antitypical Egypt, seeing that that wicked organization will shortly be destroyed at Armageddon. (Ex. 12:11) At the passover the Israelites must abide in the house, under the blood which was sprinkled on their doorposts and lintels, and until morning. Antitypically this means that Jehovah’s witnesses are now hidden and are kept “in the secret place of the Most High”, under the protection of Jehovah God and His Vindicator, Christ Jesus, and are thus protected “until the indignation be overpast”. By the Lord’s grace, they have entered there and have ‘shut the door behind them’.—See Exodus 12: 22; Psalm 91:1; and Isaiah 26: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blood of the passover lamb was publicly sprinkled on the doorposts and lintels of the houses of the Israelites. Antitypically that not only means that one must make public confession of the blood of Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s provided redemptive price for mankind, but also signifies to Jehovah’s witnesses that all of that class are spiritually Judeans, that is, praisers of Jehovah, and are subject to the orders of Jehovah’s Vindicator and Great High Priest, Christ Jesus, who is the Prophet greater than Moses. Further, that sprinkled blood on the doorposts and lintels signifies that the day of judgment or of the vengeance of God is here, which vengeance will shortly be expressed and exercised in the destruction of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. Therefore the blood was both a public declaration and a testimony of the approaching destruction upon Jehovah’s enemies. This truth Jehovah’s witnesses, who are His “firstborn”, of the “church of the firstborn”, and who are yet on earth, must declare, because it is an expression of his vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that the blood sprinkled signifies that those under it say, “I accept Christ Jesus’ blood as my redemptive price.” But to the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses it means much more. Back in Egypt the blood of the passover Lamb validated or made operative the law covenant which Jehovah made with the Israelites through their mediator Moses. The blood of Christ Jesus validates the new testament or new covenant. Hence the blood on the doorposts picturing the blood of the Victim which validates this new covenant, it signifies that the remnant of God’s firstborn have entered into that new covenant. The primary purpose of that covenant is to bring forth or produce a people for Jehovah’s name and which will have a part in the vindication of that holy name. Upon this remnant The Most High God has bestowed a “new name”, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” thus showing them to be a “people for his name”. (Read Isaiah 62:2; Revelation 2:17; and Acts 15:14.) The blood on the door entrances would therefore picture that the new covenant has been inaugurated toward the remnant and that hence they must be faithful to the “new name” which Jehovah has given them, and hence must continue to faithfully bear testimony to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">April 11,1941, is the anniversary of the night that Jesus celebrated the last passover with his disciples and thereafter took bread and wine and set up the Memorial of his own death; and that date marks the celebration publicly of the Lord’s supper by Jehovah’s witnesses. We are now in the day of Jehovah, when the plagues which of old came upon Egypt are being antitypically fulfilled upon Satan’s world. Now the celebration of the Memorial means much more than it did prior to the coming of the Lord to the temple in 1918 to judge his followers and to divide the nations as sheep and goats prior to Armageddon. Those who now properly partake of or celebrate the Lord’s supper as a memorial to the name of Jehovah and to his sacrificed Lamb must have an active personal part in the performance of the ten antitypical plagues upon antitypical Egypt, that is, upon Satan’s organization. By this is meant that each one must participate in proclaiming the message of Jehovah God in connection with these plagues. The plagues are now in operation, advancing to the great climax of destruction of Satan’s firstborn at Armageddon. To partake worthily of the Memorial one must have a part in declaring these truths as Christ has commanded. It was Moses and his brother Aaron who declared God’s word to the Egyptians, which resulted in the plagues. Moses was a type of Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus Aaron, associated with Moses as his spokesman, represented the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth, declaring the message of God’s vengeance and bearing testimony of his kingdom, The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses at the temple of judgment are instructed by the Lord Jesus and then sent forth to declare the message of truth pertaining to the antitypical plagues. It follows, then, that those who worthily partake of the Memorial must be “in Christ” as members of “his body” and hence be of the heavenly capital organization of Jehovah They must be “living stones” in the temple of which Christ Jesus is the Chief Comer Stone. They must be wholly devoted to God and be engaged in proclaiming the mighty name and works of the Most High, for the reason that, as written in Psalm 29: 9, “in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” The Lord’s “other sheep”, who become the “great multitude”, may engage in proclaiming the message of the kingdom of God, but it is those who partake of the death of Christ Jesu^ as members of “his body” who are the ones that ultimately live with him in heavenly glory. Those who also suffer the reproaches that reproached him by reason of his being Jehovah’s “faithful and true witness”, even unto the end, are the ones that will ultimately reign with him in the kingdom of heaven. (2 Tim. 2:11,12) The “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep” will abide on earth and will dwell forever in peace and happiness under The Theocratic Government. To Jesus Jehovah gave the privilege and honor of being his vindicator at the cost of his human life. All who are with Him in that vindication must likewise die sacrificially, as Jesus stated, faithful unto the end. All such of Jehovah’s capital organization are “one bread and one body”, and the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup show forth that all who do so properly are one with Christ Jesus, that is to say, in unity with him as members of his body and therefore in the temple. (Read 1 Corinthians 10:16,17.) Such, therefore, properly partake of the emblems of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The primary purpose of Jehovah is the vindication of his own holy name which has been pushed aside and misrepresented and reproached by Satan the Devil and his organization, including “Christendom”. That is why God sent Moses to Egypt. For that same reason he sends Jesus to the world. All things else are incidental to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The “day of Jehovah”, beginning in A.D. 1914 when the Times of the Gentiles ended, marks the time when Christ Jesus was placed upon his throne and sent forth to rule amid his enemies in heaven and earth. Three and one-half years thereafter, corresponding to the three and one-half years of the earthly ministry of Jesus in the flesh, to wit, in A.D. 1918, the Lord Jesus comes to the temple for judgment and judgment begins, first with his consecrated followers and then with professing “Christendom”. Then follows the antitypical fulfillment of the plagues upon Egypt, which plagues are completed at Armageddon in the destruction of Satan’s firstborn. The Scriptures seem clearly to show that the firstborn of Egypt represent the visible part of Satan’s organization, which will be destroyed at the battle of Armageddon, and that the invisible part of his organization, the wicked demons, including Satan himself, will shortly thereafter be destroyed, when Satan shall be cast into the pit of destruction. (Compare Revelation 19:19-21 and 20:1-3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the remnant of those who are in Christ as members of “his body”, and also their “companions”, the “great multitude”, who are the ones passed over at Armageddon. These are passed over upon condition that they are faithful to Jehovah and to Christ Jesus, the King of His Theocratic Government, and are obeying God’s commandments This means that they must perform the service of bearing testimony before the world rulers and before the people of and concerning The Theocratic Government and also declaring the vengeance of our God against Satan’s organization. When this declaration is completed, then will follow the execution of the tenth and final plague at Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WOUNDED HEAD HEALED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE head is the member that directs the course of action of the body, and hence refers to the ruling part. Thus the head is symbolically used to represent a world power. The Bible calls attention to seven world powers. The history of the world shows seven separate and distinct world powers which have in their respective order held a place of supremacy on the earth. These world powers are, to wit, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome and Anglo-American imperialism. Such world powers have adopted the emblems of wild, voracious animals as symbols of their strength and fierceness, and of their power to destroy the opposers. These world powers have frequently fought against one another. The prophetic book of Revelation, chapter thirteen, symbolically describes such a fight. Jehovah God gave the visions of that book with the purpose that those who love righteousness should understand Revelation at some time. The time has come for them to understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The eye-witness writes: “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon [the god of this world] gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads, as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. . . . the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” —Rev. 13:1-3,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “sword”, which is an implement of war, clearly refers to the World War beginning in A.D. 1914. The physical facts of history make it rather easy to locate this head that appeared to be wounded unto death. Revelation does not state who inflicted the wound, but the presumption must be indulged that it was inflicted by another head or world power of the “wild beast”, since that beast is represented as having seven heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sixth world power, to wit, the Roman, had survived up to A.D. 1914, with Germany for some years prior to that date as the chief one in that empire. Originally Rome was pagan. Later it became papal and was misnamed “Christian”, and also misnamed “The Holy Roman Empire”. The dominant race in the “Holy Roman Empire” was Teutonic or German. This is particularly shown in the fact that the title given to the empire was “Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation”. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. 12, page 511.) Germany was the head or pre-eminent part of the Teutonic peoples, and therefore the controlling part of the sixth head of the “beast”, and particularly so in 1914. Germany created and became the head of the alliance, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dreibund,</span><span class="font4"> composed of Germany, Austria and Italy, and thus the sixth world power continued, with Germany as the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Britain became the seventh dominant world power, with England as the head thereof. Both these world powers and “heads” were in existence in 1914, and are still in existence, and both form part of the “wild beast” that came up out of the symbolic “sea” of mankind alienated from Jehovah God. Such was the exact condition that existed in 1914 at the beginning of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Says </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. 12, page 521: “Europe was, for many years before the actual eruption of 1914, practically divided into two hostile camps, with France, England and Russia on the one side and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dreibund</span><span class="font4"> on the other, thus paralyzing all efforts of the nations to live in hearty concord, a thoroughly unhealthy state of things, one breeding all around distrust and hatred and rendering impossible harmony. Of course, there had been many seeing eyes in Germany herself which discerned clearly the abnormal features in the above, features threatening perpetually the peace of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1914 the “beast” which did “rise up out of the sea” got into a fight, its heads fighting each other. Germany the head on the one side and Britain the head on the other side led the fight. Every nation involved in that war was and is a part of the “beast”. That World War resulted in a terrible punishment to Germany and her allies, and it looked for some time as though Germany was completely done for. This harmonizes with the apostle John’s statement: “And I saw one of his [the beast’s] heads, as it were wounded to death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The John or servant class of the Lord on earth who witnessed the fulfillment of this prophecy thought for some time that it was literally true that Germany was done for. To many it seemed impossible for Germany ever to recover. Then, in the same connection, John says: “And his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.”—Rev. 13: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Germany in particular was a very sick nation. She continued to linger and her people suffered; and lingering, she did live. The Devil’s own organization, after the war, began to put forth efforts to clean off the wounded head and bind it up and heal it. A real financial effort to heal this condition began at the Geneva Conference in the spring of 1922. Later the plan was submitted which provided that a loan of two hundred million dollars be made to Germany by the other nations forming a part of the symbolic “wild beast”. The British quota for this loan was oversubscribed in three hours, and the American bankers sold their portion in fifteen minutes. An encouraging survey of the first two years of the operation of this plan and of conditions in republican Germany was published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Current History</span><span class="font4"> of March, 1927, under the title “Germany’s Restoration”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Says </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Ajnericana,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. 28, page 645: “A day of happy promise dawned on 10 Sept. 1926 when Germany was received into the League of Nations ‘amid scenes of European reconciliation, which in their fire of enthusiasm have been unexampled since the Armistice Germany and France, through their Foreign Ministers, Dr. Gustav Stresemann and Aristide Briand, committed themselves to perpetual peace, and solemnly engaged the honor of their nations henceforth never to draw the sword, but to settle disputes by arbitration or compromise’.” The 1934 Annual of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Americana</span><span class="font4"> (pages 270,272) adds “Momentous social and political changes characterized the year 1933 in Germany. On 30 January, Adolf Hitler, fiery leader of the National Socialists (Nazis) became Chancellor. His first cabinet included ex-chancellor von Papen as Vicechancellor and many of the most conservative and largest capitalist elements in Germany. . . . Late in June von Papen visited the Pope seeking a new concordat for the whole of Germany and bespeaking the influence of the Pope to have the German Catholics abandon their political organizations and place themselves in line with the new Germany.” On October 14, 1933, Hitler, for Germany, quit the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. On March 16, 1935, he proclaimed the renewal of military conscription in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophetic Scriptures declared, and Jehovah’s witnesses particularly since 1930 called attention thereto, that the vanquished side would come back, with the head healed, and that all the nations would be astounded. Germany was for many years the chief support of Papal Rome, and the dominant people in the “Holy Roman Empire”. The Roman Catholic “Hierarchy of Authority”, operating from Rome, is admittedly in the lead of all religious organizations on the earth and carries forward what it calls “Catholic Action”, operating always for a wicked purpose The present pope is undoubtedly the most astute politician that has occupied the papal office in many centuries. He was secretary of state during the administration of Pius XI, when Hitler came to power. The purpose of the Vatican in its movement called “Catholic Action” is to gain control and rule the world, and, to do that, it demands the re-establishment of the old “Holy Roman Empire”. The totalitarian dictators accede to his demand and proceed in the establishment of Rome on its old basis. Catholic Action began in Germany to bring about the healing of that German head that was wounded. The nations and the people are now advised of the result. Hitler was put in power as dictator by the connivance and allied action of the religious politicians of various nations of the earth, many of whom were members of the League of Nations. The religious, political, commercial elements furnished the brains and the money to put Hitler into office, but the whole scheme originated with and was directed by Satan himself. Much of the support to put Hitler in power came from the United States. Now the work of re-establishing the old “Holy Roman Empire” is well under way. Now the dictators, backed up by the Vatican, spread out over the earth and are grabbing everything on the earth. The head of that “beast” that received the deadly wound was healed, and the Papacy is riding on the back of that beast. So completely does the Vatican control that beast, aligned with the politicians and commercial leaders, that the newspapers and other publications of the world, even in lands yet called “democratic”, refuse to speak out and tell the people that the real enemy that is destroying liberty and all freedom of thought and action is that religious organization operating from Vatican City in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ruling factors of the beastly organization boast that according to their own pattern they will establish everlasting peace on earth. Long ago the Lord God directed John to describe this condition, at Revelation 13:4: “And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?” The course of the ruling factors, and particularly the religious clergy, is a defiant challenge to Almighty God and to Christ Jesus, the King of his Theocratic Government. They raise the issue, Who is supreme ? and how will the world be ruled ? God’s anointed witnesses on earth are telling the people that God’s kingdom is here and is the complete relief for humankind. Satan’s visible organization on earth now says: ‘We will establish the world, and none can war with us.’ Thus they induce the people to worship the Devil and the “beast”, which is Satan’s visible organization. Seemingly they are totally blind to the fact that they are marching on to Armageddon and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verse 5 reads: “And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.” Satan is the arch blasphemer against Jehovah God. He is the great deceiver of the people. The religious clergy in particular proclaim their doctrines that turn the people away from Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ, and these are Satan’s mouthpieces. They now misrepresent God’s Word and claim that the “wild beast” will make lasting peace, whereas the Scriptures show that there can be no peace until the “wild beast” is completely destroyed, at Armageddon by Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verses 6 and 7 add: “And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” This is further proof that the “wild beast” includes all the nations of the earth, and particularly ‘•Christendom”. During the World War (1914-1918) and since have the ruling factors blasphemed God and those who faithfully hold to the Word of God. God’s “tabernacle” or tent is among his covenant people, his witnesses, and he dwells there; and those ill-using his witnesses because they testify concerning God’s kingdom do thereby reproach and blaspheme God’s holy name. To be sure, Jehovah could prevent this; but he does not, doubtless withdrawing his restraining power for a time to give the religious clergy and their allies a full opportunity to demonstrate to what extent they would go in beastliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the beast], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Rev. 13:8) The line of demarkation is clearly drawn between Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and that of the enemy, and this before the end of Satan’s organization comes Faith in the blood of Christ, the Lamb of God, and in the Theocratic Government of which he is King, is the only way that man can ever get life everlasting. All the people that dwell upon the earth and that do not trust in the sacrificial blood of Christ Jesus and in Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ will be lined up on the side of Satan and his organization before the final end at Armageddon The Lord God is causing the message of his kingdom to be widely proclaimed for the manifest purpose of informing mankind of God’s purpose to grant life to those who devote themselves to the Lord; and those who do not take their stand on the Lord’s side and give him the honor and glory due, do by their contrary course give honor and worship to the “beast”, or Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence verse 9 adds: “If any man have an ear, let him hear.” This is clearly a warning to all who have made a consecration of themselves to God to do his will, and indicates a test to all “that hear the words of this prophecy”. (Rev. 1:3) Who will be on the Lord’s side? The words “let him hear” also show an obligation resting upon Jehovah’s anointed witnesses to carry this message to those who are held as virtual prisoners by the beastly organization of the Devil, particularly by the religious organizations on earth, that thus such ones may have no excuse for not taking their stand on the side of Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus. Let those who love the Lord God stand firm on his side and faithfully and earnestly proceed with the proclamation of the message of his Theocratic Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In A.D. 70 the “wild beast” that came up “out of the sea” used the armies of Rome to destroy Jerusalem and led the Jews, who were God’s typical people, into the captivity of the nations, as Jesus had foretold at Luke 21 24 In 1918 the same “wild beast” led Jehovah’s people, the spiritual Israelites, into captivity to the powers of this world and killed the witness work they were carrying on From and after 1919 Jehovah began to deliver his witnesses from this captivity. The same beast still holds in captivity many persons of good-will toward Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government. At Revelation 13, verse ten, the Lord prescribes the punishment upon those of Satan’s organization ■ “He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” The one that shall lead the “beast” into captivity is Jehovah’s great Priest and Executive Officer, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “wild beast”, acting through its head the Roman Empire, “killed with the sword” James the brother of the apostle John. In A.D. 70 that “beast” caused the Jews to fall by the sword, and in 1918 by the sword of the World War it killed the witness work of Jehovah’s people Hence that beast “must be killed with the sword” at Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1918 a great trial came upon God’s people Ever since it has been a trial of patience and faith, even as Jesus had foretold, at Matthew 24: 9,13. It means that Jehovah’s witnesses and their devoted companions must continue in patience and faith and love even unto the end. Complete devotion to God and faithfully giving witness to his name and kingdom according to his commandments are required. Victory will be given to the faithful.—Rev 2 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIDEWALK MAGAZINE-WORK EPISODES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Omak, Washington: “Last Saturday afternoon two pioneers and a publisher from Okanogan went on the street with the magazines. As it was quite cold we planned on staying just one hour. After a few minutes there one of the dupes of the Hierarchy asked if we would salute the flag. We asked, Upon whose authority do you ask this question! He quickly turned away with an angry retort, 'I’ll show you whose authority!’ He busied himself up and down both sides of the street going in to all the stores inviting the people to come out and look at Jehovah’s witnesses who would not salute the flag. In a few minutes down comes the constable, asking, ‘Will you salute the American flag!’ ‘No!’ was the reply. Constable: ‘I will give you ten minutes to get out of town!’ Troublemaker, standing behind the constable, after these words says: 'That’s the way to tell them, officer.’ We held down our corners and a few minutes before it was time to leave the mayor himself came up and said we had better leave, as the town was getting very angry. We told him we had work to do and were staying on the street for the hour we had planned. He stated there was an ordinance against this sort of work here. I asked if I could have a copy of it, and he said, ‘Yes, get it at the City Hall.’ We still serve the Lord and believe in the American Constitution, which guarantees freedom of worship according to the dictates of your conscience. We will be back with the magazines next Saturday afternoon in Omak, by the Lord’s grace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pontiac, Michigan: ‘‘Last Saturday I stood on the street with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> and a man came up to me and said: T)o you people know that there are many Catholics who are thinking about what Jehovah’s witnesses have told them and are wondering if you people are right!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Petersburg, Florida: “A man in the business district called me to his office and advised me to stop this work because someone would surely kill me. This furnished me an opportunity to give him further witness: ‘Many people misunderstand the real mission of Jehovah’s witnesses. Their privilege is to preach of the Kingdom for which the people have been praying for the past nineteen centuries, and now that kingdom is here. Instead of accepting that for which you have prayed, you defy the message and persecute the messengers of that kingdom. The Kingdom is the only salvation of the world.’ A few days ago he called me again to his office and apologized for his former threats and asked for all the literature. I told him he will have to advertise the Kingdom also if he expects life, and he says he is willing to do so. Many Catholics that previously have hoped to frighten me now have their eyes open and discern the deception of religion. After all this opposition, thanks to Jehovah! as I have distributed over 2,000 booklets during December.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A MODEL STUDY ON WHEELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A witness who drives a school bus suggested we gather the interested in the bus. After those near by were gathered we drove to another home several miles away, where the entire family are interested, and invited them to take their places in the bus, where ample seats, lights, and heat aided in carrying on a delightful model study. There were seventeen in attendance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRMNESS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We had our zone assembly, but had to move to Lockney, Texas, sixteen miles east in Floyd county, because the officials of Plainview refused to grant us the use of the courthouse, there being an American Legion meeting in the town on the same dates. I was not surprised, knowing there was to be a Legion assembly. The county judge refused on the grounds that he could not be responsible for what might happen, unless the Commissioners Court would take the responsibility. We at once tried to get space in the city auditorium and other buildings, but found the mayor had everything under his control. The mayor, John DuBose, is also a Legionnaire; therefore the town was closed to us. We drove over to Lockney. The postmaster and commander of the local American Legion post referred us to the city council and assisted us in other ways to secure the city auditorium. The city mayor and wife attended the public lecture and seemed to enjoy it very much. We were very thankful to Jehovah for this wonderful opportunity to serve, this being the largest and best assembly we have ever held in this zone. On the street the police chief approached me in this manner: ‘My name is Curry. I am the chief of police.’ Said I: ‘My name is Champagne. How are you, Chief!’ Said he: ‘You will have to get these people off the streets.’ (We had about one hundred on the street in the magazine work.) I asked: “Why! What have these sheep done !’ Said he: ‘They have done nothing, but you will have to get them off the street.’ This I refused to do, stating we must obey God rather than men, and this we will do, by His grace. Said he: We have a Legion meeting in town, and they are raising hell down at the auditorium.’ I said: Well, that is the place you should go and stop them. We are doing nothing wrong.’ Said he: ‘I have told you once.’ I replied: ‘I heard you the first time.’ Then he said: ‘I’d d----soon take them off.’ I replied: ‘Well, why don’t you</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">start right now!’ All had a good laugh, whereupon he turned and left. Like all cowards, I have not seen him since. The company secretary of Lubbock, Texas, was also picked up by the deputy sheriff, who took her to the sheriff’s office. Asked what she was doing, she replied: ‘Preaching the gospel as God has commanded.’ The sheriff remarked: ‘It’s a damn strange work you people are doing.’ She replied: ‘Oh, haven’t you read in the Bible that God is carrying on a “strange work”!’ The sheriff replied: ‘If it’s in the Bible it is sure being fulfilled.’ Then he told the deputy to take her back to the street, for she was doing a good work, and let her alone. She went back, rejoicing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A DAY’S WORK IN A VIRGINIA TOWN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Entering a furniture store I greeted three men with a cheery ‘Good morning!’ Unfolding a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and holding it so all could see its beauty I stated: ‘We are extending you an invitation to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.'</span><span class="font4"> Says one man: Why is it I can never hear Judge Rutherford on the air anymore!’ ‘Because the Lord has a better way. Listen to his recording “Instruction”.’ Results: Two subscriptions, two bound books, six booklets, six sound attendance. Using the same method all day, I counted up at the end and had four subscriptions, nine bound books, 21 booklets, 41 sound attendance, and nine copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> placed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death In order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>MAN’S TRUE GUFDE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.&quot;—Deut. 8:3.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVAH the Lord God made known to his typ-I ical covenant people, the Israelites, the words of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> the foregoing text. He caused Moses to make the announcement of that rule shortly before the Israelites were led into the land of Canaan. God had made a covenant with that people, and he was instructing them how they might receive the benefits of that covenant. They desired to live, and the Lord God was informing them what they must do in order to gain life everlasting. For the physical organism they would need their daily bread; but that was not all. In order to have life that is lasting, something of far greater power than material bread is needed. The Word of God furnishes that bread of life, and it is necessary for them to give heed to his Word in order to find the way to life. God’s rules are the same with regard to all intelligent creatures. There is but one way for any human creature to receive life everlasting. God does not change, neither do his rules change. Being the same at all times, they apply now to every one who seeks to be guided in the way to life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The angels are far superior to men. The angels can live forever only by being obedient to the Word of God. Concerning the angels it is written: “Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.”—Ps. 103: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Human creatures that voluntarily agree to do the will of God and whom God receives by and through Christ Jesus, and to whom he gives the promise that they shall be members of “the body of Christ” and reign with Christ Jesus, can attain to life everlasting in heaven only by giving heed to and obeying the Word of God. The rule, therefore, is the same concerning them as applies to the angels. All persons who enter into a covenant with Jehovah with the hope of life, either in heaven or on earth, are governed by the same rules. Concerning all such the Lord Jesus prayed to Jehovah in these words, which apply primarily to the spiritual class, but also to all of his covenant people, to wit: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”—John 17: 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> At the present day the Lord Jesus Christ, in obedience to his Father’s commandment, is gathering</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">unto himself his “other sheep”, who shall in due time form the “great multitude” (Rev. 7: 9-17) and whom the Lord will use to carry out his mandate to “fill the earth”. (Gen. 1: 28; 9:1) Such “other sheep” of the Lord are required to come under the same rule of God as applies to the spiritual class and to the angels in heaven, insofar as it pertains to their receiving life. They must live, as Jesus stated, “by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4); and, since Jesus quoted this from the law of God announced by Moses, this is further evidence that it applies at all times to all who are seeking the way to life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Demons have seduced and debauched human creatures since the time of Eden. Now in these last days the demons are seducing and debauching the entire human creation, and the only exceptions thereto are those persons who devote themselves to and faithfully obey the Lord God. Today many persons who desire to live are seeking the true guide to life; and for the aid of such </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> publishes what follows herein. If the people now on earth who are of good-will toward God would find the way to life everlasting they must be led by the true guide, which is God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The will of Almighty God expressed to his creatures is his Word and constitutes the true guide, which directs mankind into the way of life everlasting. Jehovah God sent Jesus to the earth to proclaim his expressed will, and this he did for the purpose of guiding men in the right way. The message which Jesus declared was and is not his own, but is that which proceeds from the mouth of Almighty God. Jesus said: “For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting; whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.”—John 12:49,50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> As further proof that this is the Word of God Jesus said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.” (John 7:16) That express will of God which Jesus uttered was and is the truth, and concerning such Jesus says: “Thy word is truth.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FALSE GODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ The “science of evolution” is offered as a guide for man, but that guide is absolutely false so far as furnishing to man a guide to life everlasting. It is based entirely on the theories and conclusions of men, and is therefore without any sure foundation. Says </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font6"> Volume 10, under the title “Evolution”, the following: “The history of evolution clearly reveals that the evolution idea is the result of a long evolution itself; it is impossible to say just when the idea came first into its more primitive form of being, or just when its principal modifications or accretions occurred, or when its present form was finally determined. In tracing the history of the unfolding of the evolution idea we shall find that the conspicuous achievements in connection with it have not been the discovery of absolute newness, but the recognition and determination and general establishment of the important ideas and conception germs among the host offered. . . . First, a stage of dim suggestion and pure speculation with little reference to facts; second, a stage of the statement of a working hypothesis to explain certain facts; and, third, the proof or demonstration of the law by facts. These stages can be recognized in the history of evolution. The first corresponds with the period of the Greek philosophers; the second with the postGreek, pre-Darwinian period; and the third with the Darwinian and post-Darwinian period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Applying the theory of evolution to man the evolutionists quote from Aristotle as follows: “Man is the highest point of one long and continuous ascent.” Thus it is seen that the theory of evolution is based wholly upon the opinions of men and the theory has been handed down from one generation to another by men wise in their own conceits. The evolution theory is flatly contradicted by the Word of Almighty God, which shows that evolution is a false guide.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Religion is offered as a guide to man. Religion is also a false guide. There are many kinds of religion, all claiming to be proper guides, but all are false. Religion, originated with the demons, of which Satan is the chief. Religion brought about the destruction of the old world by the flood of waters. Thereafter religion was organized on earth by human dictators acting under the influence and power of demons. Concerning religion the Almighty God specifically warned the Israelites that religion would ensnare them and bring about their destruction. (Deut. 7:16) Religion did bring about their destruction, exactly as God foretold and warned them: “And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them.”—Ps. 106: 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The Pharisees practiced and taught religion to the people, doctrines which had been handed down by tradition from one generation to another, even though those men claimed to be servants of God. They had yielded to the influence of demons and fallen into the Devil’s net. To them Jesus declared that their religious teachings were of the Devil and that by their traditional teachings they had made the Word of God of none effect amongst his covenant people. (Matt. 15:1-9) Thus Jesus showed that religion is a false guide for men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> The earthly religious organization today that exercises the greatest amount of influence and power over the people is that old organization of the Hierarchy operating from Vatican City. Those who compose that Hierarchy organization claim to have the Bible, but they do not teach the Bible to the people, but, on the contrary, attempt to keep the people from personal study of the Word of God. They claim that the pope is the sole interpreter of the Scriptures. The pope is a human creature, therefore a private one insofar as the Scriptures are concerned; and it is written in the Bible that no human authority can interpret the Scriptures. God alone is His interpreter. (2 Pet. 1: 20) The Hierarchy teaches the people the doctrines of “purgatory”, “torment,” “immortality of all souls,” and like doctrines, which find no support whatsoever in the Bible and are the mere opinions of men handed down from one generation to another. The venerable Cardinal Gibbons, recognized in his time as authority amongst those of the Hierarchy, in his book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers, page</span><span class="font6"> 208, states that these doctrines find their authority in the tradition of the early fathers of the Catholic organization. This is proof that the teachings of the doctrines above mentioned are traditional and are not founded in the Scriptures. That mighty religious organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, prevents the common people from studying the Bible, whereas the Lord’s Word says that all who would know the way to life must study to show themselves approved unto God, rightly dividing and applying his Word.—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> To the Jewish religionists, who were teaching tradition, Jesus said: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. I receive not honour from men. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.”—John 5:39-42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has the reputation extending over a long period of years of destroying the Bible that the people might be kept in ignorance of what God has to say to them. A striking example of very recent date follows: Spain is controlled by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Its dictator is a part of the Hierarchy. In 1940 the British and Foreign Bible Society, of London, sent a large consignment of Bibles to Spain for distribution amongst the people. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy dictator seized those Bibles and destroyed them. October 6,1940, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> published these facts in its first edition of that date, but after that first edition a powerful influence caused the same to be deleted from all other subsequent editions. A magazine in New York published the following comment concerning the same:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Bible in Spain. Protestants everywhere, and particularly those who are becoming more and more careful lest by any semblance of protesting they hurt the feelings of their Roman Catholic friends, would do well to ponder the fate of 110,000 copies of the Bible, including Testaments, which the British and Foreign Bible Society sent to Spain recently for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“By order of the Spanish Government, which is strongly Roman Catholic, the entire shipment was confiscated and pulped for the making of cellulose!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Spain, as everybody knows, has had an unenviable reputation for Bible destruction in years gone by, but this wholesale pulping of a hundred thousand copies is perhaps the most glaring example of open hostility to the Book that history records. And it occurred in 1940!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is exceedingly interesting to note, moreover, that this report, cabled from London, appeared in the early morning edition of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">of October 6, but was deleted from the second and following editions. Who ordered that it be cut out? What invisible censorship tried to prevent this highly significant item of news from reaching the people of this Protestant country?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Can anybody guess?”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Signs of the Times,</span><span class="font6"> January 21, 1941.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> The people must choose to follow tradition of men and walk on in the darkness concerning the way to life, or to gain knowledge from the Word of God, which points out the only way that leads to life everlasting. The purpose of Watchtower publications is to help the people to make a choice in harmony with God’s Word. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is not at all interested in holding up anybody to ridicule. It publishes the truth, and it is the truth of God’s Word that is sharper than a two-edged sword, and which exposes the fallacy of guides that are offered by men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Human theories concerning the way to life are directly in conflict with the Word of Almighty God. Those who desire to live should ignore human theories and give heed to the Word of God. The almighty Jehovah inspired holy men of old to act as his amanuenses and write down the truths given by him for man’s benefit; and concerning this it is written in the Scriptures: “For not at any time was prophecy brought by the will of man, but men from God spoke, being moved by holy spirit.” (2 Pet. 1: 21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott) </span><span class="font6">“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”—2 Tim. 3:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> The person who desires the approval of God must be guided aright. The Bible, which contains the Word of God, is true and is the correct guide: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) The Bible guides sincere persons to desire and to pray for the most important things that may result to their welfare. God has put such prayers into the mouth of his sincere servants, and one of these prayers is this: “Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.”—Ps. 25:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The sure and unfailing promises of God to such sincere seekers for truth are certain, and God will fulfill those promises; as it is written: “Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.” (Ps. 25:8-10) “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.” (Ps. 33:4) “For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.” (Ps. 100:5) “For thy mercy is great above the heavens; and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.” (Ps. 108:4) “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.”— Ps. 119:142.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> He who would be wise in things that are right seeks pure knowledge, such as is contained in the Bible: “Wise men lay up knowledge; but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.” (Prov. 10:14) ‘Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge; but he that hateth reproof is brutish.” (Prov. 12:1) “The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.”—Prov. 18:15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The person who is wise and pursues a wise and prudent course desires to live forever and enjoy all the blessings that God has provided for those who love him. There is but one way to life, and that way is to receive a knowledge of God and Christ Jesus and then obey the commandments of the Lord and continue to follow in the right way: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) The person that would please God and live must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that Christ Jesus is his great Executive Officer, and he must fear to displease God. Such a person begins to acquire the right kind of knowledge. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; but fools despise wisdom and instruction.”—Prov. 1: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> One is foolish to rely upon his own understanding and to ignore the Word of God: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil.” (Proy. 3:5-7) To follow the traditions of men, which are contrary to the Word of God, is to pursue a course of evil.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUTHENTICITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Worldly-wise men deny the authority of God’s Word. They deny the existence of God. What is the proof that the Bible contains the authentic record of God’s Word? The evidence, which furnishes the conclusive proof, is both circumstantial and direct, and the two kinds of evidence fully corroborate each other. Here the evidence circumstantial and that which is direct will be considered together, and will be found to fully establish the authenticity of the Bible as God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> “The Bible” is the name given to what is written in the sixty-six books bound together and forming one book. It has in reality only one Author, who is God, and its one great purpose is to furnish a guide to man who desires to walk in the way of righteousness and live and to honor his Maker. The “canon” of the Scriptures is the collection or catalogue of the books or writings into one volume. The Book contains sacred writings God has provided, and which Book is called “The Holy Bible”. Such contains the true rule and guide for faithful men. Other writings for which claim has been made as to their genuineness, but which are spurious, are called “the Apocrypha”. The word “canon”, from the classic Greek, means “a straight rod or rule”. It is a measuring rod. As to the Bible, it means the rule of truth. Concerning this sacred rule the inspired apostle wrote: “And as many as walk according to this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rule,</span><span class="font6"> peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.” (Gal. 6:16; see also 2 Cor. 10:13-16) Without any doubt the spirit of Almighty God directed faithful men to arrange the canon of the Scriptures according to his will. That much could not be said of any other book in existence. All the evidence, when considered together, proves beyond all doubt that the Author of the Holy Scriptures set out in the Bible is Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, and which name means his purpose toward his creatures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> Moses, as a servant and an amanuensis of God, ■wrote the five books that appear first in order in the Bible. Moses was selected by Jehovah God as his servant to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. At Mount Sinai God took Moses up into the mountain and there dictated to him the fundamental law, which law was written on stone, and which has been translated and recorded in the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> The Scriptures disclose that God invites man to reason with him (Isa. 1:18); and the fact that the Creator endowed man with faculties of reason shows that it is proper that man reach a conclusion by process of reasoning in harmony with facts and authority which cannot be disputed. Moses was a learned man, “learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” (Acts 7: 22) Moses records the fact that God spoke to him and directed him to go into Egypt, saying, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” (Ex. 3:14) “I AM” means the Everlasting One, not the One who was, nor the One who will be, but the One who is. The great I AM made known to Moses his name Jehovah, and this was the first time his name was thus revealed. (Ex. 6:2,3) The general history of the human kind could well have been known to Moses even before God revealed his great truth to Moses and before Moses was selected to go to Egypt, because of the following circumstances, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Adam was the original man, from whom the race sprang. Adam lived 930 years, and lived 300 years of that time after the birth of Enoch, a man whom God approved. Enoch was the father of Methuselah, who lived 969 years. Noah was the third generation from Enoch. He was a grandson of Methuselah and must have received much information from his grandfather. Noah was 600 years old when the flood came. Being devoted to Almighty God, he would certainly gather all the information he could from his forefathers, and hence would have a very accurate account of the race from Adam to Noah’s day. That information he would transmit to his sons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> Noah and his sons came out of the ark together, and Noah lived 350 years thereafter. His son Shem lived 502 years after the flood. (Gen. 9:28,29; 11:10,11) Two years after Noah’s death Abraham was born, and therefore Shem and Abraham were on the earth together for a period of 150 years. It is reasonable that Abraham would learn from Shem the facts concerning the human race which Shem had received from his forefathers. Abraham bore the title of ‘father of the faithful’; and since knowledge is necessary to faith, Abraham must have had as the basis of faith the necessary knowledge from the creation of man until his day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Isaac was the beloved son of Abraham and would no doubt receive faithful instruction from his faithful father. The favorite son of Isaac was Jacob. (Gen. 28:5-14) Jacob had twelve sons, and he bestowed his greatest affection upon Joseph, evidently by the Lord’s direction. Joseph was a man of great importance in Egypt and would be widely known by almost all of the people of Egypt, and particularly by the Israelites who resided there. Less than fifty years after the death of Joseph Moses was born. When Moses became a man he devoted himself entirely to the Almighty God. It is only reasonable that Moses was thoroughly familiar with the history of his forefathers from the time of Adam to his own time, when God called him to be the deliverer of the Israelites. From the human viewpoint, as shown by the facts and circumstances, Moses was amply qualified to write the history of mankind from the beginning until his own day. Intelligent men have a natural tendency to keep a record of facts and events, and it is but reasonable that Moses had a fund of true information duly set down to be passed on to other generations. So much from the human viewpoint.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> None of the testimony mentioned here will be accepted by evolutionists or higher critics who have no faith in God. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14:1) A person does not need to say in words, “There is no God”; but by his own conduct or course of action he discloses his secret thoughts. All visible creation testifies to the indisputable fact that there is a Supreme One who is the Creator, the Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The miraculous birth of Jesus, his teachings, his crucifixion and his resurrection out of death are supported by a multitude of witnesses, all of which establish the fact that Jesus was not an ordinary man, but the Son of Almighty God. A host of heavenly angels bore testimony at the time of the birth of the babe Jesus that he is “Christ the Lord”.—Luke 2: 9-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The circumstantial evidence of the miraculous birth of Jesus, and the direct testimony delivered by the man Christ Jesus during the three and more years of his ministry, establishes the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures, or Bible, as the Word of Almighty God. After his resurrection by the power of Almighty God, Christ Jesus appeared to his faithful disciples, at which time he confirmed the words which he had spoken to them before his death. At the same time he testified as to the authenticity of what is written in the law and in the prophecies and in the songs which we call “Psalms”. It was then he said: “These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.”—Luke 24:44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> After his ascension into heaven the Lord gave to John, his faithful servant, a revelation of the things that must come to pass: “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.”—Rev. 1:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’’Jesus Christ is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev. 1:5; 3:14) The testimony of Christ Jesus, therefore, imports absolute verity. Jehovah, the Almighty God, sent his beloved Jesus to the earth to tell the truth, and he told the truth. When standing before the Roman governor, charged with treason, Jesus testified, to wit: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.”—John 18: 37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> The testimony of Jesus when he was a man on earth is further proof that the Pentateuch, or the first five books of the Bible, were written by Moses at the dictation of Almighty God. (Mal. 4:4; Matt. 8:4; Mark 1:44; 7:10; 12:26; Luke 5:14; John 3:14; 7:19,22,23) After his resurrection out of death, and when Jesus appeared unto his faithful disciples, his testimony to them fully confirmed what he had told them when he was with his disciples: “And beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.”—Luke 24: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>85</sup> Not only was Moses the servant of Jehovah and used by Jehovah to write the five books first appearing in the Bible, but he was a prophet of Almighty God and foreshadowed Christ Jesus, the great Prophet. The testimony of Jesus confirms this statement, when we note that he said: “Moses . . . wrote of me.” The religious leaders amongst the Jews were opposed to Jesus and, addressing them, he said: “Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.”—John 5: 45, 46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> Not only did he say that Moses had written a portion of the Bible and had written of Christ Jesus, but furthermore he testified: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me.”—John 5:39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>87</sup> Moses was a type of Christ Jesus, the great Prophet; which the evidence completely establishes. Addressing his words to the Israelites, the covenant people of God, Moses uttered this prophecy: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deut. 18:15) That prophecy is fulfilled in Christ Jesus: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3: 22, 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” Christ Jesus is that great Prophet, who speaks with full authority conferred upon him by his Father, the Almighty God Jehovah. Repeatedly the testimony given by Jesus shows that his Father, the Almighty God, sent Jesus to the earth and that the testimony of Jesus is in exact accord with the will of his Father. (John 6: 38, 39) To his learned critics Jesus said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.&quot; (John 7:16) Jesus always testified to the truth as he was directed by Jehovah.—John 8:28,29,42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The holy spirit, which is the invisible power of Almighty God, moved upon faithful men of old to write what is set forth in the prophecies and which is there written according to the will of Almighty God. This is a guarantee that the prophecies are true. The testimony of Jesus confirms the authenticity of the prophecies. Both the acts and the words of Jesus refer specifically to the prophets; which proves that the prophecies written in times of old, as set out in the Bible, are true. Note some of the things which Jesus did in confirming the words of the prophets recorded in ancient times.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> Early in his earthly ministry he read from the prophecy of Isaiah, to wit: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the‘acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isa. 61:1,2) “And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” (Luke 4:18,19, 21) Thus he proved the authenticity of Isaiah’s prophecy. Jesus, in fulfillment of a certain portion of Isaiah’s prophecy, healed the sick: “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.” (Matt. 8:17) Thus he directly applies this prophecy to himself. He repeated the words of the prophet Malachi and applied the same to himself: “For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.” (Mal. 3:1; Matt. 11:10) He repeated the prophecy written at Isaiah 42:1-3 and applied the same to himself. (Matt. 12:17-20) From the prophecy of Jonah Jesus quoted, fully testifying to the authenticity of that prophecy. (Matt. 12:39-41) He referred to the prophecy concerning Solomon and the queen of the south and then said: “Behold, a greater than Solomon is here.” (Matt. 12:42) Jesus spoke in parables, “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,” at Psalm 78: 2: “I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old.”—Matt. 13: 31-35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> At Matthew 21:4, 5 Jesus quoted with approval other prophecies: Zechariah 9:9 and Isaiah 62:11. Jesus cited with approval the prophecy of Daniel 9:27 and Daniel 11:31. (See Matthew 24:15.) At the same time he spoke of the conditions in the earth that prevailed in the day of Noah and told his hearers that a similar state of affairs would again obtain upon earth in the last days, thus proving the authenticity of the prophecy of Noah and prophesying of “the time of the end”. (Matt. 24:37-39; see also Matt. 27:9-35) Jesus testified as to the authenticity of the law and of all the holy prophets (Matt. 11:13), and stated that upon these the two great commandments of God are based. (Matt. 22: 36-40) Having testified to the authenticity of the law and of the prophets, which are set forth in the Holy Scriptures, and having stated that he received these truths from the Almighty God, his Father, Jesus summed up the matter in these authoritative words: “Thy word is truth.” —John 17:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> For more than three years the twelve apostles of Jesus were personally taught by him. God gave him those apostles, and all except one of them remained faithful. (John 17:6-10) The testimony is abundant that at Pentecost the faithful apostles received the outpouring of the holy spirit of God in fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by Joel. (Joel 2:28; Acts 2:1-21) Inspired and moved by the holy spirit of God, Peter the apostle then and there testified that the Lord God had raised Jesus out of death, and then added: “God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ”; and at the same time cited the prophecy foretelling that great and marvelous act of God. (Acts 2:31-36) Later the apostle Peter wrote concerning the prophets: “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.”—2 Pet. 1:20,21; see also 2 Sam. 23:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> Paul the apostle, who was made a special ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ and who was anointed and filled with the holy spirit, under inspiration of the holy spirit testified concerning the authenticity of the Scriptures in these words: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”—2 Tim. 3:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHECY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> The prophecies recorded in the Holy Scriptures are the most conclusive circumstantial evidence of the authenticity of the scriptures set forth in the Bible. A human could not foretell with accuracy events coming to pass in the long-distant future. All true prophecy proceeds from the Almighty God, Jehovah. He is perfect in wisdom and knows the end from the beginning: “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) It was the great Jehovah, the Eternal One, who caused these prophecies to be written according to his will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> The true prophet of God is one who speaks as he is directed by the power of Jehovah to speak. He does not utter man’s message, but utters God’s message. Christ Jesus is the great Prophet of Jehovah, who speaks with authority from his Father. True prophecy is recorded authoritative words declaring things that must come to pass in future days. It appears that at the time of uttering the prophecies the men who uttered or recorded them did not understand the meaning thereof. But in his own due time God makes known to righteous men the meaning of such prophecies. This is proved by the words of Jesus addressed to his disciples. He had told them what the future years would bring forth, particularly with reference to the end of the world. He instructed them concerning the holy spirit, which God would send after Jesus ascended into heaven, and which he did send upon his faithful servants at Pentecost. During his last days on earth with his disciples Jesus said to them: “And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.”—John 14: 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>46</sup> That which stands out most prominently in the Bible is its teaching concerning the kingdom of God, and because of its paramount importance Jesus instructed his followers that they should always pray for the coming of that kingdom. (Matt. 6:9,10) It is God’s kingdom, and necessarily all prophecy concerning that kingdom must proceed from the Almighty God. Christ Jesus is the duly appointed and anointed King of the kingdom of God. All the prophets of God foretell the coming of that kingdom and the King, and point forward to that day as one of greatest importance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> When man was in Eden Jehovah God uttered the first prophecy. (Gen. 3:14-17) Thereafter he used men who had wholly devoted themselves to God’s service to utter prophecy and write it down at his dictation. Under inspiration of the holy spirit God caused Peter to utter the words of prophecy concerning the great King, Christ Jesus, and then to say: “Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.”—Acts 3:24; 3:20-26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Over a period of practically four thousand years men of old who were devoted to God and who prophesied according to God’s will foretold the coming of Christ Jesus the Messiah. Not only did they foretell his coming, but they recorded the minute details of the place where he would be born, his ministry, his temptation, his persecution, his suffering, his ignominious death, and his resurrection and exaltation. Such wisdom could proceed only from the Almighty God. The fact that those prophecies were fulfilled exactly as foretold proves the authenticity of the same beyond any question of doubt. (For further discussion of the prophecies see the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>49</sup> Prophecy of God cannot be understood by men who have no faith in God and in Christ. Such men are blind to the truth. A man who has no faith in God and does not believe God’s Word cannot understand the Bible. Such men rely upon their own learning and walk on in the dark. Such men class themselves as “higher critics” and as evolutionists and base their arguments upon the “science” of evolution. Concerning them God says: ‘They are fools.’ (Ps. 14:1) In these latter days the colleges teach evolution concerning man, his creation, and his development, and ignore entirely the Word of God. They are wise in their own conceits, and concerning such the Lord in his Word says: “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.” (Job 5:13,14) “The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?”—Jer. 8: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>50</sup> Men are imperfect, and their theories are like^ wise imperfect. Men and their theories die, but the Word of God endures for ever: “The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.”—Isa. 40: 7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> Peter walked with the Lord and learned of him, and, inspired by the spirit of God, he wrote: “For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord en-dureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” (1 Pet. 1: 24, 25) Another inspired apostle testifies: “And the world pass-eth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”—1 John 2:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNTO LIFE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> The person who desires to live seeks knowledge at the Word of God. He seeks to learn and to do that which is right. The following scripture text expresses the sincere desire of such person: “I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Order my steps in thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.”—Ps. 119:101,105,133.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“ The person who ignores the Word of God cannot receive life everlasting. ‘Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.” (Prov. 13:13,14) If that person desires to avoid that which defiles and leads to destruction he is diligent to seek information from God’s Word. “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way! By taking heed thereto according to thy word. With my whole heart have I sought thee; 0 let me not wander from thy commandments. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.” “Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them. The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.”—Ps. 119:9-11,129,130.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPLETE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The Word of God is complete and needs nothing to be added to or taken away therefrom. God is the fountain of life, and his Word points out the way to life: “Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.” (Deut. 4:2) “Every word of God is pure; he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.” (Prov. 30: 5, 6) “For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.”—Rev. 22:18,19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>55</sup> The Pharisees, and the modern-day religionists also, take from the Scriptures what God has said and in the place thereof substitute their own words and the traditions of other men. Thus they make the Word of God of none effect, detrimental to the interest of the people who give heed to them, and hence all are headed for destruction.—Mark 7: 5-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>S6</sup> The wise person is one who follows the guide which God has provided for him. That person may be unlearned in things of this world, but if he seeks righteousness and meekness at the mouth of God he becomes wiser than the learned religionists who attempt to teach the people their theories: “Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies [than my religious teachers]: for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients; because I keep thy precepts.”—Ps. 119: 98-100.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>SI</sup> “For what if some did not believe! shall their [evolutionists, higher critics and religionists’] unbelief make the faith of God without effect! God forbid: yea,let God be true, but every man a liar.”-Rom. 3:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>68</sup> Jehovah gives full assurance to men that his Word shall not return unto him void, but shall be fully and completely performed and fulfilled. Such assurance is given that those who put their trust in him may have a sure anchorage for their hope: “For as the rain cometh down, and the snow, from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” (Isa. 55:10,11) “Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us; which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and sted-fast, and which entereth into that within the vail.” (Heb. 6:17-19) “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.”—Matt. 24: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITUAL FOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>50</sup> Those in a covenant with God to do his will must have food for the mind. God has furnished such food in abundance, and every word uttered by the Lord is truth and food for the mind: “Princes [worldly rulers] have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.” (Ps. 119:161, 162) “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart; for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.”—Jer. 15:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> The “mountain of the Lord” symbolically pictures his kingdom, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and which capital organization is called “Zion”. “Jerusalem” stands for all of Jehovah’s organization: “But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”—Mic. 4:1, 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>61</sup> Because religionists and evolutionists teach the people the doctrines of men and multitudes give heed to such teachings and disregard God’s Word, there is a famine now in the land amongst such for the hearing of the truth: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.”—Amos 8:11.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>62</sup> Therefore Jehovah God has risen up and sends forth his witnesses to carry his message of truth from house to house to all those who hunger for the truth, that they may have opportunity to hear and to find the way to life. The prophecy of Amos 8:11 is now being fulfilled, and at the same time the prophecy of Isaiah 28: 21 is being fulfilled. Jehovah is doing his “strange work”, and he gives his humble and faithful people a part in that work. This work of testifying to the name and to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah must be completed, and then quickly will follow his “strange act”, which means the destruction of Satan’s organization. The people must choose between the leadership of men, such as religionists and evolutionists, and the perfect guide, Jehovah, and his Word. Here the words of Joshua, who was a type of Christ Jesus, are appropriate: “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Josh. 24:15) Choose and follow the true Guide, and live!</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>&quot;RICH MEN, WEEP AND HOWL”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">•• O TO now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your i “Tmiseries that shall come upon you.” To whom are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* these words of the apostle James, at chapter five, verse one, addressed? Manifestly to those who are opposed to the kingdom of righteousness, the ideal government, The Theocracy of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. For long students of the Bible have considered the “rich men” as applying to the banking interests of the world, notably Jewish bankers, but there seems to be another application, and that from the ecclesiastical viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While there are some men of great material wealth identified with the religionist systems of “Christendom”, and while it is true that some of these men have been instrumental in the operations and schemes working to the material detriment of their fellow men, it is still more true that there have been spiritual riches entrusted to the custody of a class of mighty ones in the spiritual field who have used such to the great detriment and oppression of the followers of Christ Jesus. It is not probable that the materially wealthy are the men exclusively referred to as “rich men”. The above quoted words of the apostle James apply specifically to the clergy, the leaders and mighty men of the so-called “church”, both Catholic and Protestant. In support thereof the following is cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Addressing his disciples, and manifestly intending the near-by religious Pharisees to hear his speech, Jesus said: “No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” And the record adds: “And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things; and they derided him.” (Luke 16: 13,14) Those words of Jesus galled the religious Pharisees, because they understood that they were guilty of the very things about which Jesus spoke. They had been and were unfaithful to Jehovah God and their covenant with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Pharisees then occupied a position of great ease and comfort as compared to what the common people had. Their place corresponded with the position of the clergymen of the big religious organizations of the present time, which affords them ease, creature comforts, and much power among the people. As the Pharisees, compared with the common people, were thus rich, likewise the clergymen of the big religious organizations of the present time are rich. They were “covetous” or “lovers of money”. (Rotherham’s translation) In them was the “root of all evil”. (1 Tim. 6:10) Such was the condition of the Pharisees, and in this they pictured a class that occupy a similar position in these “the last days” and that are described by the Scriptures as being covetous and entirely unfaithful. (2 Tim. 3- 1, 2) The Pharisees, hearing the words of Jesus, attempted to justify their position, and this they manifestly did that they might hold the support of the common people and continue to enjoy without interruption their condition of ease and comfort. Jesus, knowing their minds and hearing what they had to say, answered their words of derision and said to them: “Ye are they which justify yourselves before men , but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God ” —Luke 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their self-exaltation among men made them an abomination in the sight of God. Those religionists feared that men would not think so highly of them as they desired, and, having a desire for the approval of men and fearing to lose the same, they had been led into the snare of the Devil. (Prov. 29:25) They had become religionists and were therefore an abomination in the sight of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus’ words thus identify the Pharisees and the modernday class that they picture as being the “rich man” in the prophetic parable which Jesus forthwith delivered to his disciples and in the presence of the Pharisees, to wit: “There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass, that . . . the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments.”—Luke 16:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This parable had its small-scale or miniature fulfillment and application to the religionists of the Jewish people. The Jews, as a people, were in a covenant with God. They were favored above all other peoples of the earth, because God had said of them: “You only have I known of all the families of the earth.” (Amos 3:2) The chief men among the Jews were the clergy, particularly the Pharisees, who were bound by the covenant to teach the people the commandments of God and themselves to obey those commandments. The Pharisees having set before them the privileges and blessings of the promised kingdom were in line to be truly rich, conditioned upon their faithful obedience to God. As stated at Proverbs 10:22: “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich.” Instead of obeying God’s commandments and in due time receiving the proper riches, they preferred to receive the favor and the power and the plaudits that might come to them by ruling over and dominating the people and receiving what the world might bestow upon them. They were “high-minded” and “trusted in uncertain riches”. (1 Tim. 6: 9,10,17) Among the favored Jews was Judas Iscariot. Jesus had chosen him as one of his disciples and had assigned Judas to a responsible place in His company. Judas was in line for great heavenly riches, but he preferred to have things visible that might enrich him among men, and, falling into the snare of the Devil, Judas betrayed his Master Christ Jesus, and Judas was therefore named by Him as “the son of perdition”. —John 17:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That which came to pass upon the Jews, particularly the religious element of that people, constituted types or prophetic patterns of larger things to come to pass in our day, and those things concerning the Jews were “written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come”. (1 Cor. 10: 6,11) Those now opposed to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and yet falsely claiming to have God for their Father do collectively make up “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” (2 Thess. 2:1-3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font4">The “man of sin” and “son of perdition” of today is a composite body made up of men who are in an implied covenant to do God’s will or in an actual covenant to do so. Such “man of sin”, “son of perdition,” includes clergymen, the “elective elders” of congregations, and particularly those classed by the Lord Jesus as the “evil servant”; all of whom conspire together to do injury to God’s Theocratic organization and persecute his people. (See Matthew 24:24,48-50; 2 Thess. 2:9.) All of that composite body are the instrument of the Devil and opposed to God’s kingdom. All such are religionists and practice in some form what is improperly labeled “the Christian religion”. The clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead among such religionists and are given to bombastic claims, while others likewise boast and lay claim to that which they do not have, and all such render evil to Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, and all are pictured by Judas and are all in one and the same class, their end being the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus describes the “rich man”, but does not give his name. Probably that was due to the fact that the class pictured is made up of God’s enemies who are not worthy of a name. The rich man’s description fits the class above mentioned. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy of control are rich in this world’s goods literally, and they, together with others who practice religion for temporary gain, enjoy many material riches of this world, and the plaudits and honor of men, and they have become high-minded and heady. They are, as 2 Timothy 3:1-5 describes them, the class arising in these evil days, being ‘lovers of their own selves, boasters, proud, blasphemers, covenant-breakers, de-spisers of that which is good’, and they persecute those who proclaim the Kingdom message. While claiming to serve God, they exhibit a godlike attitude but deny the power of godliness. They draw near to God with their mouth only, but take a course of action contrary to God’s commands. They follow the traditions of men, which they teach and by which they make the Word of God of none effect. (Isa. 29:9-13; Matt. 15:7-9) They are hypocrites and an abomination in God’s sight. The deceitfulness of worldly riches (that is, what this world can give) chokes them off from the truth of God’s Word. (Luke 8:14; Rom. 3:1, 2) They are greedy and covetous, and love ease and the approval of men, and therefore are blinded to God’s purpose.—Isa. 56:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such ones class themselves as being rich, like the Laodi-ceans, who say: “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.” (Rev. 3:17) Concerning such religionists, particularly the leaders that go to make up the great organization symbolized as “Babylon”, it is written: “How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her.”—Rev. 18:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus described the “rich man” as wearing purple. The modern-day “rich man” is wealthy enough to buy royal robes. The rich man in the parable is described as wearing fine linen, which, when applied to God’s faithful ones, is a symbol of the righteousness of saints. (Rev. 19:8,14) The modern-day “rich man” is self-righteous, but does not possess any of the righteousness of the saints. The “rich man” class ignore the true riches of God: “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” (Rom. 10:3) They have looked to self and to self-interest, and continue to exalt themselves and push aside the “other sheep” of the Lord, as pictured by the beggar named Lazarus. They do nothing to bring comfort to those who are poor and seeking the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further addressing them the apostle James says: “Your [claimed] riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.” (5:2) That there are two kinds of treasure Jesus showed when he said: “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth [tangible things, such as material wealth, or intangible things, such as the emoluments, honors, preferments of men, reputation, etc.] where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven [treasures given by God, who is in heaven] where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.”—Matt. 6:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opportunity was given to lay up the incorruptible heavenly treasure, but the ecclesiastical systems, particularly the clergy class, have preferred the earthly treasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They have spurned the invitation to walk humbly and faithfully in Jesus’ footsteps and, like him, be witnesses for Jehovah, but have doted on great buildings, costly furnishings, paid choirs, gorgeous robes, numerous followers whom they count by the millions, great drives for money and members, plaudits of men, political preferment, titles, sumptuous meals, ease and comfort. As described at Jeremiah 5: 26-31, they, to accomplish their purpose in laying up the earthly riches, have preached falsely and have made themselves rulers by the same fraudulent means; they have grown fat, and they shine, and verily they have their reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus warned against the riches which “moth and rust doth corrupt”. To the “rich men” the apostle James says: “Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.” The word rendered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">corrupt</span><span class="font4"> means “putrefy, perish” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Strong’s Con.)-</span><span class="font4"> and truly such riches are putrefied and are perishing. A moth-eaten garment is one full of holes, disclosing nakedness. The official “robe of righteousness”, symbolic of God’s approval, now covers the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses. (Isa. 61:10) The religious clergy, assuming to wear that beautiful robe, have neglected the Kingdom requirements, and now the covering of their own righteousness is moth-eaten and their nakedness is exposed, nevertheless they boast of their riches. To such the Lord Jesus says: “Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know-est not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor [spiritually], and blind, and naked.”—Rev. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore James 5: 3 adds: “Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you.” Canker is a corroding rust that is destructive. Now, the rusting of literal gold and silver would be no cause of God’s pronouncing a severe judgment against men. These words “gold and silver” apply spiritually to the divine truths committed into the custody of the church, truths which the clergy by neglect and willful misrepresentation have permitted to become .obscured as by corroding rust. “The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.” (Ps. 12:6) “The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold ” (Ps. 19: 9,10) The divine truths so brightly, beautifully and wonderfully set forth in the Word of God, the clergy have permitted to become covered with the canker and rust of traditions of men, higher criticism, evolution and humanitarianism, until by reason thereof the divine truths are hidden from many honest minds who would have heeded the truth had they been taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle James adds that in the day of retribution “the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire”. Silent, but potent, is the witness of the rust at this very hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then declares the Lord’s servant (James 5:3,4) : “Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth [of armies].” To apply these words exclusively to the owners of literal fields of grain seems hardly permissible. Many are the farmers who own their own fields, and nowadays they pay liberal wages to those who aid in the reaping time. The courts of the land are always open to compel any defrauder to pay, and in most jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, nothing is exempt from execution to pay the wages duly earned by labor. But when the words of James are considered from the ecclesiastical viewpoint, the entire question is clarified. The great Master said: “The field is the world.” (Matt. 13:38) Who have claimed to be owners of the field? The clergy, the “rich men” themselves, by their conduct answer: 'We are possessed of all spiritual wisdom, and to us has been committed the responsibility of looking out for the spiritual welfare of the world. No one else is ordained to preach or teach. We are the watchman of the flock, and we alone are entitled to the fleece. What the world needs is </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">more religion !’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But did these engage in the ‘reaping’ ? No! Those who have followed the example of the Lord Jesus and his apostles and have gone “from house to house” and called upon the people at their homes and offered to them the message of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus have been the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses and their faithful companions of good-will.—Matt. 10:12-14; Acts 20: 20; 2:46</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Were these “labourers” in the field entitled to any hire or wage from the rulers in the religious systems? Yes, they were; for the reason that these mighty men openly pretended to be the representatives of the Lord Jesus and to be owners of the field. Does not Romans 13:8 read: “Owe no man any thing, but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law” ? Jesus specifically commanded his followers to love one another even as he loved us. That would mean that each one who claims to be a Christian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">owes</span><span class="font4"> it to his brother to love, encourage, comfort and help him. The faithful laborers in the field expected to receive buffetings from the world; but they were justly entitled to receive from all who professed faith in Christ the wage of encouragement, comfort and love. Had the clergy paid their hire or wage, many of the congregations would have paid the laborers a like wage. But, says the apostle: ‘You have by resort to fraudulent means kept back the just wage of the reaper.’ And how did they do this ? By fraudulently representing to the peoples of “Christendom” that Jehovah’s witnesses were not ordained to preach and that they were ignorant, dishonest and vicious persons, yea, even enemies to the peoples, and should be shunned and persecuted. Notwithstanding this, the loyal followers of the Master pushed on with their work in the field. Often tired, weary and footsore, despised of men and mobbed and persecuted, they toiled on, almost fainting. Many times when a word of loving-kindness and encouragement would have helped, it was not forthcoming. The bitter tears of sorrow often burned their cheeks; and they cried aloud, and, says the apostle, ‘the cries of them are entered into the ears of the Lord of heavenly armies,’ who bides his own time for the day of reckoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Turning again to the same class of “rich men”, James 5: 5 says: “Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.” This means they have practiced self-indulgence to the reckless and utter disregard of other Christians, continuing it even to the day of God’s vengeance. In terse language Isaiah 56:10 describes them, saying: “His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This company, which the Lord calls hypocrites, the apostle (James 5:6) charges with a grave crime, saying: “Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.” Prior to the writing of this epistle by James the clergy of the Jews had caused the Lord Jesus to be hanged on the tree on Calvary. Moved by the same wicked designs, the wicked Edomite King Herod, the ancient prototype of the modern religious element among whom the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is chief, imprisoned and killed John the Baptist, a righteous man. John prophetically pictured a class of faithful Christians who at the end of the world, where we now are, were, because of obedience and loyalty to the Lord God, temporarily restrained of liberty and rendered useless during and for some time after the World War period. “Killed” means rendered inactive, helpless, or useless. By the sword of war they “killed” the witness work in 1918, and also some of the witnesses, as symbolically pictured at Revelation 11:7-10. But yet more recently than that, to wit, during the year 1940 and since, has occurred the worst persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, Christians, in the nation’s history, and at the instance of the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what may we expect to follow shortly? James 5:1 answers: ‘Come now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries which will soon be upon you.’ (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth’s trans.) </span><span class="font4">To paraphrase: ‘Judgment has begun at the house of God, and now it shall shortly come to you. You have lived selfishly, in utter disregard of the rights and welfare of the church of Christ. You have heaped up earthly riches, but these are now worthless. Your titles are empty and meaningless. The divine truths you have permitted to be covered and hid by a corroding rust Your nakedness is apparent before God and man. You have defrauded the humble and faithful laborers in the Lord’s witness work. You could not feed God’s people, and you have conspired to prevent others from doing so. All these things are witness against you, condemning you, and they shall eat your flesh as it were fire.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the 17th and 18th chapters of The Revelation the “Lord of Sabaoth [armies]” vividly describes the fall of these evil religious systems, to wit, antitypical Babylon, and the howling and weeping of the “rich men” thereof. Shortly the people, enlightened as to the facts and motives of the wicked religious system, will unite to complete her destruction : “And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will.” (Rev. 17:16,17) Then the “rich men” shall “weep and mourn”, because the hour of retribution is at hand. (Rev. 18:11) Jehovah declares his determination to “rise up to the prey” and pour out his indignation. (Z'eph. 3:8) The Lord Jesus declares that this expressed indignation of Jehovah at the battle of Armageddon will be such as man has never before known, but it will be the last. (Matt. 24: 21, 22) “Be patient therefore, brethren.”—Jas. 5: 7.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>WHO BEARS UP THE GOVERNMENT?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE CHILD had not been born when the prophet Isaiah wrote: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isa. 9: 6, 7) The words he wrote applied to a future time; hence these words constituted a prophecy. Isaiah could not understand the full meaning or import of his own words, nor could any man prior to the giving of God’s holy spirit on the day of Pentecost following Jesus’ resurrection. Isaiah did not know about that. Why, then, did he say, “Unto us a child is born” ? Whom did he mean by “us”? Primarily he meant the natural house of Israel, which house then constituted God’s chosen people, whom God had selected and set aside for his own purposes. However, “Israel after the flesh” foreshadowed spiritual Israel, “the Israel of God,” and Isaiah’s prophecy had reference more to the latter. Although spoken as in the present tense as though pertaining to the time when Isaiah was serving in the office of prophet, his words concerning the “child” refer to some future time. The time must come when this prophecy should be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the exercise of his loving-kindness Jehovah God made provision for the redemption of humankind by payment of a ransom. “Ransom” means “an exact corresponding price”; that is to say, an eye for an eye,- a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life. Such is the statement of the divine law, at Exodus 21: 23, 24 and Deuteronomy 19: 21. An angel could not become man’s redeemer, because angels are greater than men and of a different form of life. “For thou hast made him [man] a little lower than the angels.”—Ps. 8: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The term “incarnate” means to be invested with a body of flesh, to be clothed with flesh. An incarnated creature would therefore be a spirit creature who is merely for the time being clothed with a human form, but is at the same time in truth and in fact a spirit, and not a man. The incarnation theory is that Jesus, when he was on this earth, was a divine person who walked around in human body; and that it was only this human body that died. It is easy to be seen that an incarnated creature could not provide the ransom price. The one who furnishes a “life for a life” in behalf of the right to life that Adam forfeited for his offspring must be one that not only appears as a human creature perfect in organism, but that must really be a human creature and have the right to life as a human creature He must exactly correspond with Adam before Adam sinned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one that would provide the ransom price for such of Adam’s offspring as would believe and obey must therefore be just exactly equal to the perfect Adam. For this reason, as recorded at Psalm 49:7, upon earth there was none that could, meet these requirements nor give to God a ransom for man. But in due time God sent forth his Son, “made of a woman,” which means that he was “made flesh” and dwelt among men. (Gal. 4:4; John 1:14) Of course, Jehovah God and his only-begotten Son, The Logos, or Word, were at all times higher than the angels; God is without beginning, and the Logos was the “beginning of the creation of God” and the active agent of Jehovah God in the creation of all things that were created.—John 1:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Hebrews 2:9 it is written: “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” Of necessity the one providing the redemption for mankind must be a man, not more nor less; otherwise he could not be an exact corresponding price That Jesus </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">was</span><span class="font4"> a man is further testified to by the apostle, at 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6: “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">man </span><span class="font4">Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To provide the ransom price such man must be without sin. But how could he be without sin if brought forth from an imperfect woman? The answer is that Jesus was not begotten of imperfect man, but begotten in the womb of Mary by the power'of Jehovah. (Matt. 1:18) Hence he was born holy, complete, harmless, without sin or iniquity, or otherwise imperfect. The birth of this wonderful Child was necessary in order for God to fulfill his promise concerning man’s redemption. It was necessary for that Child to be born perfect and grow to manhood’s estate in order that he might be the Redeemer. The hope of man for life is entirely dependent upon this great and wonderful event. Without the birth of the perfect One the ransom sacrifice could not have been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was born a Jew. The Jews had tried to establish a desirable government, but had failed. For a long time they were in bondage to other rulers. God had promised by the prophets that a Messiah or Anointed King, the Christ, should come. The Jews were anxious for the coming of the promised Messiah that they might be relieved of their burdens. They knew nothing about the necessity for a ransom sacrifice. Isaiah the prophet prophesied therefore, saying: “Unto us [Jews, and afterward to believing Gentiles] a child is born, unto us a son is given.” This Child now born, being the Son of God, was therefore perfect and able to do the will of God perfectly. God clothed him with power to save to the uttermost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet Isaiah says further: “And the government shall be upon his shoulder.” Thus he states that the mighty One would bear up the government; and then, in other parts of his prophecy, Isaiah proceeds to tell the Jews and all who would hear and believe that this mighty One not only would be the Governor but would rule in righteousness and bring blessings to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jews looked upon Moses as a great leader, upon David as a great king, and upon Solomon as the wisest man of all time; but now, says Isaiah the prophet unto them concerning this Child about whom ,he prophesied, “his name shall be called Wonderful,” meaning thereby that his name would become marvelous, that he would be a worker of miracles, and especially that he would vindicate his Father’s name and that his fame would spread throughout the whole universe and his greatness would far exceed that of anyone else. The prophet then adds that He shall be called “Counsellor”, which means that he would guide the people aright, advise them and teach them to go in the right way, and would lead them into life and happiness. Isaiah then adds that He would be called “The mighty God”. The Jews would thereby understand that their magistrates before had been called “gods”, or mighty ones (Ex 22: 28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font4"> but now this Child, when born, would be One who would receive all power and authority to act for God and in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the prophet also says that He shall be known as “The everlasting Father”. The term “father” means “giver of life”. Those understanding this prophecy would know that this mighty One would be clothed with power and authority to grant life everlasting to those who would obey In harmony with this Jesus afterwards said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Further, the prophet adds that He shall be known as “the Prince of Peace”. The word “prince” means “governor” or “lord”. This mighty One, then, is to be the rightful governor of the earth. “Unto him shall the gathering of the people be” (Gen. 49:10), and under his righteous reign peace shall be established and never end.—Ps. 72: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a great privilege enjoyed by Isaiah to be permitted to foretell the birth of the Redeemer and earth’s rightful Governor. Had he been able then to comprehend the full import of his own words he would doubtless have been overwhelmed with joy. Even greater than his was the privilege of the angels to announce the birth of this mighty One. The apostle Peter clearly intimates that the angels themselves did not understand the full meaning of the birth of Jesus. (1 Pet. 1:12) But they knew it was the outworking of God’s purpose for the vindication of his name and in behalf of mankind, and probably understood it was the beginning of the fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by Isaiah. What they did know thrilled their hearts with joy and they sang praises to Jehovah God: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of goodwill.” It was a still greater privilege which Jesus’ disciples enjoyed by being permitted to walk with him and for three and a half years talk with him and hear the gracious words that fell from his lips. They greatly rejoiced when they learned he was the Messiah and the Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But now a much greater favor is conferred upon those who are truly consecrated to Jehovah God in being permitted to know that this great and mighty One has taken his power and begun his reign, and in being permitted at this time as Jehovah’s witnesses not only to speak of his birth but to tell forth the goodness of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus and that it is now the time for the beginning of the fulfillment of the prophecy which in God’s due time will result in the complete establishment of peace on earth to men of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Blessed is the privilege of all who are witnesses for Jehovah God now! As these now look upon the works of Jehovah and his beloved Son and know that Christ Jesus is earth’s rightful Governor and has taken his power and begun his reign, they lift up their voices in song, saying. “Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.”-Rev. 15:3.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>FIELD EXPERIENCES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A BACK-CALL IN BODENHAM, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When calling to keep this appointment I was gladly received by the household consisting of a youth of eighteen years and his parents. Part of the lecture ‘Government and Peace’ was played, which they enjoyed, and I left promising to return the following week to let them hear the remainder. The following week, after listening to the remainder, the boy eagerly inquired how he could become an ambassador of the King Christ Jesus. I explained. The following week-end he was engaged in the field work, publishing the Kingdom. Gradually I learned how these people had taken their stand for Jehovah, resulting in being separated from their children. I was shown a news cutting of seven years ago, which read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘Attendance Orders Ignored</span><span class="font4"> — In a school-attendance case at Ledbury Police Court on Thursday, it was stated that the defendant----, of Suffield, Bosbury, England, had</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ignored two attendance orders made in respect of his son Edward (11) and daughter Linda (9). The bench adjourned the ease in respect of the girl, but the boy was sent to an industrial school until he is 16. This, the chairman remarked, was in the interest of the child.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few months ago the boy was reunited with his parents; so far the girl has not been reconciled to her parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“These good people explained that the only reason the children had been taken away was because of acquiring the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Creation,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government, </span><span class="font4">which explained the Scriptures and the way they ought to go Such came in conflict with the school teachings, and the mother paid many an anxious visit to the teachers on this account. The outcome was that Edward and Linda stayed away from school. An order was made against their parents. Two fines were paid. This did not satisfy the authorities. The day came when the children were literally torn from their parents, leaving the mother heartbroken. Now, seven years later, these parents have attended their first </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, the article under discussion ‘Persecution’. They maintained faith that all things eventually work together for good to the glory and honor of the great Creator, and now their son has been reunited with them and is fully determined to continue his fight for The Theocracy. These three honest hearts now contemplate being immersed by water, thus setting the seal upon their consecration to the almighty heavenly Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“REVEREND” REACTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Roanoke, Va.: “To one of the supposed leading clergymen : ‘Good morning, Reverend ----!’ Harshly: ‘Good</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">morning’’ ‘This is one of Jehovah’s witnesses presenting you the news concerning The Theocracy.’ Throwing up his hands in horror: ‘I don’t want it. I do not want Jehovah to be my God. I have intelligence enough to read my Bible and get to heaven. I do not want you to bring me any pamphlet. I do not want your human-made stuff’—shutting the door with a bang. I have met him in several homes daily and he knew who I was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">San Diego, Calif.: “I had two ministers to call on with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State.</span><span class="font4"> The Adventist accepted his with a smile. The Methodist said: ‘You had better keep them. I know all about that and want nothing to do with it.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Crooksville, Ohio: “A few days after I was invited by the local Methodist minister to address the Perry County Ministerial Association: they wanted the facts concerning our work and the persecution and wanted this information from one 6f Jehovah’s witnesses so as to get it right. We met at the Methodist church March 17. Five ministers were present; some were ill and could not come. The chairman opened the meeting and prayed they would have no malice or prejudice. It was explained to them that Jehovah’s witnesses began with Abel, etc. This, with all the Scripture citations, consumed about an hour. Then they wanted to ask some questions. The Presbyterian minister wanted to know if we thought none of the church organizations were preaching this Kingdom. Someone asked how we kept our membership, that is, how we listed our members. Jehovah keeps his own book of life: You have many names on your church roll, many of whom are worthless and are not recorded in God’s book of life, while a great number are, no doubt, written in heaven who are not on your books.’ To which the Presbyterian replied: ‘I am inclined to believe that all right.’ The others laughingly agreed. Then they asked why we did not try to convert the heathen, and not bother their members. They wanted to know how Judge Rutherford came to be head of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower.</span><span class="font4"> They expressed themselves as being for us in' our right to preach the Bible as we understood it. They all took the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> some almost eagerly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN BOMB-STRUCK BIRMINGHAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I called upon this young man in accordance with your letter. I took along ‘Government and Peace’ and also some books and magazines. He and his parents listened with rapt attention and expressed approval. I left three </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers </span><span class="font4">and two booklets with him. When I mentioned the witness work he reaffirmed his desire to ‘become an agent’. I arranged to see him the following Saturday. He turned up, having read the literature I left with him, and he accompanied me on the work for two hours. He expressed his delight in doing such work and was keen to turn up to meeting next day. He has promised to take part in a campaign next Saturday. Up to last Sunday he had been a regular churchgoer and communicant. After hearing ‘Government and Peace’ he said: ‘So it’s a mockery to go to church ’’ I said, Yes.’ So he said: ‘I’m going no more!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASED ACTIVITY DESPITE WAR (BRISTOL)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This was especially made manifest during the December ‘Courage’ Testimony Period, when a new peak of 164 Theocracy publishers was attained, the previous highest being 140. Having in mind that the Bristol stock of booklets was destroyed along with its Kingdom Hall only one week before the campaign started, and that the city experienced a number of major </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blitzes</span><span class="font4"> during the month, resulting in laying waste by fire and high explosive the shopping districts and to some extent many housing estates, the fact that the quota of ten sets of booklets per publisher was exceeded speaks well of the courage, zeal and unity now existing among the brethren in these last days. The campaign was certainly a joy to all, resulting in a distribution of about 20,000 booklets by the Bristol company and the Pioneer Home.”</span></p>

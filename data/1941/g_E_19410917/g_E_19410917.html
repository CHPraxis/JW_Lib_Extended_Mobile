<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesuit Morals </span><span class="font7">(See also No. 567, page 2.) ♦ It is lawful to use ambiguous terms, to give the impression a different sense from that which you understood yourself. A person may take an oath that he has not done such a thing, though in fact he has, by saying to himself it was not done on a certain specified day, or before he was born, or by concealing any other similar circumstance, which gives another meaning to it. This is extremely convenient, and is always very just, when necessary to your health, honor or prosperity. A man who makes, whether sincerely or in dissimulation, a contract of marriage, is dispensed, by any motive, from accomplishing his promise. Sanchez, Op. Moral. Precept. Decal., Pars. 2, Lib. 3, Cap. 6, Num. 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A son who inherits great wealth by the death of his father may rejoice that when he was intoxicated he murdered his father. Persons may innocently desire to be drunk, if from their inebriation any great good w’ill arise.—Gobatus, Op. Moral., Vol. 2, Pars. 2, Tract. 5, Cap. 9, Sec. 8, page 328. [According to this doctrine, any man may innocently intoxicate himself, expressly to murder his father for his wealth.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not mortal sin to steal that from </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">man which he would have given if asked for it. It is not theft to take anything from a husband or father, if the value be not considerable.—Emmanuel Sa, Aphorism, verbo Furtum, page 161.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a son has secretly robbed his father as a compensation, the confessor need not enforce restitution, if he has taken no more than the just reward of his labor.—Francis Xavier Fegeli, Pars. 3, Cap. 6, Quest. 11, page 158.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Servants may secretly steal from their masters as much as they judge their labor is worth more than the wages which they receive.—Cardenas, Crisis Theolog. Diss. 23, Cap. 2, Art. 1, page 474. To this agrees Taberna.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Subjection of All Mankind to the Jesuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS the announced purpose of the Jesuits to bring all mankind into subjection to their will. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font7"> in articles by Elton Groves and others, has recently made this amply clear. Every day now furnishes additional evidence of the accuracy of this view as set out in these columns November 20,1935, by a British writer using the pen name of David. Wilkie, who is familiar with the subject. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> magazine was . then called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> The information supplied at that time is here summarized for the benefit of the more than 150,000 new subscribers that have been added to the list since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Detailed plans for seizure of the United States government are worked out at the Woolworth Building, 233 Broadway, New York. In the Jesuit lineup the departments are called orders, companies, societies, sons, servants, fathers, congregations, institutes. In the Washington setup the departments go by the names of boards, corporations, administrations, commissions, councils, authorities, committees, banks, divisions, cooperatives, foundations, advisers, projects, corps, agreements, works, co-ordinators, offices, and acts. Great care is taken to make it seem that every act of perfidy is necessary for the welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman government lineup makes use of 79 sets of initials to briefly designate its departments; the United States government makes use of 82. It should not be understood that the 79 departments in each government represent, at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 17, 1041 </span><span class="font7">present, the same thing. But it is just rather nice, if you intend to take something over, to have some one group, or division, or order, or what not, that at the word of command can actually seize control of some particular office or func-. tion of government, as the whole of Europe has already been seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You have seen the initials of the Roman government lineup: AA, AR, CCJ, CFC, CICM, CJM, CM, CMF, CONGRO-RAT, CP, CPPS, CPS, CR, CR, CSB, CSC, CSCB, CSF, CSP, CSSCC, CSSP, CSSR, CSV, FDP, IC, MIC, MM, MS, MSC, MSF, MSSST, OCARM, OCD, OCSO, ODC, ODM, ODP, OFM, CMC, OMCAP, OMI, OP, OPRAEM, OSA, OSB, OSBM, OSC, OSCAM, OSCR, OSFC, OSES, OSJ, OSM; OSST, PSM, PSSC, RMM, SA, SC, SCJ, SDS, SF, ' SJ, SM, SM, SMA, SMM, SOCIST, SOSB, SPM, SS, SSC, SSE, SSJ, SSP, SSS, SVD, TOR, WF. Note that in the Roman lineup there are two departments </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(CR, </span><span class="font7">also SM) that have the same initials but different functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The initials of the American government lineup are more familiar, especially the last one in the list: AAA, ACA, ALB, AV A, BAPC, BOB, CAB, CCC, CCC, CES, CSB, CAVA, DAI, ECW, EHC, EHFA,EIB,EXECC,FAC,FAC.FACA, FCA, FCC, FCT, ECUS, FDIC, FEHC, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FERA, </span><span class="font7">FESO, FHA, FHLBB, FICB, FMC, FPC, FRB, FSHC, FSRC, FTC, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FTZB, </span><span class="font7">GFA, HOLC, IAB, ICC, IEC, JEB, LAB, NCB, NEC, NIRA, NIRB, NLRB, NMB, NPB, NPPC, NBA, NRB, NRS, PA, PAB, PLPC, PRA, PWA, * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PWAP, RACC, RFC, SAB, SAPFT, SBPW, SEC, SES, SLID, SLIC, SLRB, TEC, TEI, TLRB. TVA, TVAC, TWAB, USES, USIS, WPA. Note that in the American government lineup there are also two departments (CCC, and FAC) that have the same initials but different functions. How odd!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Like Other Sects</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Church of Rome is not like other sects, as the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, etc. It definitely aims at world dominion, with the pope as the head of an empire ruled over by priests of the Roman cult. All “spiritual” teachings and claims are merely so much eyewash, to help put the racket over on the public. The Jesuits have captured the Church of Rome; the pope is their nominee. They are financiers of world-wide influence. Behind the scenes they are the real organizers and financiers of every, totalitarian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are 400 Jesuit priests in Great Britain, and about 3,000 in the United States, and they are full-time organizers of the world-wide government they have in view. They know the innermost secrets of every Foreign Office in Europe, control the press, the police, the army, the civil service and the political parties. In America the two great political parties have each a Roman Catholic as national chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the course of its history the following governments have been compelled to expel the Jesuit order: Austria (twice), Bavaria, Belgium (twice), Berne, Bordeaux, Brazil, Brest, China, Denmark, England (five times), France (seven times), Germany, Galicia, Holland (three times), India, Italy (twice), Japan (twice), Linz, Lucerne, Malta (twice), Mexico, Moravia, Naples (three times), Papal States, Paraguay (twice), Parma, Portugal (twice), Rheims, Russia (three times), St. Petersburg, Sardinia (twice), Savoy, Saxony, Sicily (twice), Soleure, Spain (five times), Switzerland, Styria,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thorn, Touron, Transylvania, Venice, and Vienna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jesuits are the mischief-makers wherever there is a large Catholic-born element, as in Glasgow, Dundee, Newcastle, Liverpool, Bristol, Cardiff, the Rhineland, Bavaria, Tammany Hall, Chicago. Says Mr. Wilkie: “The climax of their machinations during the last 100 years is, they have virtually recreated the ‘Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire’ in the heart of Europe—Fascist Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland and Hungary, And these countries, as ‘swords of the Vatican’, are about to plunge Europe into war, to spread the power of the Jesuits over the rest of Europe by military force.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The striking thing about that statement is that it was made four full years before Hitler started on his campaign of the subjugation of the world for his Roman master. Portions of Mr. Wilkie’s article follow verbatim:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Early History of Nazism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are only two persons in Germany “privileged” to call themselves &quot;Leader”. One is Hitler, and the other is Baldur von Shiraeh, the leader of the Nazi Youth Movement. Both Hitler and Shiraeh are Roman Catholics. Goebbels, Roman Catholic, the minister of propaganda, the prime molder of Germany’s mind, was educated by the Jesuits. In 1923, when Hitler’s revolt in Bavaria failed, Goering fled to Rome. Later, in 1931, Goering was sent to Rome as Hitler’s envoy to the pope and Mussolini: “a mission,” says the German au-• thor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nazi?</span><span class="font7"> (a Nazi sympathizer), “which was highly important for the further progress of the National Socialist movement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font7"> Hitler says: “After all, the only infallible touchstone for distinguishing right action from wrong is: visible success.” This makes Al Capone a saint until he was pinched. This is the Jesuitical “code” of morality upon which Nazism, and Hitler’s philosophy, is based. This somewhat prepares one for the following observation by one of Hitler’s semi-admirers, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">An Eyewitness in Germany, </span><span class="font7">page 78: “Adolf Hitler has with profound insight made use of the Roman propaganda’s many centuries of experience, and National Socialism’s whole organization betrays the Papal Hierarchy as its model,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler is a Roman Catholic, like every other &quot;European ‘dictator’. He acquired his anti-' Semitism, so he says himself, from Lueger, a burgomaster of Vienna, a well-known antiSemite preacher, and a “devout” Roman Catholic. In the; story of the actual intrigues that made Hitler the chancellor of Germany there lies the truth about Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Made Chancellor by Papal Intrigue</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and later “constitutional” dictator, purely and wholly by papist intrigue. Hitler was not made chancellor by popular vote or voice. He w<sup>r</sup>as called to the chancellorship by Hindenburg after von Papen had persuaded Hindenburg to dismiss Schleicher. This is well known. What is to be noted is that von Papen, like Hitler, is a Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is amazing how this has been forgotten in the rush of events since. Nazism rules in Germany today, thanks to von Papen. Democracy has been trampled on, the Jews beaten, Karl Ernst, Strasser, and Schleicher murdered, thanks to von Papen, the Vatican’s Tay nuncio’ at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a matter of fact, von Papen, so-called “Nationalist”, and not Hitler, was Germany’s first Nazi dictator! Von Papen was chancellor before Schleicher. He, too, was “invited” to the chancellorship by Paul Hindenburg, without either parliamentary or public support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet this von Papen, whose party had won only 10 percent of the votes at the election, while he was chancellor in June, 1932, summarily “dismissed” and “forcibly removed” the Prussian cabinet led by the Labor ministers Braun and Severing, who had held office, for ten years as heads of an efficient administration. This, a year before Hitler became chancellor, was the commencement of Nazism in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bruening was connected with the Catholic trade union movement. To use Walton Newbold’s words, he was “always cajoling the Social Democrats, more particularly their trade unions”. Elsewhere Newbold refers to “the Catholics of the German Centrum and their allies, the Social Democrats”. These quotations are from Newbold’s book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Democracy, Debts, and Disarmament.</span><span class="font7"> The papist chancellors Wirth, Marx, Bruening, and von Papen prepared Germany for Hitler; and the Social Democrats, stupidly enough, made themselves the “allies” of the Roman Catholic Centre Party whose vote later on made Hitler the “constitutional” dictator of Germany!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After being elevated to the chancellery, Hitler held a general election. He wanted to win two-thirds of the seats in the German Parliament in order to enable him to abolish it “constitutionally”, to vote itself out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The “Election”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler obtained permission from Hindenburg to dissolve Parliament and to hold the election, but on condition that whatever the result the composition of the government, was not to be changed! ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can you beat that? Hitler was taking a chance to get supreme power, but he was not risking the loss of the power he already had!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No sooner had the “election” started than Goering got to work. He had newspapers suppressed for publishing a report that stock exchange prices had slumped. He prohibited the entire Social-Democrat (e.g., Labor) press from publishing a Social-Democrat manifesto !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this stage Goebbels was appointed to the newjy created post of minister of propaganda. This gave Hitler control of broadcasting and cinemas, and of the press, through a system of censorship which Goebbels introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then six days before the date fixed for the election the Reichstag went up in flames. Does any common-sense person doubt for a moment that it was set on fire by Goering? The effect of the fire was stupendous; and Goering, Goebbels, and Hitler made the most of it. The Communists were accused of setting the Reichstag on fire, and the Socialists with “complicity”. Van der Lubbe was said to have confessed his crime and association with both Communists and Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the strength of this imbecile’s “confession” the official press agency' announced throughout the length and breadth of Germany: &quot;Through this confession the united Communist-Socialist front has become a palpable fact.” In the course of investigation it was stated several weeks afterwards that the Socialists had been entirely cleared from the charge of conspiracy in the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Labor Press Squelched</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the strength of the fire scare, the entire Labor press, consisting of more than two hundred daily newspapers, was suppressed until further notice. During the last few days of the election Nazi speakers stumped the country accusing the “Marxists” of being murderers and incendiaries. Murderers? It is only non-murderous Nazis who coin words, or names, like &quot;The Night of the Long Knife”. Hitler stood forth as the “bulwark’’ against those “Reds” who had dared to put a match to Germany’s citadel of Democracy, the Reichstag,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still Hitler doubted the result. He wanted, understand, not merely a majority, but a twe-thirds majority, the majority necessary for the temporary elimination of Parliament. Again Goering came to the rescue. Under cover of suppressing the &quot;Red” danger, Goering obtained from Hindenburg a presidential decree which enabled him to establish an iron rule, first over Prussia, and then gradually to the other German states. Germany was put under “martial” Nazi law. Large internment camps were formed, and Communists, Socialists, Liberals, true Nationalists, intellectuals, state officials, etc., anybody and everybody suspected of anti-Nazism who could influence public opinion by pen, speech, or position, were thrown into them. The Labor branches throughout the country were kept in a riot of disorder by a scries of raids carried out by Nazis who were practically free from official interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite.of all this force, suppression, quackery, jailing, and raiding, ITitier did not receive an absolute majority. Out of G47 scats, he obtained only 288. Compared with the previous elections of November 6, 1932, the Nazis had gained 38 seats, the Nationalists 1, the Roman Catholic Centre Party 4; the Socialists had lost 1 seat, and the Communists had lost 19. The Government Parties (e.g., Nationalists, 52, “Other Government Parties”, 9, and Nazis, 288) held a total of 349 out of 647 seats. What Hitler had wanted was a two-thirds majority to enable him &quot;constitutionally” to eliminate Parliament. He failed to get this two-thirds majority. What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Reichstag met in the Kroll Opera House: Hitler introduced an &quot;Empowering Bill” giving the Government complete and absolute power to rule without Parliamentary control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And the Roman Catholic Centre Party voted in favor of it! This gave Hitler his necessary “tivo-thirds” majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hitler became chancellor, thanks to the papist von Papen; and he became the “constitutional” dictator of Germany, thanks to the papist Centre Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Murders of June 30, 1934</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hitler’s next task was to remove from office in the party every sincere Nazi who could by his position or prestige influence policy, and who was not prepared to sell Germany, or betray it, to the general of the Jesuits. This was accomplished on June 30, when about 100 Brownshirt officers were massacred (by Blackshirts), and also a number of non-Nazi patriots were dealt with, such as General Duester-berg and General von Schleicher,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">General Duesterberg, former deputy chief of the Steel Helmets, the German ex-Scrvice-man’s Association, was arrested on the night of June 30. (It was the practice of the Inquisition to make its arrests at nighttime.) He was first taken to Dachau concentration camp, and then to Colombia-Haus, Berlin. He wrns released on August 2, and said after his release: “I have not been shot, but I am a living corpse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Pope Behind the Scenes ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Broadcasting to Britishers on July 3, a Mr. Crossman, an eyewitness of the scenes during the Hitler murders, said that whenever he had spoken to the German people, from Munich to Berlin, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">without exception, told him the same thing, i.e., that “the pope was behind the whole of the trouble”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To bear witness that the Nazi party was on the wane when the conspiracy which made Hitler chancellor took place, listen to the following accounts of eyewitnesses, a Russian Social Democrat, a biographer of Nazism, and a French Marxian Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kerensky, the famous Russian politician, and anti-Communist, says, page 321 of his book about Russia, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Crucifixion of Liberty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> was in Germany myself in December 1932, during the chancellor ship of General von Schleicher. The Nazi influence was then plainly on the decline. In order to beat them finally it was only necessary to push the new chancellor’s experiment to its conclusion; in his internal policy he had the support of the central elements of every class in Germany . . . Instead of doing everything to support Schleicher, however, Hugenberg and von Papen turned to Hitler and almost pushed him into power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The (anonymous) German author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nazi?</span><span class="font7"> says, pages 23, 89:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The intrigue which overthrew General von Schleicher and installed Hitler in his stead had been contrived, not by him, but by other forces . . . His (Hitler’s) movement had undoubtedly begun to decline and was showing signs of internal disunion. Baron von Papen, whose mediation had brought about the change of Government, was (made) vice-chancellor . . . He publicly described the Hitler experiment as a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">detour</span><span class="font7"> leading eventually to the Authoritative State’ which was his ideal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lost Two Million Votes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Henri Ernst, author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hitler over Europe, </span><span class="font7">says, pages,12, 13:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At the end of 1932 it (Nazi party) lost 2 million votes and the Strasser group announced its secession. In January 1933 Schleicher was on the point of hitting the Hitler movement on the head and putting it under his own command ... In the middle of January a secret meeting was held between Hitler and von Papen at Cologne . . . the news of the meeting got into the papers a few days later ... At this meeting Hitler came to an agreement with von Papen. In this way the sudden fall of Schleicher and the sensational nomination of Hitler came about.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This, from three sources, is the story briefly of how Nazism got into power. Hitler was not made chancellor as the result of a popular demand. Germany was not in wreck and ruin. He was not carried to the highest administrative post in the Reich on a swell of popularity for Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his Merttens lecture, 1934, &quot;The Roots of Violence,” Mr. S. K. Ratcliffe said, with perfect truthfulness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The German people are profoundly antirevolutionary. During the eight years marked at the end by her admission to the League of Nations, Germany had rebuilt her industries and her civic life, had overcome to a great extent the destructive influences in the national character, and by persistence in the policy of treaty fulfillment (afterwards so bitterly repudiated) had regained in great degree her international standing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There wasn’t an earthly chance of a Communist revolt. Nazism was a declining force. The German public had rejected the idea of violence. After thirteen years of turmoil, tolerance had triumphed, Germany was becoming Nationalist, progressive, and more thoroughly, and sensibly, democratic. Schleicher “was on the point of hitting the Nazi movement on the head”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Germany “Saved” for the Jesuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jesuits saw Germany, and their vision of the “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire”, slipping from their claws. “Down with Democracy! Down with Tolerance! Up Murder! Up Dictatorship!” Von Papen and Hitler “saved” Germany for the Jesuits, just as Mussolini “saved” Italy for the “Holy Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Fascism” (meaning “Nazism” too), wrote Ludendorff in his book </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Coming War,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> “is a fighting instrument of the pope.” “Fascism is the offspring of the Jesuits.” “The ways of the Church of Rome and Fascism are identical.” “The Papacy and Fascism are inseparably united: together they constitute what is called ‘Rome’.” “What astonishes me is that the fact should have been overlooked that national socialism of the Fascist type merely means collectivism of the Romish brand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks to the Jesuits, the old “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire” has virtually been revived in Central Europe. Thanks to the Dominicans (the “Inquisitor-General” is always a Dominican), the “Universal Inquisition”, known by the name of “Gestapo” in Germany and “Ovra” in Italy (i.e., the secret police), once more rules over Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Italian Peninsula. But it won’t be for long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may surprise some people to be told that what is now made out to be the “creed” of Fascism is the complete reverse of the creed which animated the Fascists who marched on Rome, Everybody who knows anything about Italian Fascism knows this. Signor Grandi, the Italian ambassador in London, knows it. It is a positive fact that the original Fascists, the pre-March on Rome Fascists, Mussolini’s followers, were ultra-libertarians 1 (Before Mussolini became premier he wrote, “For us, only one thing is left, the consoling religion of anarchy.” To the workmen who first occupied factories he sent congratulations through his paper and in person. To those who seized the estates he wrote, “(dither the blissful landowners will be expropriated or we will muster the masses.” “We will carry on a devilish propaganda.” For further details, see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> November 20, 1935.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mussolini’s “About Face”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Black, and dirty, and foul as Mussolini’s volte-face was, and so far has been proved to be, one has to read his program in order to realize the enormity of his betrayal of his Fascists, and to appreciate how easy it. is for a person once established as a dictator (with the Jesuit machine behind him) to do anything even when it is the complete opposite of what he has preached, or reverse of the faith, or objects, or desires of his followers. The following was Mussolini’s program </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font7"> he became dictator, i.e., the program of the Italian Fascist party, published in 1919:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(1) National Assembly, intended as </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">tie </span><span class="font7">Italian Section of the International Assembly of all Peoples, in order to proceed with the radical transformation of the political and economic basis of Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) Proclamation of the Republic. Decentralization of administrative control. Administrative autonomy of regions and communes through their own legislative bodies.

<p><span class="font7">(14) Open international policy dedicated to the solidarity and independence of peoples in the Confederation of States.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fascists” Cheated in a Big Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would be out of place here to discuss whether this program is good, had, or indifferent. The point is, it was with this program that Mussolini got into power. The Fascists stood for (and the rank and file believed in it, you may be hure): no political police, no secret diplomacy, no compulsory conscription, freedom of speech, decentralization of executive magistrates, etc. !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You ought to appreciate now that Mussolini has cheated his “Fascists&quot; in a big way. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">man capable of doing what he has done is fit for any treachery, and any amount of it. It sticks out a mile that his regime is ■ the greatest swindle in history. I have given this matter some thought and some study and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">am firmly convinced that from the start of Fascism (and maybe long before then) Mussolini was secretly in league with “Rome”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mussolini gave the name of “Fascism” to the ereed he promised. What I want to know is, and what you, dear reader, should want to know is: What name must we give to the creed he has fulfilled '? It is not Conservatism, it is not Liberalism, it is not Socialism, it is not “Fascism”. No! It is Jesuitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Original Fascist Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Read the Fascist program again: (1) It is not anti-Masonie; you may look but in vain for any reference to Masonry in it. Many active Masons were in the ranks as Fascists during the March on Rome. The Freemasons in Italy' were a patriotic although anti-Papal body. (2) It is not pro-Church of Rome: one of its clauses is, “Suppression of Church revenues.” (3) It is not anti-liberal; if anything, it is ultra-liberal. It proclaims “popular sovereignty”, “freedom of thought, of press, of propaganda,” and so on. (4) It is not, strictly speaking, anti-Socialist. It demands nationalization of credit, the abolition of stock exchanges, expropriation of estates, etc. Lastly, (5) the spirit of the Fascists was “Italy First”, i.e., with emphasis on the “Nation”, not the “State”, and with no reference at all to the “Church”. So much for the theory. Now for the practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The “Revised” Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(1) Before Mussolini was in power three years he launched an attack upon the Masons, including those in his party, sent many of them to jail, and suppressed Freemasonry by law. But he didn’t suppress, and he hasn’t suppressed, the Roman Catholic secret societies by law, the Italian equivalents of the Knights of Malta, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Knights of Columbus, etc. (2) In 1929, from the Italian treasury Mussolini gave .a gift of nineteen million pounds to the Vatican. This was a part of the “Lateran Treaty&quot;. (3) He murdered Amendola, the Liberal leader; treated liberalism as “subversion” (this is the very word used by a Fascist historian) ■ and in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gerrachia</span><span class="font7"> magazine, 1925, Mussolini boasted that he had reduced democracy and liberalism to the state of “rotten corpses”. (4) He smashed every outward vestige of propaganda in favor of the ‘Socialist’ items in his program, irrespective of whether the agitation came from the Reds or from the Fascists. And he murdered Matteotti, the Socialist leader. Matteotti was an upright and a very popular figure. (5) Mussolini abolished the “Victor Emmanuel’s Day” celebrations. On the 20th of September, 1870, the Italian troops took possession of Rome. The Italian nation celebrated the day as a festival of national reunion, and, of course, as the anniversary of victory over the Papacy and Austria. It was Italy’s “First of July” and “Battle of the Boyne” combined. This is where Fascism shows itself in its true colors. The idea of Italian patriotism’s “insulting” Roman popery was naturally disliked by Mussolini’s masters; so the festival was cut out of the Fascist calendar. The Vatican,notltaly, came “First”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a mistake to imagine that only plumbers and dockers and “Rods” of various hues are lying in Mussolini’s internment camps. During the War and later in 1925, General Bencivenga was secretary for Cadorna, commander-in-ehief of the Italian army in the War. Mussolini interned Beneivenga in the island of Ustica, where the worst and most incorrigible criminals were lodged. It would have been more humane to have him shot, but to keep him living was perhaps the ‘‘better’ method of sealing the lips and palsifying the hands of his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Explanation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Now let me ask of you, What explanation can you offer for this total perversion of the Fascist policy and this attack upon Liberals, Patriots, Socialists, and Freemasons? Surely this is a question of some ' importance. Well, then, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">answer it,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> you Tories, Liberals, and Socialists! This is the answer: There is only </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> political body in Europe, only </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> not two, or. three, or four, which is anti-Liberal, anti-Masonic, anti-Patriot, anti-Socialist, antiCommunist, and anti-Jew. and that body is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesuit</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Society. “Fascism” (i.e., original Fascism) doesn’t rule in Italy today, any more than “Nazism” (or Brownshirt-ism) rules Germany. The Jesuits rule Italy, and their “creed” is now the orthodox Fascist creed in every European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“La Bottega del Papa”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not true that Mussolini against his will was forced to “bargain” with the pope. This is often said to justify Mussolini’s dealings with the Vatican. It is sheer, demonstrable nonsense. On the contrary, if Mussolini had put the pope in a boat and sent him to Tripoli, nobody in Italy would have bothered mueh. Before Mussolini’s advent to power the Church of Rome’s name in Italy was mud. Its prestige was low before the War; it was much w'orse after it. It was commonly called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“La bottega del papa&quot;,</span><span class="font7"> i.e., the pope’s shop, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">reference to the “holy” relic racket. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What Mussolini did was, he pretended to quarrel with the pope, just as Hitler is pretending. Most people, including the then “Fascists”, thought that this was fine. But the net result of every “quarrel” was a further concession to the Vatican. In fact, Mussolini re-instated Popery. He raised the “Church” from one of odium, which it richly deserved, to an institution of authority. And when he had completed the job, the pope called him a “man sent by divine providence to save Italy”. As no pope yet has ever worried much about “patriotism”, substitute the word “Church” for “Italy” and you will have the pope’s real meaning. “Sent by divine providence to save the ‘Church’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Vatican’s “Profits”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After seven years of Mussolini’s rule one would have expected that the internal condn tion of the country would he quiet, stable, and nonrefraetory. -The Lateran Treaty was signed in June, 1929. This “Treaty” was the Vatican’s ‘profits’ from Fascism. It was Jesuitism putting the seal on its victory. The resistance to it was the last ‘big fling’ of the anti-Fascist forces in Italy. They lost, of course. But the next time they cross swords with Mussolini (and the general of the Jesuits) they shall win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty, the words “toleration of other religions” w’ere cut out of the Italian Constitution. In theory Fascist Italy (unlike pre-Fascist Italy) does not admit religious tolerance. In practice it has to, so as not to arouse the antipathy of especially Britain and U.S.A. He gave the gift of £19,000,000 to the Vatican, already referred to. (I suspect this was the return of the monies Mussolini had received from “Rome”.) Above all, he re-established the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty. Do you know that the Vatican was very much upset because it was not given a seat in the League of Nations ? If you didn’t know this before, then you know it now. By re-establishing the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty Mussolini raised the Church of Rome to the diplomatic status of a “State”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mussolini closed down the Y.M.C.A. He put the pope’s picture back into every State school classroom. He cut out the words “toleration of other religions” from the Italian Constitution. He suppressed the Freemasons. Finally, Fascism re-established the pope’s “temporal sovereignty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no liberty of speech anywhere in Italy outside of the confessional box; and this just about sums up the truth, and tells all there is to know about Fascism in Italy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Children~~~the</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Most Beautiful Book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">CHILDREN,</span><span class="font7"> with subtitle “Their Training and Their Hope”, is gotten up as the most attractive of any of Judge Rutherford’s books. It contains 32 illustrations, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font7"> of which are full-page. The twelve chapters, entitled “Children”, “The Bible,” “The Creature,” “The Holy City,” “Princes,” “‘Other Sheep,’ ” “His Witnesses,” “Opposers,” “Admonition to Children,” “The Mandate,” “ ‘For His Name’s Sake’,” and’ “Glorious Earth”, are each introduced with beautiful and appropriate pictures which appeal to children and adults, not only in their design and in their beautiful colorings in orange, blue, purple, yellow, red, and green, but in the scriptures which constitute a prominent part of such chapter headings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though the title of the book might suggest to some that it is intended only for children, the fact is that it is one of the deepest, most thorough, most comprehensive presentations of the message of The Theocracy that has ever appeared in print. Not only every child will wish to read this book and look up the scriptures, but every adult who loves the Lord will find it of utmost importance and interest to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book has a romance in dialogue form in which a clean, well-educated, athletic young man and an equally well-educated, beautiful and lovable young woman, anticipating marriage, make together a study of the teachings of 'God’s Word and of their duties, privileges, responsibilities and hopes before and after Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dialogue between John and Eunice brings in 906 Scripture citations, and any person who reads these scriptures and takes note of what John and Eunice found in them will know what he must do to survive Armageddon and to have a share in the fulfillment of the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with righteous people who shall live forever to love and serve and praise Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reading the book for the first time, some of the striking paragraphs which catch the eye are appended, but they merely skim the surface of a book which few thoughtful adults will read without their eyes’ filling with tears; not tears of sorrow, but tears of joy for the gracious provision God has made in this, the Evil Day, for those whose one ambition is to lay their best and their all at His feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Chapter 2 the authenticity of the Bible and the authorship of all the holy prophecies are fully established to the satisfaction of any reasonable mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The third chapter is devoted to the consideration of man; his disobedience, his inheritance of death, and where are the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Only the Sheep Are Ransomed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fourth chapter is devoted to The Theocracy, “The Holy City,” the King and His Kingdom, the ransom and what was ransomed; who were redeemed, what is justification,.what is the “church”. Toward the latter part of this chapter, under the subheading “Sheep”, occurs a paragraph that is of special interest at this time: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who willingly obey the Lord he designates under the symbol of “sheep”, and those who disobey or oppose him and his kingdom he designates under the symbol of “goats”. (Matthew 25:32) Note, therefore, that Jesus says concerning the ransom or purchase price that buys mankind: “I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sheep. </span><span class="font7">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know 1 the Father; and 1 day down my life for the sheep.”--John 10:11, 14,15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chapter on “Princes” is devoted to a consideration of those noble men, beginning with Abel and down to John the Baptist, who died before the heavenly way was opened and who, in the resurrection, shall be for ever human on the earth by enjoying the position, responsibility and privilege of sovereign rulers in all the earth, acting under the direct command of Jehovah God and Christ, His King. Here are just a few brief expressions from this chapter that will be appreciated by all who love the memory of these noble men of old:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earth's Rulers Already Selected</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God made the earth for man and He made man for the earth, and in due time righteous men shall live for ever on the earth. They shall have an organization that shall govern in righteousness. That organization will be, not a democracy, but a government representative of the great Theocracy, acting under the direct supervision of the King of the great Theocratic Government. Necessarily that representative government will be visible to human eyes, and the people will receive the laws and instructions through those visible representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Since those faithful men and servants of Jehovah God have opportunity of a “better resurrection”, and since God gave his word of promise that he had “prepared for them a city”, that is, an organization, where will their eternal existence be ? and what position or place in God’s great arrangement shall they have? This question is answered in the following fieripture, to wit: “Instead of thy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FATHERS SHALL BE THY CHILDREN, WHOM THOU MAYEST MAKE PRINCES IN ALL THE EARTH.&quot;— </span><span class="font7">Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the sixth chapter the “other sheep” mentioned in Chapter 4 are discussed more at length. The following quotations are a taste of the blessings this chapter contains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who will compose the “great multitude” are gathered to the Lord Jesus Christ before the day of God’s wrath is expressed at Armageddon. Their selection takes place while Christ Jesus, the great Judge, has before him all nations of the earth for judgment, and that judgment day is the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How can one take his stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ Jesus and make this fact known? By consecrating himself to God and Christ, that is, by solemnly agreeing to do the will of God; then by performing water immersion, which is symbolic and constitutes an outward testimony that one is of good will toward the Lord and has taken his stand on the side of God and his kingdom. Then he must faithfully carry out his agreement to do God’s will by learning from the Scriptures the will of God and faithfully obeying what he there learns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All Should Be Baptized—Immersed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What the “cities of refuge” mean to these, and how they were represented by Jonadab in the destruction of demonism, are made dear. At the conclusion of this chapter Eunice, speaking to John, asks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Would it not be well for us to now make a consecration unto God and unto Christ Jesus and then to seek the first opportunity to emphasize that consecration in baptism, publicly declaring our covenant with God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John, in agreement, and in language that appeals to common sense as well as to the heart, responds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There must be much work for those to do who are faithful to the Lord, and we must do our part. You remember that water hole in the creek near the big sycamore tree, where we used to go swimming as children? It will be a delight for us to go there and symbolize our consecration by water immersion. We have learned from the Scriptures that we don’t have to be immersed by some religious person, but anyone who loves God ean immerse us. Both your father and my father love the Lord, and let us invite one of them to do the immersing, and all the family to go with us to that water hflle, and then we will be immersed next Sunday.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Chapter 7, “His Witnesses,” are taken the following gems:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore it follows that every person that receives the approval of Almighty God, and that receives from him life everlasting, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must be a witness for Jehovah God.</span><span class="font7"> There could be no exception to this rule, because God’s rules do not change, and he is no respecter of persons.—Malachi 3:6; Acts 10: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">AH who now truly offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah. They must go amongst the people and declare his name and his kingdom, and the message which such servants bear is contrary to that which religionists teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everyone who loves righteousness must take his stand now on the side of The' Theocracy and must participate in the “strange work” of proclaiming the name and kingdom of the great Theocrat, Jehovah God, and his King, Christ Jesus. It is those people who now hear his warning and give heed to it, and who turn to the Lord and find refuge in Christ, and who immediately become his servants, that will be saved,and receive his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It follows naturally, as a matter of course, that having decided to take their stand for The Theocracy, both John and Eunice would find themselves encountering opposers (Chapter VIII), chief of whom is Satan the Devil, represented in the earth principally by the religionists and those under their control. John and Eunice both see the dividing of the people under way and Armageddon impending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Should Teach Children? and When?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ninth chapter, “Admonition to Children,” contains so many treasures that it is hard to make a selection. Nevertheless, the following seem worthy of special notice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When shall the parents begin to teach their children? Preparation should be made before the child is born, by properly informing themselves. From the time the child is born it should be taught obedience, because to obey that which is right is essential to life. Obedience in small things, as well as in the more weighty matters, should be required of the child. As the child increases in years and in ability to receive and perceive the truth; the ’ parents should enlarge upon the teaching of that child, particularly concerning the Word of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foundation of the child’s education must be laid in the Word of God, because that is the one way that leads to life everlasting. In order to be equipped to teach their children, the parents must first learn. For their own good, and for the good of their children, the parents must faithfully keep their covenant with God, and that covenant includes learning for themselves and teaching the child God’s commandments. In this connection note the following instruction: “But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them, that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children; to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.”—Fsalm 103: 17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall the child be sent to the Sunday school of some religious organization to there receive instruction? No; for the reason that religious organizations do not teach the Bible, which is the way of righteousness. If the parents love their children they must and will instruct them at home in the Word of God and will take their children with them to the class or company where the Bible is carefully and systematically studied, and there require the children to sit quietly and learn; and -when they have advanced sufficiently they will let the children participate in the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parents are often requited to suffer punishment. because they teach their children the Word of God, but such suffering does not deter them from teaching.the child what God has commanded. If the parents or children are punished by the state for rendering obedience unto God’s law, then that suffering is suffering for righteousness’ sake : “And wdio is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing.” —1 Peter 3:13,14,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Punishment being inflicted upon the children of God because they obey his commandments will receive due attention from the Lord himself, and iirhis own due time he will recompense those who punish the children for obeying God’s law. Ue will avenge his faithful servants, and his due time for doing so is just at hand.--Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the parents claim to love and serve God, and at the same time fail or refuse to teach their children the Word of God, such course of the parents is certain to cause the children to lose respect for the parents, and thus the parents will be provoking their children to do wrong or to wrath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A child of tender years often shows itself as a good and effective witness for Jehovah and his King. The child mind is free from errors of religion, if it is receiving proper training at home from consecrated parents. Naturally that child speaks to others of the most important thing in its mind, and the most important thing is the Kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name. In simple phrase the child tells of the blessings that are soon to come to mankind through The Theocracy, and that, testimony given by a child is frequently received by elder persons, as well as others, and by them given deep consideration. On many occasions children have brought the Kingdom message to grownups in such a simple and forceful manner that grownups could not fail to consider it. The consecrated parents will teach their children to be witnesses to the name and kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Divine Mandate—Theme of Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Mandate, to which Chapter 10 is devoted, is in many respects the central theme of this book. This young couple clearly see God’s purpose, how Adam and Eve were disqualified and how Noah and his family were used in a prophetic picture shortly to be fulfilled. From this chapter the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The survivors of Armageddon will be made righteous. The Lord’s “other sheep”, who have sought righteousness and meekness as God has commanded, and who are hidden under the Lord’s organization, the antitypieal ark, will be carried over from the old world that shall suffer destruction and shall find their place in the “new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”. (2 Peter 3:13) Jesus states that his “other sheep”, who will form the “great multitude”, shall be righteous and that these go into eternal life, having received from him, as God’s Executive, the right to life. —Matthew 25; 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Now Living First to Qualify</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “great multitude”, then made up of those who are brought over from the present wicked world and who find life in the hew world of righteousness, will be righteous in the sight of God. Those who will compose the “great multitude” will constitute the first ones on earth since perfect Adam that will qualify to carry out the divine mandate to fill the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Should men and women, both of whom are Jonadabs or “other sheep” of the Lord, now marry before Armageddon and bring forth children? They may choose to do so, but the admonition or advice of the Scriptures appears to be against it. Being married before Armageddon and both continuing faithful and surviving Armageddon, their marital relationship shall continue and persist after Armageddon. They receive their right to life everlasting after Armageddon, and after receiving that right to life their children then born would be born in righteousness. Children bom before Armageddon of parents who had not received the right to life would not be born with the right to life, but would have the privilege of choosing to serve God and Christ and live if they prove their integrity. Otherwise stated, each one must individually choose and individually be tested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophetic picture seems to set forth the correct rule, to wit: The three sons of Noah and their wives were in the ark and were saved from the flood. They did not have any children, however, until after the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the eleventh chapter, “For His Name’s Sake,” it is fully established in the mind of the reader that the reason why any of the human family at all are saved is that Jehovah’s name is involved. What a privilege it is, and what a blessing, that, though the millions of earth’s population are rushing madly into destruction, God has a way by which millions now living may enter through the portal of Armageddon into everlasting life! From this chapter the following selections are made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of good-will toward God who are the “other sheep” of the Lord are now fleeing from, religion and from every part of Satan’s .organization and taking their stand on the side of The Theocracy and are joyfully pro claiming the name and kingdom of the Most High. Continuing faithful and maintaining their integrity, they will be carried through Armageddon in the antitypical ark, Christ Jesus, and will form the “great multitude” that shall receive' life everlasting on the earth and carry out Jehovah’s purposes concerning them. That “great multitude” will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. All these saved and blessed ones will be proof positive that Satan is the father of lies and that all his servants do his bidding and shall share his fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The children that now hear the name of Jehovah and learn of his kingdom have set before them the greatest privilege that has ever come to children at any time. Many of these children are fleeing to the Lord’s organization and taking their stand firmly on the side of his kingdom and are declaring his name, and the hope set before them is that they shall be members of the “great multitude” and dwell forever in righteousness upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, says John:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Some sweet day, Eunice, we shall have some children and they will be greatly blessed. The prospect set before us is glorious. Seeing that God made the earth for righteous men, shall we in our next study learn if possible what Almighty God purposes toward beautifying the earth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The concluding chapter, “Glorious Earth,” looks ahead beyond Armageddon, and, with delight in what is ahead and with true concern lest any might then fail to grasp and hold the blessings that will then be within their reach, the author says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All creatures mentioned in the Bible with approval are those who have been workers. God and Christ work, and all of his approved creatures must avoid idleness and busy themselves in profitable matters. The child Jesus said: “I must be about my Father’s business.” (Luke 2:49) When some criticized him for working, the answer was: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” (John 5:17) All of God’s approved creatures must work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Complete obedience will be required of the children bom to those of the “great multitude”, and all such will fear and obey the Lord with joyful hearts, if they are granted life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the “great multitude” will be a part of the one fold or flock of which Christ Jesus </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font7">is the good Shepherd, and since the members thereof must be righteous and shall be granted life everlasting on the earth, it must be that each one will, by the grace of the Lord, be permitted to eat or partake of the tree of life and live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Wicked Will Never Awake</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There appears to be no Scriptural authority for saying that the wicked will ever be resurrected. Hence the wicked, cleared out at Armageddon, will not come back, and that will be true with reference to the wicked in all times past. God knows who will be obedient to him, and he has in memory those who have a tendency for righteousness, and these shall be awakened out of death in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The final conclusion that this young couple make as expressed by John to Eunice is found in the next to the last paragraph of the book and starts in with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Our present duty is plain. We must now be witnesses to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. Our place of residence we can continue with our parents as long as it is God’s will to have it so, and we shall engage in the service of the Lord by carrying his message of his name and kingdom to others who are hungering for righteousness. We shall, by God’s grace, be forever the children of the great King, and our children shall be forever with us, subjects of the Kingdom. We have found refuge in Christ, and we shall abide here until the blessed time when we may have part in fulfilling the divine mandate. We shall not see each other very often for a time, but we can have like thoughts every day of the glorious prospect that is set before us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God speaks to the heart of the young and the old through this book of blessings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p><img src="g_E_19410917_files/g_E_19410917-2.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:76pt;">

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Vol. IV, pages 708, 710, says: “What Christian democracy is was authoritatively laid down by Pope Leo XIII in his Encyclical ‘Graves de commune wherein it is declared to be the same as ‘popular Catholic action’. Such a definition is certainly intensive; so that not everything done by Catholics, among the people or for the people, can be technically termed Christian democracy, or popular Catholic action. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Action</span><span class="font7"> in this definition is taken to mean an organized movement with a definite programme to deal with the pressing problems that come before it. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Popular</span><span class="font7"> has reference to the people, not inasmuch as they are a nation or collective whole, but as the fourth estate: . . . the movement proceeds along Catholic lines, under the guidance of Catholic leaders. . . . The Name.—After the appearance of the Encyclical ‘Rerum Novarum’, the rapid growth of popular Catholic action called for a suitable name to describe it. The old name, indeed, ‘Popular Catholic Action’, w<sup>r</sup>as both accurate and comprehensive; but a discussion arose as to selecting a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">nom de guerre </span><span class="font7">[a war name], and the choice eventually lay between ‘Catholic Socialism’ and ‘Christian Democracy’. ... In the end the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">democracy</span><span class="font7"> won; and Leo XIII in the Encyclical ‘Graves de communi’ (18 January, 1901) declared as acceptable and accepted the expression ‘Christian democracy’ as meaning neither more nor less than popular Catholic action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The May 31,1941, issue of the Altoona </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> reports a distinguished Cath-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">16</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">olic monsignor and professor of the Catholic university as saying to a large audience at the Roosevelt auditorium the previous night: “We should not be anxious to save the status quo of our democracy in its entirety because there are some things in the American way of life that are not worth saving. ... In this crisis it is not necessary to think of preserving the American way of life in its entirety. If we should wish to purchase a great glory we must give up a minor one to secure it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in America through its newspapers announced that the Hierarchy carrying forward “Catholic Action” is prosecuting a campaign, or “crusade”, for “God in government”, the announced purpose of which is to “defend the Republic against atheistic propaganda”. On the face of it that announced purpose sounds very good, for the reason that if the government were controlled by the Almighty God, such would be very desirable on the part of all persons who love righteousness. At Psalm 33:12, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.,</span><span class="font7"> it is written: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” The Catholic Hierarchy has shown plainly that its God is not Jehovah. On the contrary, the Hierarchy persecutes everybody who advocates Jehovah’s government. The Catholic “crusade” is very misleading, and that program cannot succeed. It is dangerous to American democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long ago Jehovah God promised that He would permit the Devil to remain in existence and to carry on his activities until God’s own due time to have His own name declared throughout the earth and then to exercise His power by destroying Satan and his entire organization. (See Exodus 9:16.) It was in the days of Nimrod, after the Flood, that governments began to be organized; and Satan was the invisible ruler of that government. From that time until now men have organized governments, and among these governments there have been many men</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font7">who desired to see righteousness control the governments, but no one has yet experienced a righteous government amongst men. The Lord Jesus Christ, who is to really rule the world in rightness, declared, when on earth, that Satan is the prince or “god of this world”, meaning the invisible ruler of the governments of this world. (John 12:31) The apostle Paul fully corroborates this. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Every government that has ever existed on earth has indulged in practices contrary to the law of Almighty God, for the reason that the invisible ruler of every government has been and is Satan, acting together with the wicked demons, of whom he is chief. The fact that there have been connected with earthly governments some godly men endeavoring to bring about a righteous rule is no proof whatsoever that any government has been conducted according to the will of Almighty God. Facts and Scripture are to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Centuries ago Jehovah gave His word that He would in His own due time establish on earth His government, which is The Theocracy, the government of Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus, who shall rule the world in righteousness. “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Won- ' derful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace,” and “of his government and peace there shall be no end”. (Isaiah 9:6,7) That is the kingdom of God, in which imperfect men will have no part. Long after that prophecy was recorded Jesus was on the earth. The governments that then controlled the earth wore not according to God’s will, and for that reason Jesus taught His followers to continue to pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Up to. the present time God’s government has not controlled men’s affairs. Satan and the demons, acting through unrighteous men, exercise influence, power and control over the governments of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 17, 1841</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures plainly point out that Christ Jesus, the Executive of the government of Jehovah, wall first destroy all of Satan’s organization and all organizations that are under the control and influence of Satan; and that God will give to Christ Jesus all the nations for a possession; as it is written at Psalm 2:8,9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now Jehovah God is causing His name to be declared in the earth by His faithful witnesses, and when that work is done the Lord will destroy everything in opposition to righteousness. The Theocracy, that is, the rule by Christ Jesus, will bring peace and righteousness to the earth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy can have nothing whatsoever to do with that government. No imperfect men will figure in its rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact is that the real purpose of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in America in carrying forward its so-called “crusade” by Catholic Action (so-called “Christian democracy”) is to gain control of governmental affairs under the pretext of putting God into the government. Its real purpose is to control the United States and rule it arbitrarily by a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mark this, that the words announcing the crusade say, “A crusade for God in government,” but do not say what god. Surely it has no.reference to Jehovah God and His government by Christ Jesus. The Almighty God does not depend upon sinful and imperfect men to put Him into any earthly government. Manifestly the god mentioned by the Hierarchy in its crusade has reference to Satan, “the god of this world,” who blinds the minds of men and turns them away from the true and almighty God. (2 Corinthians 4:4) It is Satan that is really engineering the aforementioned “crusade”, and his purpose is to destroy the democracy and liberties of all the American people. The only hope of the human race is The Theocratic Government, for which real Christians have prayed and hoped for the past nineteen centuries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">to file an appeal he was informed that it was too late, that he would be inducted at once and was expected to report for physical examination and induction. On Wednesday, March 19, he appeared at the induction center, hoping to explain his position to the satisfaction of the officials there. They brushed aside his efforts to explain, forcibly seized him, unlawfully “signed” the register for him and “administered” an oath (which Moncada did not take), and whisked him by army truck to Camp Upton, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As one of Jehovah’s witnesses, Frank firmly maintained his integrity as a servant of Almighty God, assigned to a task from which he could not turn aside, even though now “in camp”. Within a couple of days after his arrival at Camp Upton, on Long Island, he was again taken for a ride, to the United States Army Hospital on Governor’s Island, in New York harbor. After spending about a month there “under observation” by expert Army physicians (who pronounced him thoroughly sane, sound and healthy), he was released “on furlough”, which furlough was extended from time to time until he was discharged, on July 15, His “honorable discharge” for “faithful service” by reason of “convenience of the government” is clearly explained in detail in the accompanying facsimile of the official discharge papers, in which his “erroneous induction” is openly admitted by the Army of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Check for $40.60, payable to Frank, also shown here in facsimile, together with the $82.55 mentioned on reverse of the discharge paper, represents the Army pay (total $123.15) received by him, including the usual Government allowance for meals while he was on furlough, entirely at liberty and actively engaged in the proclamation of Jehovah’s Kingdom message, which he published also among his friends and companions during the brief stay at Camp Upton and in the hospital on Governor’s Island, to the delight of many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus is emphasized again, thunderously, the irresistible power of the Most High God as exercised in behalf of those who faithfully and exclusively serve Him in obedience to His written commandments. The shameless press, so cravenly subservient to that oldest and greatest religious system centered at Vatican City, widely and gleefully publicized Moncada’s abduction. When he was honorably discharged the press was silent. That was not ‘news fit to print’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In other words, Spain—the mother country of most of South America—is the real spearhead of Nazi attack and influence among our Good Neighbors. This was deliberately planned by Hitler as long as six years ago, and the results of this farsighted policy are now beginning to bear luscious fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Marquis de Aguiar, agent of Catholic groups in Spain and certainly no communist, this week gave eloquent testimony of this fact. Already Hitler has 12 divisions in Spain, the marquis said, and has sent four ships loaded with munitions to Nazi sympathizers in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">General Franco, whom the state department career boys helped install as Spanish dictator, signed a secret agreement with Hitler on October 8, 1938, by which Germany took over Spain. However, according to the Marquis de Aguiar, Hitler found it more expedient to use Spain as a blind to get everything possible out of the United States. So, for the time being, Fascist Spain was instructed to be neutral.—Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen in “Washington Merry-Go-Round”.</span></p><img src="g_E_19410917_files/g_E_19410917-9.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:74pt;">
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Hard Conditions at Ramsgate, England</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The conditions in Ramsgate [watering place on coast] are interesting; although Ramsgate [as of January 17, 1941 ] has had no night Kids, a large proportion of the people have taken to living underground. The Council, foreseeing the possibilities of intense air raids and bombardments, started a scheme for underground shelters before the war. There are four and a half miles of tunnels under the town; they commence from the top at the entrance to the town and extend right underneath and join up to a disused railway tunnel right down to the beach. There are thirty entrances, from different parts of the town, all joining up with the main artery, so that, in the event of air raid, bombardment or invasion, shelter can be had quickly from any part of the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many families have staked their claims and are already in possession; in some places rude shelters of curtain, tablecloths, blankets, etc., have been erected, and beds, chairs and tables placed therein, so that a certain amount of privacy can be enjoyed. 1 say “enjoyed”/; 1 should have written “endured”, for that is what it amounts to: the air is deplorable and filled with a fine dust kicked up by the many feet passing to and fro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T spent only two hours down* there and came away with mouth and eyes full of filth, and feeling very, very dirty. There were childrim playing in the dirt, and even canaries and other birds hanging up in cages. There is never any daylight, but always a gloom where the intense darkness is' broken by electric lights and here and there an oil lamp. We had our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font7"> book study in one 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of the curtained-off enclosures, the illumination supplied by three candles, stuck in saucers ; and, in order to read, a candle was passed around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font7">do not see how any can derive much benefit from a study down there, with such evidence of abject fear: there is no evidence of faith and trust; simply a groveling in the bowels of the earth to be free from the terror by day or night. The conditions in the railway tunnel, where the meeting took place, were better than in the main tunnel, where them; is no room for any curtains or enclosure —families just staked out so much space along the side and parked their belongings there; no privacy of any sort; one old woman of about eighty years was there in bed in the middle of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the main tunnel, which is about 8 feet by 8 feet, the lavatory accommodation consists of recesses curtained off and accommodating “pails”, which are emptied twice a wmek. Tn the railway tunnel there are proper pedestal washdown lavatories; and these were the cleanest places in the whole outfit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an open space there were the remains of a Christmas party: two bare Christmas trees and a piano covered with fine dust. The guests must have sat on the railway sleepers; for two tracks of rails run through for one and a half miles. Whilst there I saw an old man with a “fiddle” under his arm evidently looking for a likely “pitch” to tempt a copper or two. Tradesmen too come along with their wares, and most of the curtained enclosures bear names such as “Koxy Nook”, “10 Downing Street,” “Peacehaven,” etc., etc. There are smells —1 could use a stronger term—and at every turn there are added smells. Fish and chips, Irish stew, and a variety of other offenses. There is, too, a very good tendency to “scratch”; T understand that it becomes a habit, or rather a necessity, if one is down there long.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Leonora Roman, Puerto Rico</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ You will be interested to know that Leonora Boman has taken her stand against idolatry of the flag, and did it before she was seven years of age. Her mother gave a grand witness to the head of the school, a Baptist minister. He remembers me, because he has six of Judge Rutherford’s books, brought to him by members of his flock. He told me they should be burned because they are full of poison, but I replied that then the Bible also should be burned, and for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Leonora, because she is so intelligent and obedient, has already become head of her class. As far as I know she is the first child in Puerto Rico to take her stand on the flag-salute question. She goes with her mother witnessing. When </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 17, 1941 </span><span class="font7">her mother was sick, recently, Leonora said to her, “Mother, don’t you think the Devil is trying to hold you back?” and when there was a death in the family Leonora said, “Mother, don’t cry, she is coming back in the resurrection. Don’t you remember?”—Marie Hawkins.</span></p>

At Santa Clara T left a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> with an interested family, but I did not know that the mistress of the home intended to study it. When I made the second back-call, on April 11 [Memorial date], 1941, she asked me if I did not think that date should continue to be commemorated. I said “Yes”, and then said she, “Well, then let us keep the day.” I said, “All right, call up your friends.” She did so. I had nine records with me, and when I started to play them I had 46 people in the house, with so many more when the playing was finished that I forgot to count them. They kept the most perfect silence and rejoiced to hear the truth, and I placed with them that same evening many books and booklets.—Jose Clarke.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ I found one or two police here and there, standing around and looking at me so seriously. Having been warned to keep out of trouble I kept myself calm and busy in the service. When I had finished a certain part of my territory I came to police headquarters. The publisher who brought me here yesterday notified the police that I would be in this vicinity, so that they could protect me. So the police knew of my business in the neighborhood, and that made them pay attention to me when they saw me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ I went into the chief’s office and said, “How do you do? I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” He replied, “Oh yes, yes, yesterday an old man spoke of you. How long are you going to stay here? Who came with you from Cleveland? Say, it is all right, what you are doing, but we have some complaints about your people going around.” I replied that we are giving the message to those who have ears to hear but not to those who do not appreciate it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chief said, “You see, I am not a Catholic, but there are lots of Catholics in these parts, and many Catholics think that Judge Rutherford is knocking them, qnd they do not like to have his speeches on the phonograph brought to their door.” I said, “Ha, ha!

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Work in Chile</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Our radio contract in Temuco did not run out. After three months I was told that the “intendente” (governor) had ordered it stopped. I went and saw the head of this chain of broadcasting stations, Don Carlos Kaehler, and he told me to continue until he would advise me to the contrary; but the employees at the station began to make such a mess of the program (mixing the records, and once stopped in the middle of it saying, “Our</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">time is up”) that I had to stop. Then Kay Palm started in Puerto Montt, and after two weeks the businessmen signed a petition threatening boycott if the station did not stop..This made Don Carlos so mad that he invited us to come to Valdivia and use their main station, long and short wave, and this is still going since January 1, twice a week. We arc practically doing virgin territory, Kay and I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I find some here that heard in Germany, and others who have family or friends in the north of Chile. The Lord has sheep here too. Valdivia is called the “Nazi city”. It is said to be 80-percent German, but I find that is not true. It may be 80 percent German capital that is working here, but the Chileans have to do the work. When the president visited here last month, I found very few German names among those who were at the reception; so they are not of the upper crust. The Chilean-born Germans call themselves Germans, and not Chileans,, up to the third and fourth generation. Nazism has been suppressed here in the last two years, and many set over the border. The Chileans don’t want Hitler and are sure they can find one his equal among themselves. There is a literary war being fought here between the English and Germans. Every day I have to listen to the Germans condemning England for daring to oppose “our Fuehrer”. It’s fine.—Beta Hemke Abbott.</span></p><img src="g_E_19410917_files/g_E_19410917-13.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:122pt;">

<p><span class="font7">♦ America seems a long way off, especially in these days of war between the nations, but I am going to try to get these photographs to you, in ease' they would be useful to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> in any way. I have sent various items since last September, but maybe they have never reached you and are at the bottom of the ocean at this moment. I will try Air Mail with these. To me these photos are' a thrill, because they speak of the unity • and determination of Jehovah’s people in these last days to “gather together” and not to miss any special occasions for spiritual comfort and encouragement. They were taken on the occasion of our spring zone assembly, our spring offensive against the enemy! Only the night before we had one of the worst raids up here in Newcastle and many of us had been up all night on fire-watching duty and so were up already for an early start for South Shields, where the assembly was held. To add to our troubles in this city of Newcastle, the coaches we had hired for 8: 30 a.m. to take us to the assembly did not turn up and about fifty of us stood at the appointed meeting place for nearly two hours and then realized something had gone wrong; so we had to get local transport to take us to the assembly, getting there just in time for the immersion at noon. The coaches had been bombed; so small wonder we never saw them 1 It was a wonderful assembly, many new ones being present, showing the ever-increasing “great multitude”. Even though we were all tired, Kingdom smiles were everywhere and the patient endurance of the brethren was remarkable in the way they got there in spite of handicaps due to air raids the night before. I have made remarks on the backs of the photos so you can see what they refer to. We, here in England, admire and pray for the continued strength of our American brethren in the way they are so wonderfully standing up to mob violence and the wicked assaults of the Hierarchy. We feel air raids are much to be preferred to such treatment, but we can never tell what we can stand till we are tested, can we? And Jehovah gives us all needed strength, and soon, we </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">know,</span><span class="font7"> w<sup>T</sup>e shall see that glorious day when everything that hath breath shall praise the Theocrat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic H er aid</span><span class="font7"> of March 14, 1941, seemed to show that the Hierarchy began feeling the heat unusually early in the season. The explanation is to be found in the last sentence of the article:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Where Does the Pope Stand?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir,—It is now eight weeks since the leaflet dealing with the position of the Pope in relation to the present war was published. During that time 130,000 copies of the leaflet have been sold, and it will be possible to make a first donation of £21 to the funds of the Red Cross. Much of the success of the leaflet is due to the publicity given to it by the Catholic papers, and we feel that it is only just that we should pay this tribute to the work they have done in furthering the defence of the Holy Father. As orders continue to be received, we have taken in further stocks and, despite the fluctuations in the price of paper, will continue to sell the leaflet at the original price of Is. per 50, with special reductions for large quantities. It may interest your readers to </span><span class="font7">know that the Catholic Truth Society publishes another Bellarmine leaflet dealing with Judge Rutherford. This leaflet may be useful now as the Witnesses appear to have launched a new spring offensive.—Joseph Christie, S.J., Hon. Secretary.

<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Imaginary Mud-Waders</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ At </span><span class="font7">Muskogee, Oklahoma, persons who boasted that they had “waded the mud and slush of Flanders field and were wounded” attacked Jehovah’s witnesses for proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom message in their city, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Democrat</span><span class="font7"> of that city said “persons on both sides suffered bruised heads, lips and black eyes in the melee”. This is a serious challenge to the Muskogee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Democrat</span><span class="font7"> to name, and give the full address, of just </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font7"> of the slimy cowards that provoked this attack and who personally claims to have been in the front-line trenches of Flanders field or any other battlefield of Europe. An investigation will then be made and the facts published. Experience shows that the real soldiers, the honest-to-goodness veterans, never have anything to do with such demonstrations of disloyalty to America and her institutions, and few of them are foolish enough to have anything to do with either the Legionnaires or the Veterans of Foreign Wars named by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We Live by the Railroad</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ We live by the railroad, and when the hungry men come along we always give them a sandwich and a booklet about God’s kingdom. The men know about it, and one of them said recently, “Yes, all Judge Rutherford’s work makes good reading.” Asked how he knew it was his, without examining it, he said, “I have read enough of his books to know them when I see them: he does not pull his punches.” He put the booklet into his inside pocket, so it would not get wet, and was on his way. Thus the Kingdom message is becoming known to all men.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Glorious Summer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">• The censorate does not allow the newspapers to mention the weather suffered or enjoyed over Britain until after fifteen days; nor does it allow such mention in letters going overseas, until the weather is only a memory. The restriction seems sometimes to he rather stupid, especially in the case of letters which in these troubled times cannot possibly get to their destination until many weeks or even months have passed. Information must not be allowed to pass to the enemy,-and that neither for future night bombings nor of what he has done in the past. Very probably the enemy is always well-informed about the weather and wmather conditions all over and about Britain. Uis sea planes roam the seas and undoubtedly hour by hour records are taken of the conditions which determine wind or rain, and the sometimes sunshine. It must be taken that the censors have good reason, and definite rules to direct the many thousands who are engaged in looking through the mail matter which goes to and from across the seas. That its value has been proved is very evident, and that there is a sincere desire in the censoring to be helpful to correspondents is well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, now that June is well past, the newspapers are allowed to tell the people that which they knew by experience, that June was in Britain a glorious summer month, w’ith the hottest days for many years. The change came rather suddenly and was greatly enjoyed. The long cold winter season was not followed by the usual spring which makes England so pleasant a land. The seasons were out of joint, and there was a serious drought which served to keep vegeta-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 17, 1941 </span><span class="font7">tion back. But when the sun shone out of a clear sky, and the people had the benefit of double summertime, and the night 'bombers had found another task, on the other side of Europe, there was a picture of the happiness which can be enjoyed when the blessings of nature are received in the earth. The grand vision is of that which is to be when the great Theocratic Government rules in all things, when every heart acknowledges with gratitude the Creator’s will and His goodness, when heaven and earth are in full harmony. A glory yet to be, but.surely coming soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lull in the sharp and wide-spread night bombings continues to be a great relief. The enemy has not ceased doing this work, and in June nearly 800 persons were killed and as many seriously injured by this action.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Creator’s Promise</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">• After the. Flood Jehovah said, “While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.” (Genesis 8: 22) In the constancy of the seasons, each with its blessings, God has a witness to himself. Paul reminded the Galatians of this when he said, “God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: . . ..left not himself without wutness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.” (Acts 14:15-17) That word is still true, and will remain so as long as the earth remains, and that it is the permanent habitation for the children of men who are or become obedient to the will of the Creator, and are not of that “royal house” of the heavenly calling, is certain. (See also Jeremiah 33: 20.) “The earth aljjdeth for ever.”—Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no particular reason for thinking that the Creator, the great .Ruler in all His creation, was doing other than that which is implied in the wmrds</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">spoken to Noah and his sons when Brit* ain was blessed with weather which in great measure made up for its loss, so serious to it in the stress of the w’ar. The peoples of earth are the beneficiaries of His care for His earth, given to the children of men, who, loyal to Him, seek His will and its righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Undoubtedly Jehovah, the Creator, has often intervened in the operation of the laws of nature He set in operation. He did so to bring the Flood upon the earth to free His earth from the terrible corrupt race.which had so much misused His favors. He did it when in Egypt He demonstrated to arrogant Pharaoh, who said to Moses, “Who is Jehovah?” Pharaoh assuming that he with his gods was equal to any power. Moses could call upon. But the spoken word of Jehovah brought forces against Pharaoh, reducing him and his land to desolation. The Scriptures tell of several occasions when the course of nature was interrupted for the help and deliverance of His people when fighting for their freedom against their oppressors, into whose hands they had fallen through their sin. Probably God has done this same thing from time to time through the centuries when some bold spirit has tried to get a mastery over the nations, such as would interfere with the divine purpose in the end of the world when He brings His judgments to. pass. That His authority over &quot;His own laws in nature will.be used in the time of His judgments near at hand is unquestionable: His Word declares it shall be so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the seasons were arranged for the benefit of the land and for the peoples, and not for particular persons or parties who might think they had a special claim on the Creator, is shown by the word of Jesus when He said of His Father, “He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:45) The sorrowful thing, which will soon become tragedy, is that men do not honor the Creator, nor thank Him for His goodness. Men of human wisdom have led the people to believe that God’s account of His acts as recorded in His ' Word are not true. They wonder at the exactitude in the movements of the skies, the sun and moon and the stars in their courses, and in all that they find either by telescope or microscope. They see laws, but they deny a law-maker, and in this forfeit their name of scientist. The clergy of the Protestant sections of religion, almost to a man, support them in this infidelity. The stubbornness apparently must be broken by the Creator’s manifestation of His power.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Hitler as Religion’s Champion</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Hitler's attack on Russia and posing as the champion of religious Europe is a rather “nasty one” for the Roman Catholics iniBritain, as well as in other countries. But the Devil has to let go sometimes, and now and again a ‘cat slips out of the bag’. There has been much commotion amongst the Roman Catholics as to what course their Hierarchy would take, and when it was decided that the enemy Nazism was more dangerous to their cause in Britain than in getting half-hearted in accepting the country’s new ally, they, have continued as before and are giving full support to the Government. The Devil is a great schemer, and, as his representative Hitler shows, he cares for no other interests than his own. The Vatican Hierarchy cannot fail to wish Hitler success in his professed attempt to smash Bolshevism, the Number 1 enemy of Vatican politicians.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Methodists</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The Methodists holding their annual conference in Leeds reported the loss of or serious damage to 1,384 of their Trust properties, and much disorganization to their work, and also the loss of many of their ministers and official helpers by death through the bombings. All the greater religious organizations have suffered in the same way and by the same</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">means. The Methodists do not appear to be ready to join with other Nonconformists and the Church of England in the attempt to prepare for a “new order” to go into action at the end of the war. They have ever kept themselves somewhat apart, wanting to be nearer the Church of England in sympathy, as Wesley himself was, but yet with a standing of a powerful Free ehurclj, for separate action, as circumstances might indicate. Methodism in England is strong but is not healthy. Depending in the past on the religious fervor in militant evangelism, it has not had a “revival” for more than fifty years. Like the other systems, its colleges have turned out well-educated unbelievers in the Scriptures, and, like them, it is suffering the consequences. It has grown big and does big business, but it has little or none of the spirit of its founder, John Wesley. Its present president ventured to suggest to the parsons at the conference that Methodism is concerned more with the outward aspect of their organization’s life than with that which it professes to stand for. He said their sermons were not now occupied with'calling sinners to repentance, as they are devoted to philosophizing about the nature of religion and its relations to morality, to science and to politics. He called his audience to “face the facts”, now a common word in England since Judge Rutherford called the nation to do this when telling of the dangers fast hurrying towards the land and the peoples of Britain. The Methodists are going to try for a revival by a forward movement, whatever that may mean. They have got themselves into the jam of things, and they will find they cannot get out of it. The people whom they have educated are not such as will allow their preachers to turn to the simple “proclamation of the cross”, much less listen to that of the present establishment of the Kingdom, a truth which the preachers themselves will, not accept under any conditions. <sup>1</sup></span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>“Next! Please”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">A bare leg beauty parlor, believed to be the first of its kind in Britain, where women can have their legs sprayed with sun-tan lotion, has been started </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at a </span><span class="font7">Croydon store. The cost is low, only three pence a leg. Now that clothes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">in shorter supply, and coupons must </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">handed over as well as the price </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">paid, </span><span class="font7">stockings are getting to be a consideration. Probably the idea will catch on, and prove to be useful until the cold weather returns. In any case it is a new thing, and that is sufficient to commend it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Food Supplies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">• Apart from the labors of the Food Control to see that there is a sufficiency of food in the land, many other avenues of supply are being explored. Perch have been taken out of Lake Windermere in large quantity, to be canned for use later, and now it is suggested that the ponds and watercourses in Britain could yield at least 2,000 tons of eels, a delicious, if generally despised, “fish food.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Proposed Organic Union</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A British labor leader, Josiah C. Wedgwood, in a broadcast to America, proposed organic union of Britain with America. In other words, whether aware of it or not, he proposed doing away with kings and queens, with nobility and state churches, and advocated the free-for-all family fight which is the hall-mark of American life. Maybe it could be worked out, but it would make royalty sweat.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Invasion Frustrated</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ By way of Australia comes the news that the Germans had 60,000 troops on barges September 16, 1940, and were all set to attempt an invasion of Britain, when the Royal Air Force came upon them with such ferocity that their departure across the Channel was an impossibility. A providential gale is said to have assisted this frustration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">An Improvement at Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ There has been considerable improvement in Washington since the days of the late but unlamented Mitchell Palmer, In Palmer’s days (1920) <sup>K</sup>A Report Upon Illegal Practices of the Unitfid States Department of Justice”, signed by twelve of the most distinguished members of the American bar, opened with the following paragraph, the statements in which were supported by fifty-five pages of documentary evidence ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the guise of a campaign for the suppression of radical activities, the office of the Attorney General, acting by its local agents throughout the country, and giving express instructions from Washington, has committed continual illegal acts. Wholesale arrests both of aliens and citizens have been made without warrant or any process of law; men and women have been jailed and held </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">incommunicado </span><span class="font7">without access of friends or counsel; homes have been entered without search-warrant and property seized and removed; other property has been wantonly destroyed; workingmen and workingwomen suspected of radical views have been shamefully abused and maltreated. Agents of the Department of Justice have been introduced into radical organizations for the purpose of informing upon their members or inciting them to activities; these agents have even bee$ instructed from Washington to arrange meetings upon certain dates for the express object of facilitating wholesale raids and arrests. In support of these illegal acts, and to create sentiment in its favor, the Department of Justice has also constituted itself a propaganda bureau, and has sent to newspapers and magazines of this country quantities of material designed to excite public opinion against radicals, all at the expense of the government and outside the scope of the Attorney General’s duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The late Gaston B. Means was no decoration to the department, nor, for that matter, were Harry M. Daugherty, Jess Smith, or even Warren Harding, in those lovely days when prohibition was being</span></p>

Don’t laugh at that word “enforced”. A lot of money changed hands when there were some thousands of bootleggers, and great tales are told of the domicile dt 903 16th Street NW., Washington, where the change was counted in thousand-dollar bills. That was before Jess and Warren “passed on”, as religionists would put it. Jess suicided; maybe Warren was murdered. Who knows?</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Most Corrupt Election in History</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ On March 7 the Senate Campaign Expenditures Committee concluded its “slush fund” investigation, confirming the report that the Hatch Act was a total failure. It had limited campaign expenditures for each party to $3,000,000. Actually no less than $22,000,000 was spent openly, probably much more was spent indirectly through subsidiaries of state Democratic and Republican committees. For income tax purposes, big contributors give in chunks of $5,000 to many committees, making an exact total impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While there probably have been irregularities, frauds, violations and abuses in all elections of the past,” said Senator Guy M. Gillette of Iowa, investigation chairman, “I believe I do not exaggerate when I say that never before in American history has there been such an effort to debauch the American electorate through the expenditures of huge sums of money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What do America’s bankers, industrialists, and other rulers get for the ten to thirty million dollars they openly spend on a presidential campaign? The small fry are content with ambassadorships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mrs. Margaret Biddle paid $20,000 for Democratic convention books, she and her husband A. J. Drexel Biddle, Jr., gave $70,000 to the committee fund, and Mr. Biddle got the embassy in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesse 1. Straus and family paid $50,000, and Mr. Straus got Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Clara Discoll Sevier of Texas contributed $1,500; Mr. Sevier was given the ambassadorship to Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 17, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph E. Davies contributed large sums and got Moscow. William C. Bullitt put up $1,000 in 1932. He got Moscow and Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sam Untermyer contributed. $11,000, and his nephew Laurence Steinhard $5,000; Steinhard got Stockholm and Moscow. (Moscow seems the best horse; it paid off three times, win, place and show.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. and Mrs. Breckenridge Long made seven payments, $18,500, and made a loan of $10,000, and got Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph P. Kennedy contributed $10,000, lent the Democrats $50,000 (which he will never see again), but he also saw St. James’s.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact,</span><span class="font7"> March 17, 1941.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Same Old Loan Shark Story</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ It sickens a person to read in the papers about how a woman borrowed $50 from a loan shark and in 18 months paid him $4,395 in forged postal certificates and stolen money and still owed him $400 when the facts became public. You see the advertisements of these loan sharks everywhere, and you know full well this racket and the “Purgatory” and other disgraceful rackets could be stopped at once if the law-makers and the law-enforcers were on the level. The racketeers have and keep the inside track.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>A Real American</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A real American is one who complains about the laws and government officials every day in the week, but who is there when the country is in a pinch. Patriotism has nothing to do with waving the flag from the housetops or singing,“God bless America”.—Judge Lewis B. Eastmead, in Hudson County, New Jersey, Court.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Women Legislators</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ At the last election 140 women were elected to serve in the legislatures of 29 of the United States. This is ten more legislators and one more state than at the last previous election.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Vassal States of Northern Europe</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Norway in Need of Food</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Next to Great Britain, Norway is the least self-supporting country in Europe, about half of her foodstuffs being imported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the time of the Nazi occupation last year Norway had on hand supplies of all kinds of foodstuffs for at least two years; and of certain products like coffee and cocoa it had a supply for five years. The Nazis stole<sub>(</sub>most of this, so now the Norwegians have to starve; A large part of these food reserves were stored on board freighters, so it was very easy for the invaders to ship them to Germany. On top of this disaster, the Norwegians have had to feed about 350,000 Nazis for the past twelve months. When it is borne in mind that Norway's population is only 3,000;000, it will be understood that this is a great hardship.—Alf Tweet, in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Norwegians Desperately Hungry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Norwegians are reported to be des-gerately hungry, so say dispatches from weden. They have eaten so many sea birds that there is danger that sea gulls and other birds may disappear, and the government has had to take the birds under its protection. In the Narvik area only children, mothers and the sick may obtain milk in reasonable quantities, and rations for all others are inadequate. A hungry man is a desperate man and there comes a time when he risks his all rather than see his loved ones suffer unjustly.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Austrians Riot in Norway</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Austrians that helped conquer Norway do not think well of their confreres, the Nazi troopers. In the garrison at the Sala School in Oslo, where 4,000 troops are housed, there was a fight lasting three days in which great numbers of men were killed in rioting and in which the ringleaders were court-martialed and shot. News of this is bound to get back to Austria in due time and to make the Austrian people then think still less of the Germans, if possible, than they do now.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Norway Taken to the Cleaners</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Nazis have taken Norway to the cleaners in dead earnest. The usual annual budget of the country is 700,000,000 crowns, but for 1940 the Germans took for their reward 1,482,000,000 from the Bank of Norway. Also, they ordered the Norwegians to give them their entire fish catch for 1941. Large quantities of other materials were requisitioned. Norway is a poor country and all this spells ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sabotage in Norway</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Norwegians remember the liberty that'once was theirs, and, despite Quisling’s promises, resent their present bitter thraldom. When the Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler visited Norway to help quell the dissent, unknown persons derailed a German troop train in a tunnel, causing the death of scores of soldiers, This sabotage does no good, but it illustrates the bitterness of the slaves.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Hard Conditions in Denmark</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Hard conditions prevail in Denmark. Stocks of raw materials are low, so that many factories are on the verge of suspending operations. Substitutes for cattle feed are poor, and both pigs and poultry must be reduced still further in numbers. Unemployment is mounting, and many must follow the 20,000 men already in Germany seeking work in the only place it is to be found.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Netherlanders Catching It</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Netherlanders are catching it. Decrees have been issued io set aside Dutch ofiicials at any time Hitler sees fit, and to shoot any citizens that give serious offense to the murderers that have overrun the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

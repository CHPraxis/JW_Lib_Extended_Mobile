<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CHILDREN OF THE KING</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.&quot; —Deut. 6:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH gave instruction to Moses to be transmitted to others, the meaning of which instruction is now clarified to those who love the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah had chosen His people for the typical Theocracy and was leading them by the hand of Moses to the land of promise. Moses then stood before that people on the plains of Moab and delivered the instruction. Today Jehovah has chosen his people for the antitypical Theocracy, many of whom have entered the antitypical Land of Promise, and the remnant thereof have the assurance that soon they may enter therein.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Moses was a prophet of Jehovah and a type of Christ the King, that great Prophet, who executes Jehovah’s purpose. The words of Jehovah are not altered, and are heard with compelling force now by every one who has given his devotion to The Theocratic Government. Christ Jesus, the King, is present, and all who today are for The Theocracy serve under His command. Jehovah’s words, given to and uttered by Moses, now apply to all who would receive life through Christ Jesus, the King, to wit: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah: and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”—Deut. 6: 4-7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Today the obligation is laid upon every parent who is in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will to bring his children into the congregation, that they may learn the words of the Lord and may see their privilege of serving The Theocratic Government. The parents that serve Jehovah, and who love their children, will be diligent to instruct their children in the way of righteousness, that they may serve the Lord and live. The parents who neglect this divine obligation disclose thereby that they have not a proper appreciation of their relationship to the Almighty God and of their obligation to the children that they have brought into the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">* Centuries ago Jehovah announced his purpose to create and set up a paternalistic government, to be presided over by his beloved Son. That government is the great Theocracy, by which Christ Jesus exercises a paternal care over the interests of the people that shall live on the earth. He is the King and the Father of them that obey Him, and they, as His children, will address Christ Jesus as “Father”. Jehovah God is the King of Eternity, and the fountain of life, and none can get life contrary to his will. Jehovah has delegated to his beloved Son, the King, full authority to administer life to those who shall receive life everlasting. In these latter days the Most High has made this fact clear to those who have fled to the Lord and there found refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The mimic god, Satan, in carrying out his scheme to blind the people and to turn them away from Jehovah God, has from time to time set up a counterfeit paternalistic government, in which religion and politics are used to keep the people in subjection. Such counterfeit government claims to rule by divine right, but such claim is entirely false. Soon, now, such counterfeit paternalism will completely fail and for ever disappear. Counterfeit paternalistic governments have existed for many centuries in different places in the earth, and have defamed Jehovah’s name. Such governments, instead of being a father to subjects, have enslaved the people under their control. The real Paternal Government will set free all who desire to be free and who serve the Lord, the King of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Knowing the end from the beginning, in due time Jehovah began to make known His purpose to create and set up a paternal government by Christ Jesus. In the Bible God tells of the birth of the child who should rule as King and give life to others, and long before his birth as a man-child it was written in the prophecy of Jehovah concerning Christ Jesus, these</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">words: “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.” (Isa. 9:6) That meant that in due time a child should be born of God’s universal organization that should become the King and rule the world in righteousness. That man-child was born in a manger at Bethlehem and at that time the angel of Jehovah delivered this message to men whom God had chosen as witnesses: “Unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” At the same time Jehovah caused his angels to deliver to all persons of good-will then and thereafter on the earth this message: ‘Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace to all men of good-will.’ (Luke 2:10-14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> That means that those who are of goodwill toward the great Theocracy shall have peace and all attending blessings, and now Jehovah’s due time has come when all who are of good-will toward him may receive such blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>T</sup> As to the power, authority and glory of that child born in the manger Jehovah, by his prophet, says: “The government shall be upon his shoulder”; meaning the great Theocratic Government. That great Ruler shall guide the people in the right way; and as to this it is written: “And his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor.” All persons who follow his counsel are certain to walk in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ One of the names given him is “The mighty God”-, meaning that all power in heaven and earth is committed into his hands. (Matt. 28:18) He is called “The everlasting Father” because unto him is given the power to minister life everlasting to obedient ones of humankind. That means that those to whom he gives life and who obey shall never die, and those who are his faithful and obedient subjects shall live forever and carry out his purpose. One of his titles also is “The Prince of Peace”, meaning that he is the great paternalistic Ruler and his rule of peace and righteousness shall never end. (Isa. 9: 6, 7) The authority conferred upon him by Jehovah means that the territory of the dominion of Christ the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g-Father belongs to Him, and not to his subjects. The people will occupy the earth and glorify it in trust. That is a sacred and blessed trust, which the children of The King shall have the privilege and joy of executing. Thus the Lord confers upon his children a great and wonderful privilege and honor. This great King is “The Seed of Abraham” according to God’s promise first given to Abraham (Gen. 13:14-17), and He shall own the earth, and his children shall beautify it and use it to the glory of Jehovah forever. Christ Jesus became the King centuries ago, but it was the will of Jehovah, his Father, that he should wait until 1914 and then take possession of the Kingdom and proceed to oust the enemy. His first work upon taking possession is to announce the name of Jehovah and have his servants proclaim that name throughout the earth, and then proceed to destroy the wicked ruler, to the end that the people may have a righteous government under which to live and forever to praise the name of the Most High without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BY PURCHASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* By right of purchase the beloved Son of God becomes King and Father of his subjects that live. His purchase price was his own precious blood. He spoke a parable illustrating this, wherein he likens himself unto a merchant who found a great treasure hid in a field and who joyfully sold all he had, meaning his own human life, and with that price bought that field and treasure. (Matt. 13:44-46) That purchase includes The Government and all subjects who live under that Government. He tells of himself as the Good Shepherd, who lays down his life for his “other sheep”. (John 10:11,16) By that ransom sacrifice he becomes the owner of all who gladly come to him and ask for his blessing. To all such obedient ones he gives life everlasting; and therefore he is the Father to all who shall live forever on the earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> To disobey God’s law leads to disaster. That is forcibly shown concerning the first man. God created Adam and gave him the authority to become the father of the people on earth. To Adam and Eve God said: ‘Be ye fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.’ (Gen. 1:28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> Had Adam been faithful and obedient he would have occupied a unique position with all of his offspring. The time was when God dealt with Adam directly; and therefore if Adam had continued faithful he would have been a channel of communication to all of his children, communicating the message from Jehovah to them. His was a princely office with respect to other persons. By instructing Eve and their children in the law of God Adam would have occupied the place of prophet or spokesman for God and others. Adam was selfish, became willfully disobedient, and lost everything. Not only did he lose the right to life everlasting for himself, but he lost it for all of his offspring, and all of them by inheritance came under condemnation. (Rom. 5:12) Satan, the chief of demons, is the one who brought about the downfall of Adam, and such resulted disastrously for all the people, and, without divine help, in time all the people on earth would have perished for ever. That divine help was given by and through Christ Jesus, the Redeemer. —John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The Devil cannot thwart God’s purpose, who had made the earth for man to live upon. God made provision, therefore, for a ‘second Adam’, who shall minister life to all obedient ones, and make the earth a righteous and glorious place to live. (1 Cor. 15:45,47) By right of purchase, and by power and authority which Christ Jesus received from Jehovah, he becomes the second Adam, owns the earth, and will regenerate and minister life to all of the purchased ones who render themselves in full obedience to his law. Jesus says: “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”—Matt. 20: 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” The “many”, as used in this text, are those who have full faith in God, who are obedient and serve joyfully The Theocratic Government. Concerning that matter it is written: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:16,35,36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy, actually gives life everlasting to all of his subjects, and thus he is truly their “Everlasting Father”: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) Following Adam’s failure Jehovah began to make known hisjnarvelous provision for The Theocracy and the blessings it would bring to all who become loyal and faithful subjects of that righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">princes</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Under The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus the position of prophets and princes will be given to those faithful men of old who were witnesses for Jehovah before the coming of Christ, and who by faith saw the coming of the Kingdom or Theocratic Government by the mighty Messiah. Those men long since died, but they shall have a “better resurrection” than many others, which resurrection will come by Christ Jesus, who is “the resurrection and the life”. (John 11:25) By such resurrection those faithful men are the children of The King, and them as his children he makes princes, or governors, in all the earth. They were once known as the “fathers” of God’s typical people; hence it is written of them: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” —Ps. 45:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> A partial list of those faithful men is set out at Hebrews the eleventh chapter. When those princes perform their duties as the visible governors under The Theocratic Government there will be no more politicians, religionists or commercial gangsters to prey upon the people. Of. and concerning the King of The Theocracy, and of his princes, or visible governors, it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) The law shall go forth from the invisible King, and his visible governors of earth will carry into operation his judgments announced.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BRIDEGROOM KING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Christ Jesus, the Life-giver, has a bride, and he is the Bridegroom. His bride is made up of 144,000 creatures who have proved their faithfulness and loyalty to God and Christ Jesus his King. (John 3:29) The bride includes the faithful apostles and the faithful Christians that have lived since their day, and all of whom have died as human creatures and have been resurrected as spirit creatures, with the exception of a “remnant” still on earth who shall likewise have their change from human to spirit and all become joint-heirs with Christ Jesus the King. (Rom. 8:16,17) It is to such Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> By faithful obedience to Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus these faithful members,make ready for the new government. (Rev. 19:7) In Jehovah’s due time these faithful ones are resurrected and become a part of The Theocratic Government; and concerning them it is written: “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Rev. 20:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup> The glorious King, Christ Jesus, and his royal bride were foreshadowed in a great prophetic picture, which Jehovah made with Isaac and with Rebecca, to whom it was said: “Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.” (Gen. 24: 60) That means that the royal family, the King and his bride, shall see the enemy pushed out and they shall possess all the things once possessed by those who hate The Theocracy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1S</sup> The faithful apostles are members of the bride of Christ, and to them Jesus spoke: “And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” (Matt. 19:28) These words of the King prove that there shall be a regeneration of humankind and the great Life-giver to the regenerated ones is Christ Jesus the King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> The selection of the members of The Theocratic Government to be associated with Christ Jesus the King has been carried forward during the past 1900 years and is now practically completed. The Lord Jesus received the Kingdom and began his rule in 1914, and in A.D. 1918 he began the judgment of those consecrated to do God’s will, selecting those faithful and approved ones whom he has sent forth as his servants to be witnesses to the great Theocrat, his name and his government. The remnant of these are yet on the earth, and these must join and do gladly join with Christ Jesus to extend the invitation to all persons of good-will now on earth to come and take freely of the truth of life; and those obeying shall live. (Rev. 22:17) Thus the heavenly generation bring the life message to the earthly generation; and concerning such it is written: “One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.”—Ps. 145: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER CHILDREN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> After telling of the faithful spiritual company, whom Jesus purchased with his own blood, and who shall be associated with him in The Theocratic Government, Jesus says: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:16) The “other sheep” of the Lord here mentioned are the ones who shall form the “great multitude” and live forever on the earth. (Rev. 7:9-17) They will experience regeneration. A multitude of such persons are now living on the earth, and these hearing the message of life respond gladly and, proving their integrity, they shall live and never die. That blessed multitude was pictured by the sons of Noah that were carried safely over the flood with their father Noah. There Noah pictured the great Life-giver. After the flood all nations of earth were from Noah their father. (Genesis 10) So likewise the people that are carried over Armageddon and who form the “great multitude”, together with all others that live after Armageddon, shall be from the King-Father, Christ Jesus. The name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus are now being proclaimed in the earth, and many are hearing and hastening to declare themselves for the Theocratic government of righteousness. These who hear and obey are the prospective children of the King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Such persons of good-will who embrace The Theocracy now see that Christ Jesus the King has come and that his long-promised government of righteousness is now at hand. They hail and praise Christ Jesus the King and seek life through him, just as this was pictured by a multitude of children in Jerusalem who filled the temple and cried to Jesus: “Hosanna to the son of David!” (Matt. 21:15) On that occasion the religionists tried to silence the children, but Jesus in words of rebuke said to them: “Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” (Matt. 21:16) Today the children of the King joyfully hail Christ Jesus, proclaiming The Theocratic Government; and the religionists of the present time try to silence these children, but they cannot. God can make the very stones to cry out, and he will see to it that his children shall now herald the message before the people who desire to hear. The religionists have lost their opportunity, and now the children, by the Lord’s favor, take up the glad song and herald it far and wide, and, as the Lord declares, this is done to put the enemy to silence. The children are now in the favor of the Lord and joyfully serve him, and they shall see the enemies of The Theocracy go down to defeat.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNE TIME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Long ago Jehovah fixed the time and season to carry out his purpose concerning The Theocracy, and in his due time each progressive step takes place. When the due time arrives the Lord instructs his teachable and obedient ones in the way that they should go, and to that end he makes clear to such the meaning of his Word; as he has promised: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lor4 are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.” —Ps. 25:9,10,12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Every child that now gives his heart devotion to Jehovah and Christ the King may confidently expect to be guided in the right way, because now is the Lord’s due time to gather unto himself his “other sheep”. It was in the year 1914 that Jehovah instructed Christ Jesus to begin his duties of his Kingly office, and concerning which it is written: “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”— Ps. 110:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> The first work of the King is to cause his faithful servants to proclaim the name of Jehovah, the Supreme One, and to tell of his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and, when that is done, then to oust the Satanic rule; and which will be accomplished at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Since 1918 the Lord of glory and power has been judging the nations; as it is written: “And before </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.”—Matt. 25: 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> It is not at all necessary for the people to see the Lord with their eyes in order to be judged by him. He is there, invisible to human eyes, and he judges them by their heart devotion or motive exhibited when they hear of his kingdom. During that judgment the prospective children of the King, which he calls his “other sheep”, are separated from the disobedient ones, which he calls “goats”, and his “other sheep” are placed on the side of the King’s favor and saving power: “And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.”—Matt. 25: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> The Lord compels no one to serve him, but he offers his blessings to those who desire to do right and who are anxious to see the righteous government in full control of the world. Such prospective children are diligent to learn what is the Lord’s will concerning them and they hasten to do the will of the Lord. Because they took the side of The Theocracy and have proclaimed the name of the great King, they are bitterly opposed by the demons and demonized men. The prospective children of the King must, under that crucial test, remain firm and steadfast for the King and his kingdom, and, if they do so until the test is completed at Armageddon, “then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matt. 25: 34) Thus they become the children of the “Everlasting Father” and enter into the abundant blessings which Jehovah has prepared for them from the foundation of the world. Note some of these great blessings that he named in the Scriptures.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Jehovah God gave to Adam, the perfect man, dominion over certain specific things. The fact that Adam lost that blessing by disobedience means that the Lord’s obedient children shall receive that dominion from the hand of the Lord, and which corresponds exactly with the dominion given to perfect Adam in Eden. (Gen. 1: 26, 28) Everything then will be under the control of Christ the King; and his children shall carry out the things given to Adam, and which he lost. Concerning this it is written: “For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.”—Heb. 2: 5-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“Before taking control of the earth Jesus first purchased with his lifeblood all obedient ones, and then he comes in glory and honor and power as </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g of Jehovah’s Government and takes charge of all things under The Theocracy. Hence it is written: “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” (Heb. 2: 9) He purchases all who become his children subjects.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> These children include the “princes” and those of the “great multitude”. Thus the visible representatives and the children of their Father, the King, will exercise dominion over the earth, over the fish, and the fowls, and all the beasts of the forest and of the field. The Lord gives His guarantee that none of the beasts or other animal creation shall hurt or do violence to his children. As an example, a young lamb will become very much attached to the lion, and all the animals and all the children will become real friends, as it is written: “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on. the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isa. 11: 6-9) There shall then be everlasting peace between man and beast, as is declared by the Lord: “And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.”—Hos. 2:18; Ezek. 34:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The children of the King shall be used by the Lord to make the earth a place of glory and beauty. (Isa. 60:13; 66:1) Tended and kept by his princes and his children subjects, the earth shall become the King’s garden, a paradise of which Eden was a type, and everything therein will proclaim the praises of the Most High and of the King.—Gen. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MANDATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> Now the nations of the earth are in the throes of death, and soon Armageddon, the battle of that great day of God Almighty, will be fought, and in which Christ shall be completely victorious, pushing out and destroying every wicked thing. In that battle the wicked and all the oppressors and all the opposers of The Theocracy shall perish. Then the survivors of Armageddon, the “great multitude”, the children of the King, shall carry out the divine mandate, which God gave to Adam and which Adam lost because of his disobedience.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” God’s purpose cannot fail. (Isa. 46:11) He has given his word that the earth shall be populated with righteous people. The sons of Noah made a picture related to that divine mandate as carried out. (Gen. 9:1) The children of the King shall fulfill that divine mandate in reality and completeness to the glory of the Lord. To the children of the King that mandate is: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.” Thus shall be performed by the obedient children of the King the greatest privilege ever set before human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup>‘ The fulfillment of that divine mandate is one of the many blessings now set before the Jonadabs, as the obedient, prospective children of the King, and they shall carry it into execution to the glory of God and of the King when Armageddon is passed. Righteous creatures shall perform and fulfill that mandate of righteousness, and they shall do so under the supervision of the King of righteousness. Under his supervision the children of the King forming the “great multitude” will marry and bring forth children in righteousness, which offspring also shall be children of the King. “They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.” (Isa. 65: 23) Thus the earth, under the ruler-, ship of The Theocratic Government, shall be filled with people in perfection that shall forever honor and praise the name of Jehovah and the name of his King. They will be the people of the Lord, and he will be their God and Life-giver. Then the babes shall not sicken and die. Each one shall be given a full opportunity to prove his complete devotion to the King and Jehovah, and if any die it will be only because of their own willful disobedience, and for such there will be no tears of sorrow shed.—Rev. 21:4; Ezek. 24:16-18; also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font6"> Book One, pages 332-334.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’“Marriage is a divine institution and therefore made sacred by Almighty God. Under the rulership of the wicked marriage has become a mockery. Under the rule of the King of The Theocracy marriage will become sacred and to the glory of God. In the days of old the typical covenant people of God, who loved him, looked to the Lord to guide in the selection of a wife for the man. (Gen. 24:1-67) This is at least a suggestion that under The Theocracy men and women will seek the face of the Lord, the King, and beseech him to make the selection of the wife for the husband. Since Armageddon is near at hand it would seem wise for those who hope to be of the “great multitude”, and therefore to fulfill the divine mandate, to wait upon the Lord and seek his direction and ask him to guide them and make selection of a companion. As the “great multitude” will carry out the divine mandate in righteousness they will need and greatly desire the direction of their “Wonderful Counsellor”, the King of glory, and he is certain to guide those who earnestly seek his counsel and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The “great multitude” will bring forth children in righteousness to the honor of the King. Relating to this it is written: “In the multitude of people is the King’s honour; but in the want of [the] people [which now prevails in all the earth] is the destruction of the prince [the wicked prince, ‘the god of this world,’ and his supporters].”—Prov. 14:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">”■ Under the reign of Christ the King the “great multitude”, as children of the King, shall rejoice to bring forth children and to teach them the way of righteousness that they may live forever in righteousness. Concerning this it is written : “Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.” (Ps. 127:3-5) Today those who love Jehovah and his King are not ashamed to proclaim The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, but serenely and joyfully speak to their opponents, telling them of the gracious things God has in store for those who joyfully serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PARENTS’ DUTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’’When Moses stood before Jehovah’s typical covenant people on the plains of Moab and delivered the instruction from Jehovah he knew that soon thereafter the children, then present, would take the place of their parents in the ranks of God’s army. Forcibly he urgently reminded the parents of their duty to their children. He urged upon them diligence and faithfulness in teaching the truth to their children. That was important then; the fulfillment thereof is of greater importance now. Today Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, has gathered his covenant people before him and in the most forceful way tells them to instruct their children in the way of righteousness by constantly keeping before their children the name of Jehovah, his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and the necessity of complete and unselfish devotion to Jehovah and his government. We know that in the very near future the last members of the governmental associates with Christ Jesus must leave behind their children and go on to higher duties and service. It will be the blessed privilege of the faithful children, under the direct lead of the faithful “princes” or governors in the earth, to carry into action the divine mandate toward filling the earth with a righteous people. Let the parents now who are in a covenant for the Kingdom see to it that they are obedient to God’s commandment to be diligent to teach their children of and concerning The Theoc</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">racy. In this do not fail! The greatest favor the parents can now bestow upon their children is to keep constantly before them the Kingdom and what it means to humankind. If such parents have brought up their children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” they will not depart from that training, and blessed shall be those parents and children who thus obey!—Eph. 6:4; Prov. 22: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DUTY OF CHILDREN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">** Those who are children of the anointed, and who desire to live, must keep always in mind this admonition of God’s Word: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.” (Eph. 6:1) Those words mean that the children must give heed to the instruction they receive from their parents who are in the Lord and who obey the Lord’s injunction. Furthermore it is written: “Honour thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.”—Eph. 6: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&lt;0 “Everlasting Father” of these children is Christ Jesus, and their real mother is the Lord’s capital organization. If you children have shown diligence and efficiency in the schools of this world, with stronger reasoning you must now be diligent to grow efficient in the school under The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> You may soon meet with Abraham, Daniel, and other like faithful men, who shall be here as perfect men acting as governors of the new world. Eagerly seek their instruction and hang on their words of wisdom and grace, because they will lead you in the way of righteousness. Rest confidently in their leadership because they are the Lord’s princes. Referring to their coming as the righteous governors Jesus says: “Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 8:11) Sitting with them does not mean remaining inactive, but does mean to rest in complete confidence with them, knowing that they are right and, being with them, you are walking in the way of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> Your present-day duty is that of great weight and responsibility. Christ Jesus, the King, is here, fully prepared and equipped for the battle of Armageddon, and there His enemies shall bite the dust. Before he executes that judgment with great power, he commands that all who love him shall be actively engaged in proclaiming The Theocracy to the praise of Jehovah. (Ex. 9:16) If you hope to live, and you now love the “Everlasting Father”, the King, you will willingly and joyfully give heed to his words and obey him; as it is written: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110: 3) Are you willing to fully perform your duty? Hear then the commandment of the Lord set forth in the Bible at Revelation 22:17: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font6">d let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> Christ the King is that great Spirit, and his bride there mentioned is the body members of his government; and you are the prospective children of the King, and as such may live forever on the earth. “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.” Come where? Come to and take your stand firmly on the side of The Theocratic Government. In the language of Jesus: “Flee to the mountains”; that is, to God and Christ Jesus, the great Theocrat and his King. If you hear and obey, then to you the King says: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” So “say” you to whom? Thus “say” to all who will hear the message concerning The Theocracy. That means that you must now be diligent and very active to make known the name of the King and of the great Theocracy and the Almighty Theocrat. For what purpose must that message now be delivered? Jesus answers that all who desire righteousness and life may now dome and put themselves under the protection of the Lord and find the way to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOVERNMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> The apostle, under inspiration from the Lord, long ago wrote these prophetic words: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) The “new heavens” are The Theocratic Government, the invisible ruling power in the hands of Christ; and that government has come. The “new earth” is the new rule under the princes of the King of glory; and these princes are due to come any day. That is the righteous rule or government concerning which Jehovah caused to be written in his Bible: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.” (Prov. 29:2) Such is a guarantee from Jehovah that the day of joy for the people is just ahead and that all who obey the law of The Theocratic Government shall rejoice forevermore.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> That prophecy in the way of fulfillment is a flash of light from heaven now given when darkness covers the wicked rule of this world and gross darkness &gt;has settled down upon all the nations. It is a beacon light of hope to all who love righteousness. As prospective children of the King it is now your great privilege and bounden duty to hasten to carry out the commandment of the Lord by carrying Jehovah’s message of hope to the peoples of the earth who will hear. By doing so willingly, confidently and without fear of demons or men, you will prove your love for the great Theocrat and his King in this day of judgment.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>46</sup> The rule of the nations by present-day dictators holds out no hope whatsoever for humankind. All nations are now afflicted with war, famine, pestilence, sickness and death. It is your privilege and duty to now lift high the standard of The Theocracy and, as sweet singers of the new world, point the willing people to the way of safety and to life. Under the rule of The Theocracy there shall never be another war amongst men, because the Lord God has given His word that peace shall persist forevermore. (Isa. 9:7) The righteous King shall rule in equity, and every obedient one shall stand equal with every other one before the Lord. The people will unselfishly work together, and “they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”—Mic. 4: 3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> Famine and want will be unknown under The Theocratic Government. There shall be plenty for all and all shall eat their food in joy and contentment ; as it is written; “And in this mountain [Theo</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">cratic Government] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. He will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it.”—Isa. 25: 6, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> The great and long-hoped-for Theocracy has come! Lift up your heads with joy. Go now and tell the glad tidings of The Theocratic Government to all who will hear. Those who do hear and obey will join in the everlasting praise of Jehovah now being sounded in the heavens; as is written in the prophecy of the Most High: “Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl; Kings of the earth [Christ and his bride], and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth [the visible representatives on earth of The Theocratic Government] ; both young men and maidens; old men [survivors of Armageddon] and children [born of the ‘great multitude’ to fill the earth]: let them praise the name of the Lord [JEHOVAH] : for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.”—Ps. 148:10-14.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A KINGDOM PRAYER</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font5">ITH many prayer is merely a formality performed mainly in some religious building. With others it is a mockery. Some pray to be heard of men, over the radio or elsewhere in public. A few pray with a sincere desire to have the will of their Maker and God done concerning them. Such was evidently the reason why the disciples of the great Teacher Jesus requested him to teach them how to pray. If it was necessary for the apostles of Jesus to learn how to pray, surely it is necessary for all to learn how to pray intelligently who expect to have their prayers answered. Now what is the proper method for such to use in praying?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer to this should be found in the Scriptures, and nowhere else. Luke 11:1 records: “And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John [the Baptist] also taught his disciples.” Jesus answered : “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” (Matthew 6:9) It is observed that here Jesus directed that the prayer shall be addressed to Him “whose name alone is Jehovah”, and who shall be addressed as Father. (Ps. 83:18) This does not mean the fatherhood of God to all mankind, nor the brotherhood of all men, as some religious men have foolishly taught. Jehovah God is the Father to those only who have been begotten by his spirit to a heavenly inheritance and to those persons of good-will who stand in line to become his sons on earth under the Kingdom, and this after such have made a full consecration of themselves to Him to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of necessity this rule of prayer excludes all those who are not sons of God. The petitioner, after thus addressing Jehovah, acknowledges him as the great eternal God, that his name is sacred and shall be vindicated by his great Vindicator and King Christ Jesus, and that Jehovah the Father is worthy to receive all praise and adoration It shows marked reverence on the part of the petitioner for the great Jehovah. There is nothing about it that would warrant the conclusion that the petitioner may irreverently rush into the presence of the Almighty. How different this from what we often hear, to wit, some persons publicly praying and arrogantly telling God what he should do, as at present published in the news concerning war-torn Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” So continues the prayer. (Matt. 6:10) This expression means that the petitioner expresses himself in full harmony with God’s holy will, that he desires the coming of God’s Theocratic Government, that this kingdom may rule in the earth to the end that the will of God may be done in the earth and in heaven also. The petitioner recognizes the injustice, sickness and sorrow in the earth, and that the kingdom of God is the only relief for this; and thus he expresses his humble, sincere desire to see God’s will operating in the hearts of all men that live instead of that which now controls selfish men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic Government is “the kingdom of heaven” because it is the government of Jehovah God operated from heaven by his duly appointed representative, Christ Jesus the King. The Great Theocrat is Jehovah God, the Almighty One. The Theocracy is His government, which shall rule the world in righteousness to the praise and honor of Jehovah’s name and which shall fully vindicate his name before all creation. The King of that great Theocracy, or the one ruling directly under the command of the great Theocrat, is Christ Jesus. For his own name’s sake Jehovah God sent Jesus to earth. At the time of his baptism in the Jordan river Jesus was anointed as King by Jehovah. (See Matthew 3:13-17.) Then Jesus began his work of bearing witness to his Father’s name. His very first discourse, and each one thereafter, magnified Jehovah’s name. The first time he preached, following his anointing, he said: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4:17) That was literally true for the reason that Jesus, the King, was then and there present speaking to those who heard him. For more than three years thereafter Jesus went about amongst the people, visiting them from house to house in the towns and villages, telling them the truth concerning his Father, Jehovah God, and of his kingdom. At all times he emphasized the paramount importance of the Kingdom, which is The Theocracy, and he specifically commanded his followers to always pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.”—Luke 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not an uncommon thing to hear religious clergymen say that the present kingdoms of this earth are here by divine right and that therefore they represent God. This is directly contrary to what Jesus said. When he stood before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, he declared: “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36) The reason why he then said this was that for a long period of time Satan had been the “god of this world”. So Jesus taught his disciples to keep their hearts in harmony with him, and to patiently wait and pray for the coming time when the kingdom of God should be established and when the will of God should be done here. It expresses a hope that in God’s due time his kingdom will be established for the benefit of obedient mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The presumption is that the one who prays as above seeks to ascertain the will of God by studying his Word, and that from the Word of God he sees that in God’s due time Christ Jesus shall take charge of the affairs in earth, that he will bind Satan that he may deceive the nations no more, and that the Kingdom will establish peace and righteousness amongst men that they may be brought back into harmony with him. This has really been the desire of the true and faithful Christian throughout the age. He has properly not been praying to God to convert the world, because he knows from the Word of God that the religious systems will not get the world converted, but that “in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof”. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) Hence the Christian has been praying that God’s will and purpose to vindicate His name by his kingdom should be carried out, and he has known from God’s Word that His purpose is to establish his kingdom amongst men. For this reason the true Christian is zealous in telling other people about that Theocratic Government, that they may have a hope of relief from present sufferings and learn about the blessings that will come through the ministration of that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Authorized Version, or King James Version, of Matthew 6:10 reads: “Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.” If by the word “heaven”, as here used, is meant the council of Jehovah, then, of course, God’s will has always been done in his court. But the word “heaven” cannot invariably be limited to the throne of Jehovah. There has been rebellion in the invisible as well as in the visible realm. When the time came to put the rebellious ones out, at the time Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world ended, in A.D. 1914, then God sent forth the rod of power out of his capital organization Zion, with the order and authority to Christ Jesus the King to “rule ... in the midst of thine enemies”. (Ps. 110:2) Whichever construction we may place upon the words of the Master in the prayer he taught, it does not at all militate against the fact that Satan was in heaven and has now been expelled from heaven; or that this expulsion took place in or immediately after 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As expressed at 2 Corinthians 4:3,4, Satan has for centuries been the “god of this world”, and his world is composed of the evil heavens and the evil earth, to wit, the invisible and the visible part. At 2 Peter 3:13 the apostle says: “Nevertheless we, according to his [God’s] promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” It follows then that the old heaven is the Devil’s and is therefore evil, wicked. Revelation 12:1-12 shows that the Devil has now been cast out of heaven. The Lord Jesus has assumed his power and reigns. The next act is to expel Satan and his demons and his visible representatives from the earth; and then there will be a new heaven and earth. In it the Lord will establish righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prayer continues: “Give us this day our daily bread.” (Matt. 6:11) This means both literal food and the things upon which it is necessary to feed the mind. The creature that has devoted himself to God by a consecration to do His will consists of mind, will, heart and physical organism. The organism is flesh and blood, like that of other men. This organism requires daily food for sustenance. It is entirely proper that the son should request these things of the Father, because it is the will of God that his children should ask and receive that which is for their good. The Christian properly does not ask that he be given houses and lands and factories and great quantities of money; but he asks his Father to provide his daily needs, and he asks in confidence, because Jehovah God has promised that his little ones shall not suffer for the things that are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is therefore entirely proper for the child to daily ask his heavenly Father to provide for him food and raiment that may be necessary, to the end that he may serve the Lord. This, of course, implies that he will be thankful for what he does receive, and he will delight each day to express his thanksgiving both by word and by action, at meals and otherwise. The child of God grows as he feeds his mind upon the precious things of the divine purpose. He has a command from the Lord to be not conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. (Rom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">12: 2) This means that the child of God will study the Bible, God’s Word; and as he studies he will ask the heavenly Father to feed him upon the precious things thereof that in due time he may have a vision or a clearer understanding of His great truths. In this behalf, to aid all persons of good-will in their fight against the iniquity of today, an appropriate Scripture text is selected from the Bible for each and every day of the year and in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> are published appropriate and consistent comments on each daily text. By considering the text and comments at the beginning of each day the consecrated ones are aided to meet the perplexing problems that daily arise and thereby they are fed spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every true child of God has experienced this blessed privilege. As he studies the Lord’s Word, confidently trusting in him, the Lord leads him into wider fields of understanding and fulfills to him his precious promise (Prov. 4:18): “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” The Lord Jesus said concerning the creature that lives: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.” (Luke 4:4) The Christian, therefore, properly will be asking for the things needful for his development as a Christian in harmony with God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus then proceeds in the model prayer thus: ‘And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.’ (Matt. 6:12) This is a searching test for the Christian. If someone has done him an injury and he feels resentment and refuses to forgive such a one who repents, he cannot conscientiously approach Jehovah God in prayer and ask to be forgiven. This teaches the Christian to be merciful and kind and to look upon the afflictions of his fellow creatures with sympathy and to be willing to forgive whenever forgiveness is asked. If we are not willing to thus forgive we cannot expect our Lord to forgive us. We have to come to the Lord frequently for forgiveness, acknowledging our shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Peter asked Jesus how often he should forgive an offender. In Matthew 18: 21, 22 it is written: “Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.” This really means that we should never refuse to forgive an offender where that offender asks for forgiveness. Our Lord and Master stands as the Advocate of the Christian; and while this is no warrant for a Christian to do a wrong, if he does commit a wrong he has the privilege of going to God in prayer and asking help. (1 John 2:1, 2) He should cultivate the disposition of doing the same toward his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prayer continues: “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” The King James Version does not here give a clear rendering, for God does not lead anyone into temptation. (Jas. 1:13) Rotherham’s emphatic translation reads: “And bring us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.” The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> Version reads: “And abandon us not to trial, but preserve us from evil.” The American Revised Version reads: “But deliver us from the evil one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is observed that when the Lord Jesus had made a consecration to do God’s will and symbolized that consecration by water baptism and thereafter spent forty days in the wilderness, then the Devil was permitted to tempt him. (Luke 4:1-4) He was therefore put to a test as to whether or not he would prove his loyalty and faithfulness to God under the test. He withstood the test and proved his faithfulness and maintained his integrity toward Jehovah God. In 1 Peter 2:21 the apostle tells us: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” In corroboration of this the apostle Paul declares: “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” (Heb. 12:6,7) Chastisement here means disciplining or test. The test must come to each one that he may have the opportunity to prove his faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning those who are faithful and maintain their integrity under the test it is written, at James 1:12: “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.” God does not tempt any man, but he permits the test to be put before man; and the Christian is to pray that the Lord God will not abandon him in that test, but that he will sustain him; and he may have faith and confidence that the Lord God will deliver him. This is really a time of temptation. Concerning the Christian’s privilege in time of temptation the apostle writes: “Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”—Heb. 4:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The further words of Matthew 6:13 found in the King James Version, to wit, “For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever,” are still repeated in public and private religious functions; but these words are not found in the older manuscripts of the Bible text and hence do not appear in the modern revised versions. Those words are an interpolation; and evidently this interpolation was made at the instigation of Satan to aid his emissaries to foist upon the people the thought that the kingdoms of this earth belong to God. It is inconsistent with the first part of the prayer: “Thy kingdom come.” However, the time has come when the Lord has assumed his power and begun his reign. Still it is proper for the Christian to continue praying “Thy kingdom come” until Satan is ousted completely and God’s will is done in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus appreciated the privilege and value of prayer. The record in the Scriptures tells of his repeatedly going into a secret place to pray, and sometimes all night. His disciples saw the importance of praying aright, and asked him to teach them to pray. He did teach them, and the instruction which he gave them applies with equal force to all his followers. The Christian should daily keep near the Lord, that the way of communication by prayer may always be open between him and his Father, through the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Christians’ Head, Redeemer and King.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IS RELIGION HOLY?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">N CERTAIN circles in “Christendom” the expressions are often publicly made, such as “our holy religion”, “his holiness,” “the holy father,” and the like. At the same time the laws of the nations of “Christendom” provide severe punishment for those who are guilty of lewd, unchaste, indecent conversation or conduct in the presence of others or with one another, and for acts that result in injury to another; and there are millions of people who diligently strive to live up to the accepted moral standard. They are kind and considerate with others; they are chaste in their relationship to the opposite sex; they observe the laws of the land; they diligently shun evil and try to do good, and are therefore such as are generally called “nature’s noblemen”. Many believe that such a course of conduct guarantees for them eternal happiness in heaven. However, many of the world who make no pretense of being Christians may come nearer to keeping this standard than do some who profess to be consecrated Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If every one kept that standard perfectly it would not constitute holiness unto the Lord, within the meaning of the Holy Scriptures. Those who have weighed the matter carefully realize it is practically impossible for a man to be perfect in thought, word and deed; and for this reason many have been deterred from attempting to be Christians; and many Christians, having a misunderstanding of the matter due to religion, have become discouraged. Some will say, however that what the Lord requires of a man is that he must be perfect in intention. To this the answer must be that many upright, noble people of the world habitually intend to do right and not to do wrong Something more than merely a good intent is required by the One who says: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.”—1 Peter 1:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Holiness is required of those who shall see the Lord. The admonition at Hebrews 12:14 is: “Follow . . . holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.” Holiness, within the meaning of the Scriptures, means an unreserved consecration, absolute dedication and continued unselfish devotion of oneself to God. It means to be set apart to the worship and service of God. It means to be completely reserved from profane or common use. Holiness means to be whole, unimpaired and sound from every wrongful affection. It means an unselfish zeal toward God as His true and faithful servant. The opposite of the term “holy” is “impure; fractional; divided or impaired”. When we speak of “the whole solar system” we mean the entire, complete solar system, not a part of it. Likewise, “holiness unto the Lord” means to be wholly, completely and absolutely devoted to the Lord God, in the faithful performance of duty and of obligation such as are laid upon the one who becomes holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is religion holy? Is it not true that during the greater portion of the so-called “Christian era” the most of those who professed to be Christians but who were in fact religionists have thought it entirely proper and in fact a religious duty for them to participate in politics; to seek office and hold office in the various branches of the worldly governments; and to participate in temperance organizations, and to promote like reforms of the world? Is it not also true that almost all such professed Christians have honestly believed that what is required of them in order to be holy</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">is for them to be morally pure, chaste, virtuous, honest; not to rob, steal or commit other crimes; and at the same time to grow patient, kind, pious and read religious literature, or even the Bible ? Is it not true that this is what many have called “character development”, and have not many of them believed they could perfect a “character” while in the flesh ? And have not many others, having such a religious conception of holiness, become discouraged because they could not reach the perfect standard ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the great deceiver, Satan, has deceived many, causing some to be exalted in mind and to assume an attitude of being “holier than thou” (Isa. 65:5), while others have fallen away because of discouragement. Thus the adversary has turned the faces of these away from the perfect pattern and caused them to look to themselves, some going to one extreme and some to another extreme. The difficulty all along has been that they did not understand their duty and obligation unto God, nor the necessity of keeping away from all entanglements laid for them by the adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is holy because all his ways are right. (Ps. 18: 30) The Lord Jesus is holy because he has always been in harmony with Jehovah God, and his ways have therefore always been right. Everything that is out of harmony with God is unholy. Satan and his organization made up of religion, commerce and politics are not only out of harmony with God but in opposition to God; therefore they are unholy. There can be no partnership or fellowship between holiness and unholiness. Jesus plainly said: “No [man] can serve two masters.” (Luke 16:13) No one can devote part of himself to God and the remainder to Satan’s organization. The Christian can have no sympathy with the Devil’s organization, or any part thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cardinal Gibbons, in his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers, </span><span class="font5">page 38, writes: “In the Creed framed in the first Ecumenical Council of Nicaea, in the year 325, we find these words: T believe in the One, Holy, Catholic and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Apostolic </span><span class="font5">Church.’ ” Credulous persons have been induced to believe that the Roman Catholic organization is the Church of God, and for that reason they have submitted themselves to the organization which is ruled by the Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The office and mission of the true church of God under Christ Jesus, compared with that of the Roman Catholic organization, show that the two take exactly opposite courses. The Roman Catholic organization is now and for centuries has been engaged in religion, politics and commerce for gain, and is therefore unholy and the enemy of God and of all men. In the Scriptures a “tree” is used as a symbol of a creature or of an organization composed of creatures, and the fruits of that tree symbolically stand for what such creature or organization holds before the people as spiritual food for their sustenance and growth. Speaking of the same, at Matthew 7:18-23, Jesus said: “A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. . . . Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s kingdom shall in time rule in righteousness and minister blessings to faithful people. The kingdom of God </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">269</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">has nothing that is commercial, and has nothing in common with the harsh, cruel and wicked system that rules the world now and which present rule is under the Devil and his representatives. Concerning this world Jesus said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” “The prince of this world [Satan] cometh, and hath nothing in me.”—John 18:36; 14:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the religionists of his time that claimed to be holy but opposed the Kingdom message Jesus addressed himself, and to them and also to religionists of the present time he says: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21:43) Never at any time has the Roman Catholic church organization brought to the people the fruit or message of God’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, but, on the contrary, that organization has at all times co-operated with politicians, militarists, commercial giants, and other gangsters to rule and control the nations of the earth. Instead of bearing before the people the fruits of God’s written Word, which sustain the spiritually hungry ones, the Catholic organization has bitterly opposed the Kingdom or Theocracy under Christ. Every religious organization on the earth indulges in politics and in commerce, more or less, and contrary to God’s will, and all these organizations ill-treat and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses who bear the message or fruits of and concerning The Theocracy or kingdom of God before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one becomes a Christian he may think for a time that it is right and proper for him to participate in and pursue a course similar to that of the so-called “respectable” part of the world. But he cannot do this and be holy. He must leave the religion, the politics, the reformations, the temperance organizations and every similar thing and become absolutely and completely dedicated to the Lord, and use his faculties with which he is endowed to the Lord’s glory and the advancement of the interests of His Theocratic Government. In no other way can he become holy. The apostle Paul confirms this when he says: “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”—Rom. 12: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil has led some to believe that sanctimoniousness is holiness or saintliness. It is really a hypocritical devoutness. A hypocrite may look pious and speak piously, be quiet and submissive in the presence of others, and be regarded by them as very saintly; but he does not deceive the Lord. What is really required of us is, as far as possible, to live up to the highest standard of purity and righteousness and also to be dedicated to the Lord, absolutely and completely using our faculties to the Lord’s glory and refusing to make any compromise with the world, the Devil’s organization. The true sentiment of the Christian’s heart is thus expressed: “For thou art great, and doest wondrous things; thou art God alone. Teach me thy way, 0 Lord ; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.” “Lead me in the way everlasting.”—Pss. 86:10,11; 139: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He who thus earnestly prays will diligently seek to know the Lord’s way and will refuse to conform </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font5">elf to the way of the Devil’s organization. The way of the world at its best is a false way. Its good things the Christians desired before they became God’s children. Now they must have no sympathy therewith. As stated at Psalm 119:104: “Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.” To walk in the right way the affections of a Christian cannot be divided between the Lord’s organization and something that is included in the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation.” (1 Pet. 1:15) To become holy the Christian must set his affections on things above and not on things in the earth or Satan’s visible organization on earth. (Col. 3:2) To be holy the child of God must be “conformed to the image” of God’s holy Son, Christ Jesus. (Rom. 8:29) The word “image” here means likeness or resemblance. The Lord Jesus withstood the temptations of Satan and remained firm and steadfast in his devotion to God. (Matt. 4:1-11) The world is the Devil’s organization. The Christian is in the world. Jesus overcame the world by being faithful to his Father. He said to his followers: “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”—John 16: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the text “Be ye holy in all manner of conversation” the word “conversation” means course of action or conduct. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> translation) Our course of action or conduct, therefore, must be in harmony with God’s organization and contrary to the Devil’s organization. Thus the Christian must grow up into Christ in all things.-Eph. 4:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostles were holy, because they were absolutely and completely devoted to God. The apostle Paul declared he was determined to know nothing except Jesus Christ, and him crucified for maintaining his integrity toward God in vindication of His name. (1 Cor. 2: 2) Again Paul said: “Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 3:13,14) When he was known as Saul of Tarsus he was a man of affairs in the world, but when he became Paul the Christian he desired them no more. The same was true with the apostle Peter and with all others that have followed in the footsteps of Jesus and have proved faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Ephesians 2:19-22 the apostle says: “Ye . . . are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.” This growing up into Christ Jesus means that we must be wholly dedicated and devoted to God and his righteous cause. The Lord God is building a habitation for himself, which is his capital organization Zion, and those of Zion can have no sympathy or fellowship with the Devil’s organization. Is it not apparent, then, that to be holy means to be unreservedly on God’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At 2 Corinthians 7:1 the apostle further says: “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&quot;</span><span class="font5"> The adversary has deceived many into believing that all that is required by this text is to clean up oneself from filthy habits of the flesh and filthy thoughts and words. That must be done, of course; yet the “noble” people of the world clean themselves up from filthiness of the flesh, filthiness of the mind and filthiness of speech and conduct. Note therefore that the apostle goes farther and says: “Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” This means an absolute and complete separation of oneself from everything that has to do with the Devil’s organization, and to be completely and absolutely devoted to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must be “in the world”, of course; but we must be fearless and faithful witnesses of Jehovah God while in the world. We must be completely and unreservedly devoted to God, and the inducing cause for so being must be our love for God. About this there can be no doubt; because at Ephesians 1: 4 it is written: “According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in love.&quot;</span><span class="font5"> This does not mean merely perfection in intention. A man may deceive himself by saying, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> intend to be faithful to the Lord, I intend to be a true Christian,” and yet hide his light under a bushel or speak softly concerning the Devil’s organization for fear he might offend someone; and thus fail or refuse to be a true witness for the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a child of God loves his Father he will keep God’s commandments and keep them joyfully. That rule is stated at 1 John 5: 3. No one can keep the commandments of God at this time without engaging in the service as a witness for Jehovah. The Watch Tower has been severely criticized by some for urging active service upon those who have entered into a covenant with God to do His will. It is apparent that such criticism comes either from those who are “holier than thou” or from religionists who have sympathy with the Devil’s organization. The Watch Tower stresses service because of its great importance to the Christian at this time. One of Jehovah’s commandments to his children is: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord [Jehovah], that I am God.” (Isa. 43:12) There are no other witnesses for Jehovah God on earth than those in a covenant with Him to serve him. God expects those who are consecrated to him to dedicate themselves to his service and to serve joyfully. It is the solemn duty of every Christian to point out these things to his brethren.—Rom. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In corroboration of the foregoing, the apostle J ude says: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the holy [spirit], keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.” (Jude 20, 21) Our “most holy faith” is complete confidence in the divine purpose of Jehovah to vindicate his name by means of his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and to deliver and bless faithful humankind. We know from physical facts and Scripture that that kingdom is at hand and that the Devil’s time is short until he is destroyed at the battle of Armageddon and that he is striving to destroy the remnant of the Seed of God’s promise and their faithful earthly companions, and that our only safety from his wiles or demonism is to abide in or under Jehovah’s capital organization and keep His commandments. (Rev. 12:12,17) Only those who love the Lord God and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">prove</span><span class="font5"> their love for him by maintaining their integrity toward Him are holy in his sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Hebrews, the eleventh chapter, a long list of faithful men of old is given. It includes the holy prophets, which “holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy [spirit]”. (2 Pet. 1:21) These men were counted holy by the Lord, not because they were perfect in the flesh, not because they had “developed a character”, but because of their unswerving and absolute devotion to God. These are set forth as examples to the Christian today. “Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” (Jas. 5:10,11) The Bible records stern truths about these men and women; and, judged by the false standard that the Devil holds up by his representatives, they could never be counted holy. Amongst these was David. Although he had weaknesses, yet God calls him “a man after mine own heart”. And why? Because there never was any question about David’s devotion to God.—Acts 13: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s course is one of steadfastness in righteousness, and always was and always will be. Remember that the apostle says that ‘without holiness no man can see God’. The holy ones, those who shall see God, will be those who love him and who are faithful to his Theocratic cause “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserveth the faithful.” (Ps. 31:23) That rule applies today both to the faithful remnant and to their faithful earthly companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time God has furnished such faithful ones with a clearer vision of the adversary’s organization than ever before, and He shows us our privilege of being on His side, the side of The Theocratic Government. If at one time the Christian in ignorance desired certain things of the Devil’s organization which appeared to be good, such things as religion or demonism, no longer shall these be desired. Now will every child of God be holy even as Jehovah God is holy. Such one will be counted holy if prompted by love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness. All such devote themselves faithfully and earnestly to the cause of Jehovah God as his true and faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Holiness is not merely a standard which the mind can reach up to and endorse, but it must be attained. Absolute holiness, within the meaning of the Scriptures, must be attained by the overcoming Christian on this side of Armageddon if he would be preserved by the Lord from destruction during that decisive battle between God’s organization and the Devil’s organization. Holiness means that the Christian must be pure in his thoughts, words and actions, so far as that is possible with his imperfect organism; but it means much more than this. It means a complete and absolute devotion to God’s cause and Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and this prompted by love. It means the faithful performance of the Christian’s covenant as a witness for Jehovah. A Christian can now, before Armageddon, refuse to sympathize with or support in any way the Devil’s organization which shall be completely destroyed at Armageddon. The Christian can devote every faculty that he has to the support of and to the witness for God’s organization. Thus doing, he will attain to the standard of holiness. Continuing in this attitude and holding fast his integrity faithfully unto the end, he shall have a part in the vindication of the holy name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GLIMPSES OF UNOCCUPIED FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Last week we had a wonderful evening here with a pioneer publisher from France, telling us of the marvelous protection the Lord gave his children on different occasions. Persons of good-will are coming out there more than before. Said pioneer living in Lyon, unoccupied France, had been charged with having organized meetings; which was not true. He had just </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">visited</span><span class="font5"> some friends, but unfortunately these friends were arrested and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">forced</span><span class="font5"> to admit that he had conducted a meeting; which was not the case. Five signed a document to this effect; one refused and was beaten. When his trial came he defended himself with the Bible. First the Attorney General was furious and much against him. Then the pioneer said: ‘First I was charged with being under German influence. Today I am charged with being under English influence. Tomorrow you may accuse me of something else; and just now you charged me with being a prophet!’ Then he gave a fine witness for Jehovah and His kingdom. The Attorney General was quite changed then and said he did not want to start a religious persecution of this man. The pronouncing of the judgment was delayed eight days, and when it came out </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he was acquitted</span><span class="font5"> and the judge reproached the five friends very hard for having signed a document only because of being forced, and said that they must be punished for that—for giving in! (How like Jeremiah and Urijah!—Jeremiah 26:20-24) They were sentenced at 50 francs each. Another who had not signed was acquitted as well. Isn’t this like an indication from the Lord that we must do right? There are many other fine things which, of course, cannot all be written, but a careful watcher sees how bountifully Jehovah rewards in each and every case the full faith of his children. Over there, of course, freedom is gone completely, together with many of the commodities of life; potatoes are missing, and when once in a while they can get a kilo for a family they have to pay 40 francs for it. Everything is rationed (as is the case with almost all of the more valuable things here in Switzerland) ; you certainly know this from the journals. But until now we are cared for properly and especially with the farms we have. We got on fine!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN RELIGION-HIDDEN LOUIHIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Kingdom publisher, witnessing to a venerable old Frenchman, a lifelong Catholic: ‘What do you think of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and other Kingdom literature?’ Frenchman : ‘Ah! you witnesses for God make the Catholic church do something it never do before, give the Bible to the people.’ During street-witnessing at Franklinton, placing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> on ‘Hitler’s Religion’, a man took a copy of the magazine and eyed the publisher grimly and suspiciously : ‘What is your name and address?’ Straight to the courthouse he went with the magazine. Back he came in fifteen minutes and said to the publisher: ‘Let’s go get a Coca Cola.’ Time being up for street work, the publisher gladly accepted the offer for cooling refreshment. Said the man: T am the commander of the American Legion here. We carefully investigate everything bearing Hitler’s name. Your work is fine. Keep it up. Put out plenty of that here. I fought with the American army in the World War, trained with the British army four years, and we are determined that nothing of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitlerism shall get ahold in this area. Good-bye, and best luck to you in your work.’ This bears out the statement by Judge Rutherford in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovers Fifth Column</span><span class="font5"> that there is an element in the American Legion that is sincere and whose intentions are to preserve liberty in this land. The Catholic Hierarchy has not put its collar on every Legionnaire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM PIONEER HOME NO. S, LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Last Friday night our little boy had been put to bed at the usual time and was fast asleep when the raid started. As there appeared to be no immediate danger, we left him there; but suddenly the thought struck us that it would be wise to take precaution and bring him down to the living room. We had thus acted only but a very short time when a shower of incendiaries came down. On running upstairs, to our surprise we found one was fiercely burning at the foot of the boy’s bed, which quickly set the latter on fire The bed was eventually thrown through the window and the bomb extinguished. His life was thereby saved. It surely was a miracle! The adjoining room was also penetrated by two incendiaries; these also were quickly brought under control. All together, total damage sustained is about £8. All around us, for six consecutive nights, hundreds of bombs of the largest caliber and land mines have descended on their deadly mission, bringing terror and destruction to thousands of people and wiping out at least half of the homes of the people in our Unit’s territory, together with the major portion of the business and industrial premises. The sights here are too ghastly and terrible to adequately describe. Within 70 to 100 yards of this pioneer home many houses have been smashed and many killed. It has been a most nerve-racking experience, but, by the Lord’s grace, we have held up our heads with a smile of confidence in the power and care of our God, whose mighty power can well thwart the combined demoniacal onslaught that would ordinarily frighten the hardest of humans. Although up until 4: 30 a.m. and 5 a.m., yet after a few hours of sleep we have risen, eaten and proceeded with the Theocratic witness, and many are the joyful and interesting experiences we have had during these terrible days. We have prepared ourselves for the worst, fully believing that whatever happens to our dwellings and earthly possessions, if we have taken proper steps to safeguard such, the Lord has his wise reasons lor allowing certain things to happen to his own people. We are determined, by His grace, to press on with all our might in the ‘strange work’ despite the many difficulties confronting us just now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC DETERMINATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The following Resolution was passed by the Southend (England) company of Jehovah’s witnesses this evening. At their request I have the privilege to forward it to you. ‘This company wishes to register its appreciation of the Society’s most encouraging letter of April 22 last and its unanimous resolve to individually and unitedly endeavor to serve Jehovah with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">greater zeal</span><span class="font5"> and activity in bold and sustained obedience to all organization instructions, until forcibly compelled to desist, fearless of all enemies, visible and invisible, by Jehovah’s gracious aid.’ The fervency with which the Resolution was put and carried persuades that it will be perseveringly fulfilled.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act Is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&quot;—Heb. 12:6.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">or refuses to carry out his covenant has, within the language of the Scriptures, “sworn deceitfully.” (Ps. 24:3,4) Religious teachers or preachers have induced many to conclude that the only thing required of them is to say, “I believe on the Lord,” and that because of such declaration such person at death goes straight to heaven. The Scriptures flatly contradict that conclusion. David, who pictures Christ Jesus and his faithful followers, expressed the correct conclusion in these words: “Examine me, 0 Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth.”—Ps. 26: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* Persons who have for years been serving Jehovah and Christ Jesus are still subjected to severe trials; and some wonder why. The answer is that all who receive Jehovah’s approval must prove their steadfastness for The Theocracy. One can prove this only by being put to the test and under that test remaining immovable and continuing steadfast for Jehovah and His King. Even now, when the King of The Theocracy is upon his throne, his servants on earth find themselves beset by many trials; but to the faithful such trials are not at all surprising. Those who are wholly devoted to The Theocracy and who see the great fight being made by the enemy against The Theocratic Government can appreciate why the individuals in God’s organization on earth are put to the test. As Job was put to the severe test and continued to hold fast his integrity, so now one who will receive the reward of Jehovah’s approval must be put to the test and prove himself entirely blameless before God.—Job 2:3-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Say the Scriptures: ‘Tor whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives.” (Heb. 12:6, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott')</span><span class="font7"> All the demons are fighting against Jehovah’s covenant people, and God permits his covenant people to have such chastisement that they may, under severe trials, prove their lasting preference for and devotion to the great Theocrat and His King. The man who is in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will, and who hopes to receive Jehovah’s approval, must have and exercise un-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">323</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">TEHOVAH’S manner of dealing with his creatures I is for their good. It is therefore written of him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font7"> “God is love” (1 John 4: 8); meaning that Jehovah is entirely unselfish. Jehovah needs nothing from his creatures, because all things in heaven and earth are his. Religious preachers have grossly misrepresented Jehovah, and in doing so they have, no doubt, been blinded by the adversary; which blindness has resulted from their fear of men and failure to fear and serve Jehovah God. Such preachers tell the people words to this effect: “God is standing with outstretched hands begging men to come and be saved; therefore won’t you come today?” Such a statement is entirely false and is a defamation of Jehovah God’s holy name and is entirely contradicted by his Word. Jehovah places the truth before his creatures and permits them to voluntarily accept the same and willingly serve Him or to reject His Word and suffer the consequences. Jehovah neither begs nor compels anyone to serve him. Note the scriptures that flatly contradict the words of religious preachers; to wit: “But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”—Heb. 11: 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> One cannot approach God unless he first has faith, that is, believes that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that the creature receives His blessings only when he seeks those blessings. He rewards only those who diligently seek to know and to do his will. God is no respecter of persons. (1 Pet. 1:17) He is making no effort to induce anyone to get into his organization and serve him. All who desire to know and to serve God must do so voluntarily, and not by compulsion or undue influence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> When the creature man exercises faith in God and in Christ Jesus as his Redeemer and then voluntarily consecrates himself to do God’s will, agreeing that he will be guided by God’s Word, then the situation changes as to him. Having entered into a covenant to do the will of God, then he must perform his covenant and be obedient to the Most High. One who agrees to do the will of God and then willingly fails</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">feigned faith and full confidence in God and in Christ, fully determining to remain steadfast for the great Theocratic Government, regardless of what trials may come to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> Say the Scriptures concerning those who serve God and are beset by trying experiences: “Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, 0 Lord, and teachest him out of thy law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.”—Ps. 94:12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> This shows that the trials upon God’s people must continue until the wicked go down into the pit. “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation [trials]; for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.” (Jas. 1:12) Since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple Satan and his agents have desperately assaulted the servants of Jehovah and Christ. (Rev. 12:17) This the Lord could have prevented, but he has permitted it for a purpose, and one purpose is that the covenant people of Almighty God may prove their unbending devotion to The Theocracy by Christ Jesus and, holding fast their integrity to the end, may receive God’s approval. With this introduction to the subject matter, again we take up the consideration of Daniel’s prophecy as that prophecy is related to Jehovah’s covenant people at the present time on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’ “And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.” (Dan. 11: 35) By other translators this text is rendered thus: ‘And some of them that are wise do stumble.’ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{Revised Version</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Young’s) </span><span class="font7">In the preceding verse, thirty-four, considered in a previous issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> it is seen that the demons try flattering schemes against Jehovah’s servants to turn them away from the proper course. These flatterers are lying, unfaithful, like the counselor of David described at 2 Samuel 15: 30-34. Some have yielded to such flatteries and have stumbled and fallen. Some have stumbled, but recovered; while others fall completely and are not recovered. One’s recovery from stumbling is possible only when that one is put to the test and realizes that he has taken the wrong course and then quickly repents and diligently seeks the face of the Lord for forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ It was in 1938 that the Lord revealed to his people that his organization is The Theocracy and that it is ruled from the Head downward, and not from the bottom upward. Everyone who receives God’s approval must come to an appreciation of this fact. The question of paramount importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Some fail to see that allimportant truth, but, on the contrary, they consider themselves and their individual ease and salvation of great importance. Such persons fall, and for them there is no recovery. The rebellion against the rule of The Theocracy is disastrous. Those who rebel insist on their own selfish course. They forsake the course of wisdom and understanding and follow a selfish course evidently because they have yielded to flatteries put upon them by the demons invisible and by their visible representatives. Any man who indulges in flattery shows a lack of faith and of appreciation of God’s Word and his dealing with men.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>10</sup> The “fall” of such as forsake wisdom and understanding is not the end of the matter, but after their fall they continue in a wrongful course by trying to induce others to follow the same course of opposition to the Theocratic organization, and thus they pull others down with them. Such falling ones endeavor to turn others away from faithful service to The Theocracy; but those who receive Jehovah’s approval are not turned away. Such fallen ones become entirely blind to the paramount question of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and they meditate day and night as to how they may interfere with the progress of the proclamation of the Theocratic message: “For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.”—Prov. 4:16,19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>w</sup>Why has the Lord permitted the fallen ones to try to pull others down with them and to turn them away from the Theocratic organization and Government ! The Scriptures answer: “To try them”; (</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.) </span><span class="font7">“to refine them&quot;. At the temple judgment the Lord permits such things to come to pass to make manifest who is immovable and who is steadfast for The Theocracy. “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3: 3) “And I will bring the third part [the remnant] through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on my name, and I will hear them; I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God.”—Zech. 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” Concerning this very same matter Jehovah by his angel further said to Daniel: “And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly ; and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&quot;—Dan. 12: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">** The fiery trials that come upon Jehovah’s people have the effect of purging and cleansing the visible part of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and those who are associated with it, even as Achan was cleared out to remove the wicked leaven of poison from the typical Theocratic organization. (Josh. 7:10-26) Such cleansing or purging work continues. Even in the organization today there are some that murmur and complain, and the earth swallows them up. (Num. 16: 30-34) By “the earth” is meant the visible organization of which Satan is now in control. And how long shall such purging work continue!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>14</sup> “Even to the time of the end.” That means until the “strange work” of the Lord is completed and his “strange act” is made manifest at Armageddon. “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.” (1 Cor. 10:12) This is exactly in harmony with the words of Christ Jesus the King concerning those who have become unfaithful at the time of the end of the world: “As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.&quot; —Matt. 13:40-43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>15</sup> When the faithful servants of Jehovah see the unfaithful cleared out they are drawn even nearer to the Lord and the Lord causes them to shine brightly in his organization and in his service, even as Jesus stated in the foregoing text. At the St. Louis Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions, August, 1941, this point was clearly demonstrated, when those who are walking in the light of The Theocracy, with unanimous declaration of those assembled there, put the stamp of disapproval upon those persons who have been in the organization and who have attempted to cause division amongst God’s people. Those who are devoted to The Theocracy see that they are continually put to the test, and now they are appreciating the reason for such test; and while the Lord permits his faithful servants to continue to have severe tests, all of the faithful ones now appreciate that it is permitted to test their steadfastness or integrity. And why do these tests continue upon the faithful! and how long shall the same continue!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>16</sup> “Because it [the end] is yet for [the] time appointed.” (Dan. 11: 35) Until the final end of Satan’s organization the integrity of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will certainly be put to the test. Jehovah has permitted such for the good of those who are in a covenant to do his will. While Satan and his associate demons have been cast out of heaven and down to the earth, Jehovah permits that wicked horde to remain for a short time in order that the integrity of his faithful may be put to the test and that they may prove their immovable devotion to Him. While this test is in progress the remnant and their companions continue to declare the name of the great Theocrat and his Government to those people on earth who will hear; and such proclamation must continue until the beginning of Armageddon. Jehovah has definitely fixed the time for the beginning of Armageddon, at which time God will show to all his supreme power. While no man yet knows the day nor the hour that Armageddon will begin, “the signs of the times” show that Armageddon is very near; therefore Jehovah bids his faithful servants now on the earth to 'redeem the time’ and to ‘slack not the hand’ in his “strange work”, the witness work. The many thousands of witnesses assembled at St. Louis in August, 1941, returned to their respective places of activity in the field fully determined to carry on to the end, and that without compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. In the meantime, and from now till Armageddon, the Lord’s four angels hold back the four winds until the work of Jehovah’s “sealed” servants is finished.— Rev. 7:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>17</sup> The final “end” is after God’s “strange work” is done, that is, after ‘this gospel of the kingdom is preached to the world as a witness’. (Matt. 24:14) Now the religionists and allies scoff at the name of Jehovah and speak of his witnesses in words of expressed malice; yet it is certain that they shall come to know ere long that Jehovah is exercising his care over his own people and showing his indignation by the execution of his judgment against the wicked. The religious element, which were principally represented by the unfaithful Israelites (foreshadowing the counterpart of such, and what is called “Christendom”), shall soon know that their end has come; and the Lord makes this so plain that there can be no doubt about it, and concerning this it is written in the prophecy of God, to wit: “Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God unto the land of Israel, An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God, An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. An end is come, the end is come; it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land; the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will recompense thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth.&quot;—Ezek. 7:1-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“ Have in mind now that “the king of the north” is that monstrosity, that is, the dictatorial, totalitarian combine, made up of Nazis, Fascists and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and which compose the ‘abomination of wickedness’, with the great “whore”, the Hierarchy, riding upon the back of that beastly combine, which is described and pictured at Revelation 17:1-5 and 15-18. It is now by that combined element called “the new order”, for which “new order” the present pope of Rome did pray and did extol it in his speech on December 24, 1940, and which is by him called “the new League of Nations”, that that combine is completely bent on ruling the world contrary to Jehovah’s will; and that which is called “the new League of Nations”, or “new order”, is the ‘desolating abomination’, which Jehovah will completely destroy at Armageddon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>19</sup> “And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is determined shall be done.&quot; (Dan. 11:36) The prophecy shows that “the king of the north” would be guided by and influenced by the wicked one and that he would study to do that which is wicked, carrying out his own will, however, as he believes, but in fact doing the bidding of Satan the Devil. Mark how all these things that have come to pass in recent months fulfill this part of the prophecy. “The king [that] shall do according to his will,” as the prophecy states, is “the king of the north”; which means not merely Hitler, but “the king” here means all the component parts of the monstrosity; and since this monstrosity is the Devil’s child, it is carrying out the Devil’s purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> The objective of “the king of the north” is to rule the world. Its visible representatives, acting under demon power and influence, are determined to rule the world according to the selfish will of “the king of the north”. To do this that combine must first undo the work of the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, and hence wipe out completely the result of the Treaty of &quot;Westphalia of 1648, which treaty established toleration between Catholics and Protestants and recognized the right of each to practice his own religion within his respective state or province. Such caused Germany to be broken up into many small provinces or states. Mark this, that never has any pope approved that Treaty of Westphalia and never has he acknowledged that the Papacy was or is bound by it. This should be kept in mind when considering that the Papacy is a part of “the king of the north”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>21</sup> The further purpose of the monstrosity is to undo the effect of the French revolution of 1789, which led to the dissolution of the so-called “Holy Roman Empire” in 1806. Can any sane person now doubt that Petain, the puppet dictator of France, is doing the will of the monstrosity and that he is obeying the order of the pope! The liberties of the French people are gone. The “Axis powers” are determined to re-establish the old “Holy Roman Empire” at any cost of human life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“Another purpose of the “Axis powers”, manifestly, is to wipe out the Peace Treaty of Versailles of 1919, and in which treaty the pope was unable to have his will done, and which treaty particularly had to do with the setting up of the German Republic. That treaty caused the territory of “the king of the north” to be cut up and formed into so-called “republics”, such as Germany, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Lithuania, and by which “the king of the north&quot; was greatly weakened. This was particularly pictured in Revelation by the wound of the sixth head of the beast, as set forth in Revelation 13:1-3: “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. . . . And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” That deadly wound was healed by Satan and his agents, and particularly by operations performed by “Catholic Action”, organized and carried on under the direction of Pope Pius XI, which pope backed and supported Italian Fascism and German Nazism, both religiously and financially; and which Hierarchy also caused many rich subjects of the Hierarchy in other countries to furnish large sums of money to put Hitler on the throne of Nazism. The pope then entered into concordats, one with Fascism in 1929, and then with the Nazis in 1933; and also on this latter date, 1933, he declared a “Holy Year” in an effort to drag other nations into the combine. “Catholic Action” in this behalf worked with both totalitarian rulers, but particularly to make Hitler the spearhead of the Hierarchy in the effort to overthrow democracies and to re-establish “the Holy Roman Empire”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ Another purpose of the combine is to carry out the wicked desire of the “Axis powers”, particularly the Catholic organization, in destroying the republics and bringing such countries into the combine. To this end Austria was annexed to Germany in March, 1938; Sudetenland was seized in 1938; Poland was raped and destroyed in 1939; and then followed the overthrow of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, and France. This done, “the king of the north” attempts to form a “new League of Nations” and to bring all the conquered territory into that League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ But the chief and primary purpose of Satan and his earthly agents aforementioned, however, is and has been to completely destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, who proclaim the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. In every country where the totalitarian power, or “king of the north”, is in control the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been suppressed. Also in every country outside of the territory of “the king of the north” where the Roman Catholic Hierarchy exercises great power Jehovah’s witnesses have been cruelly persecuted and a strong effort has been made to completely destroy their activities and to prevent them from declaring the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. This explains why “the king of the north” has taken one country after another, destroyed its material wealth and its many people, and put a ban on the work of Jehovah’s servants. This proves that the Hierarchy is the chief visible agent of the Devil in this wicked work; and as further proof thereof it is only necessary to cite that in many parts of “the king of the south” also the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is banned, and declared illegal. In every nation this has been done at the instance and by the power of the Hierarchy. The, entire movement of Satan’s crowd is carried on to the end that the Hierarchy and their allies may soon be able to say, “Peace and safety”; then will follow Armageddon. Thus it is seen that, in the language of the prophecy, the words “his will” mean not merely the will of Hitler, but that of the combined elements that make up “the king of the north”; and that particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the subtle and wicked instrument of Satan to carry out this work of “the king of the north”. Satan is that subtle foe of The Theocracy, and religion is the most seductive and deceptive means used by men to accomplish Satan’s purpose; and thus he uses the Hierarchy in a more effective way than some other parts of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “And he shall exalt himself.” It is “the king of the north” here mentioned, that exalts himself by overthrowing constitutional monarchies and democracies and republics, and by exercising power over the people arbitrarily. Jehovah God does not exalt “the king of the north”, but Satan, the chief of demons, and his horde of associated demons, under the command of Gog, carry on the exaltation work and furnish the incentive by and through demonized “Catholic Action” and flatter the political Fuehrer and thus help him to exalt himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “And magnify himself above every god.” The word “god” used in this text means “mighty one”, and in this text the reference is not to invisible demons, but it refers to the mighty ones on earth who are the agents and allies of the demons. The Hebrew word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">el,</span><span class="font7"> here rendered “god”, or “mighty one”, applies to earthly creatures as well as to invisible demons ; and this is shown by the following scripture texts, to wit: “Give unto the Lord, 0 ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.” (Ps. 29:1) “God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judg-eth among the gods.” (Ps. 82:1) “For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord! who among the sons of the mighty [ones] can be likened unto the Lord!” (Ps. 89:6) ‘1 have, therefore, delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen, he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.” (Ezek. 31:11) “The strong among the mighty [ones] shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him; they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.”—Ezek. 32: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” The totalitarian combine of “the king of the north” has overthrown the mighty ones of Protestantism ; and the mighty ones of Free Masonry; and the mighty ones of constitutional monarchies; and the mighty ones of democracies; and the mighty ones of political parties that stood in the way of the combine ; and thus the facts show the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy. In addition thereto a new system of jurisprudence has been set up according to the Nazi-Fascist Canon-Law standards, and thus the former mighty ones of the judiciary of those countries in Europe have been overthrown; also all the mighty ones of the armies that do not quickly bow to the dictator, so that the dictator controls the entire military machine, which is made subservient to the Nazi Fuehrer. He has also magnified himself above the commercial mighty ones, and all of these commercial giants have been made to conform to the desire of Nazism, or the Corporate State. Also the labor organizations have been dissolved in favor of the State Labor Front; and also the farmers who till the soil are made to be entirely subservient to the dictator. The totalitarian dictator becomes the entire thing and is exalted above all mighty ones in every part of the government, and to him all such are required to bow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “And shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods.” In this text “God of gods” is translated from the Hebrew </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El elim,</span><span class="font7"> meaning Jehovah the Almighty God; and against the Almighty God this “king of the north” speaks marvelous things. Note the following texts showing that the reference in this text is to Jehovah, against whom “the king of the north” speaks. “Who is like unto thee, 0 Lord, among the gods [(marginal reading) mighty ones]? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?” (Ex. 15:11) “The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, (save us not this day,).”—Josh. 22:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>80</sup> “The king of the north” speaks marvelous things against the Almighty God by taking adverse action against those who are the witnesses of Jehovah God. Also the natural Jews are persecuted by that same combine because they were the typical covenant people of Jehovah, the Almighty God. In the lands outside of the realm of “the king of the north” that “king”, and particularly the religious element thereof, operates by means of the “fifth column” in misrepresenting Jehovah’s witnesses, and they bring great reproach upon the name of Jehovah; and this is done even in the United States, where liberty has long been enjoyed by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>11</sup> “The king of the north,” which here particularly includes the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the head thereof, exalts the political state above Jehovah God by declaring and insisting that “the higher powers” named in the Scriptures at Romans 13:1 are not Jehovah God and Christ Jesus but are the political rulers of the present unrighteous world. The dictatorial combine condemns The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and persecutes in all countries the persons who tell that The Theocratic Government is the only hope of humankind. Within the realm of “the king of the north” one who proclaims the name and the kingdom of Jehovah by Christ Jesus is charged with sedition. Even in countries outside of the realm of “the king of the north” Jehovah’s witnesses, who proclaim The Theocracy, are charged with seditious conspiracy, and in each instance this is done at the bidding of the religious element of “the king of the north”. That “king” boastfully claims that his is the world empire which shall rule the entire earth in defiance of Jehovah and contrary to His prophetic utterances. “The king of the north” sets up a mimic theocracy, placing the present pope of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the position occupied by Christ Jesus, the real King of the real Theocracy. Such mimic theocracy is “the abomination that maketh desolate” named by Daniel, and the Lord shows the purpose of that combine is to turn all persons away from Almighty God and to rule the earth contrary to God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” Hitler, the leader of the Nazis, declares his purpose to re-establish the old “Holy Roman Empire”. Now mark the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which while carrying on within the realm of “the king of the south&quot; attempts to induce the people to believe that the Hierarchy is against the totalitarian rule now exercised by the Nazis and Fascists. This claim by the Hierarchy is made to induce the “Catholic population” residing within the realm of democracies to remain silent and loyal to the Hierarchy. At the same time the pope, on the 24th of December, 1940, publicly uttered a prayer for the so-called “new order” or “new League of Nations”, which is being pushed forward and set up with Hitler as the leader. What organization on the earth has the greatest desire to re-establish the old “Holy Roman Empire”? The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to be sure! And for that purpose “Catholic Action” was organized and has been carried on for several years throughout the earth. The Hierarchy is pursuing a fixed course of its father the Devil to act with fraud and deception, making it to appear in one country that it is on one side, and in another country that it is on the other side; and this is done to deceive and mislead the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ The political elements of “the king of the south” appear to be blind to the hypocrisy and duplicity of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, or else fear to boldly declare against the same as its foe. Whether blind to the truth or fearful, it leads to the same result and is the moving cause which results in mental blindness. It is Satan who blinds the minds of men, as declared by the Lord’s Word. (2 Cor. 4: 3, 4) It is the fear of men that leads men and nations into Satan’s snare. (Prov. 29:25) Thus the organization of “the king of the south” appears to be blind to its real enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>M</sup> As long as the so-called “democracies” oppose, ignore or fail to support The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, just that long the announced purpose of “the king of the south” is certain to fail. There is but one sure way to determine the degree of progress and legitimate end of “the king of the north” and of “the king of the south”, and that sure way is Jehovah’s sure Word of prophecy, now in progress of fulfillment. Bearing upon this particular point, note that the prophecy says concerning “the king of the north”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “And shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished.” Whose indignation? Jehovah’s indignation, which will be expressed at the battle of Armageddon. Manifestly Jehovah has withheld the expression of his indignation to give “the king of the north” full rope to mark himself for destruction. Beginning with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy element, Jehovah’s indignation will be violently expressed at Armageddon in the complete overthrow of “the king of the north”. That will mark the beginning of the great world trouble, which Jesus Christ describes in these words: “Great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24:21) That means the final end of all of Satan’s organization. Give heed to the Word of Almighty God concerning that tribulation, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.” (Isa. 30:27) “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” (Zeph. 3:8) “Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger! his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.” (Nah. 1:6) “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.” (Jer. 10:10) “The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.” —Jer. 50: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” “The king of the north” has had his day in which he had permission to “have indignation against the holy covenant” (Dan. 11:30); and at Armageddon it is his turn to experience the indignation from the side of the Holy Covenant, to wit, the Lord. Is there a fixed time for that indignation to begin! and when T</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” God’s Word answers that he has fixed the definite time. To Daniel his faithful prophet the Lord made known this fact: “And. he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation; for at the time appointed the end shall be.&quot; —Dan. 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” Daniel may be back on the earth at any time now, and he, together with the faithful covenant people of Jehovah, will know what course to take at that time of the beginning of tribulation, because to all such Jehovah says: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.”—Isa. 26:20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>40</sup> “For that that is determined shall be done.” (Dan. 11:36) It is Jehovah’s “strange act”, the expression of his indignation at the battle of Armageddon, that is determined; and nothing can interfere with or prevent it. To all who hear the Word of Jehovah God now this is of great interest, to wit: “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. Now, therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption [a full end; an utter end], even determined upon the whole earth [Satan’s visible organization, and particularly the religious element and all other elements composing ‘the king of the north’].”—Isa. 28: 21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>41</sup> Jehovah will make a final end of all that are opposed to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Says Jehovah: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. 46:11) “I will work, and who shall let [hinder] it!”—Isa. 43:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOLD FAST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>42</sup> Jehovah’s covenant people now on earth are very small in number. They are even so small in number that religionists speak of them with great contempt. If they were religionists they would receive no notice, because of their smallness, and it is certain that they would not then be persecuted. Why, then, is there so much opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the countries of the earth, and why are they so grievously persecuted in all these countries! Are they dangerous to any nation! They are not dangerous, because they have no desire or inclination to do harm to anyone. Are the ruling powers of the nations afraid of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions as to what they might do to overthrow their power! No, not at all; because Jehovah’s witnesses and companions could do them no injury. Surely the armies that destroy thousands of human lives every day have no fear of falling at the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions. Then why are Jehovah’s witnesses hated in all nations and so cruelly ill-treated and persecuted! The answer is plain, and is easy of comprehension. It is because these people, faithful to Almighty God and in obedience to his commandments, announce to the world that The Theocracy is the only hope of humankind; because they declare God’s vengeance against all that oppose The Theocracy. The great question now for determination is world domination. Shall the world continue under the rule of demons, of which Satan is the chief, or shall the world be ruled in righteousness by Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s duly appointed and anointed King! Satan is determined to continue his rule or ruin the earth. He sets up “the king of the north” and “the king of the south&quot;, each vowing their determination to rule the earth, and he causes them to war with each other. By this means Satan hopes to accomplish the following: (1) To turn the attention of all people away from The Theocracy, and (2) to bring about the death of many millions that they might not learn about The Theocracy ; and thus he hopes to defeat Jehovah’s purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>48</sup> Since the sole purpose and work of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions is to announce the name of Jehovah and his Government of Righteousness by Christ Jesus, and this for the benefit of mankind and to the glory of God; and since they are entirely neutral, they hold themselves aloof from the warring nations. Why does the Almighty God permit them to suffer so many indignities at the hands of their enemies? The answer from God’s Word is, in order that each one of his covenant people may now be permitted to prove his full devotion to The Theocratic Government and thus hold fast his integrity. (Heb. 12:6; Job 2: 3) This test must continue to the end. To the remnant the words of Jesus now apply: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”—Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>44</sup> The apostle and faithful witnesses of the Lord Jesus proclaim this prophecy: “And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Rev. 20:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>45</sup> Those words mean that such faithful ones have no human leader, but that they have given up their own head and look only to Christ Jesus as their Head and Leader that they might bear witness to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. They refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, and, regardless of all earthly persecution and opposition, they remain true, steadfast and blameless before the Lord. Such blamelessness consists of their complete devotion to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Their integrity is put to the test, and those who receive the Lord’s approval will hold fast their integrity under that test. They are being disciplined by the Lord, and they are determined to not yield to demon influence, but that they will remain faithful to Jehovah God and his Government of Righteousness, come what may.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“All nations hate Jehovah’s covenant people because that people declare the name and kingdom, The Theocratic Government, of Almighty God. “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.”—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>47</sup> The crucial test, which must persist until Armageddon, is proof that now is the last time. The words of the apostle now apply to the Lord’s faithful servants, to wit: “Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.”—1 John 2:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“ The antichrists, many of which now appear, are all those against The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus the King, and, says the apostle, ‘whereby we know that this is the last time.’ The words of the apostle here clearly mean that the end of Satanic rule has come: “And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>48</sup> It is therefore clearly to be seen that the crucial test is here, and thus Jesus says to those who follow him: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) “Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) “Do all things without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without'rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”—Phil. 2:14,15.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PROPHECY OF THE TRANSFIGURATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">T C2ESAREA PHILIPPI, near the boundary between Palestine and Syria, and in the presence of Peter and the other apostles the anointed King, Christ Jesus, identified himself as “this rock” upon which he would build his church. Later he added, “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds. Verily I say unto you, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” (Matt. 16:18, 27, 28, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Thereafter came the transfiguration vision, the record concerning which is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him.</span><span class="font5"> And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright eloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the eloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only. And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead. And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come? And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things: but I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.”—Matt. 17 :1-13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The transfiguration in the mountain was a prophetic tableau giving testimony to the high office of Jesus and foretelling greater things to come to pass thereafter. That transfiguration being a prophecy, its true meaning and importance would appear to God’s people only in God’s due time to interpret the same and make it plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ecclesiastes 3:1 declares: “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.” Greater light is given to God’s people at the end of Satan’s world and after Christ Jesus is enthroned, as is indicated at 1 Corinthians 10:11. That would appear to be Jehovah’s time to unfold the meaning or interpretation of his prophecy. For many years it has been known that the prophet Moses was a prophetic figure of Christ Jesus, but not until the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, in A.D. 1918, was it known that what Moses wrote applies particularly to the Lord Jesus and his people while he is at the temple for the judgment work. Only in recent years and since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of God has it been known that Christ Jesus is that great Prophet foreshadowed by Moses and to whom all the present-day remnant on earth of his faithful followers must now be especially obedient, and hence every one that is called to the Kingdom and that fails or refuses to obey that Prophet shall be destroyed.— Deut. 18:15-18; Acts 3: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is the meaning of the prophetic transfiguration scene in the mountain ? That which the prophetic transfiguration magnifies as of greatest importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, and this vindication begins particularly to take place at the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus in power and glory. This statement may appear to be dogmatic, and therefore in support of the above conclusion it is important to consider the words of the apostle Peter leading up to his emphatic statement made at 2 Peter 1:20, to wit: “Knowing this first [that is, as of first importance], that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peter is here addressing his Christian brethren, not as a teacher and certainly not as a pope, but as one whom Jehovah God and Christ Jesus had specifically favored and as one who had received certain important information, which he desired to impart to his brethren that they might keep that information in remembrance for their own well-being. Peter declared that he would not be negligent to put them in remembrance of certain things, and then said: “Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remembrance.” (2 Pet. 1:13) He expressed his opinion that shortly his earthly ministry would end, and that while he had opportunity he would stir up his brethren to greater zeal and that they might have in mind these important truths. “And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to excite you by remembrance; knowing that the laying aside of the tabernacle is at hand, even as our Lord Jesus Christ declared to me. Now I will also endeavor always to have you, after my departure, to make mention of these things.” (2 Pet. 1:13-15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> translation) “Make mention” of what things ? Manifestly the things that came to pass at the time of the transfiguration in the mountain, of which things Peter was one of three witnesses. This is made certain by Peter’s next words: “For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.”—2 Pet. 1:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Referring now to Matthew’s account of the transfiguration vision, it is noted that the three apostles were not permitted to tell anything about it until after the resurrection of Jesus Christ took place. As the record at Matthew 17: 9 states: “And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">vision</span><span class="font5"> to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.” The apostles thereafter obeyed the Lord’s commandment. If the matter had been told by any of them before the resurrection of Jesus, and Jesus had confirmed their statements before others, it might have been said that the proof was much stronger and men would be more likely to have full faith in their statement of what occurred in the mountain. Probably some of the consecrated ones had said to Peter at or previous to the time he wrote his second epistle something to this effect: “It is easy for you to tell a tale like that now. Probably you were very much excited at the time and you think you saw that which you did not in fact see.” Peter’s language at 2 Peter 1: 16 is equivalent to an admission that such might have been a cunningly devised fable and that others had suggested that. To offset that very conclusion Peter said to his brethren: ‘We have not followed a cunningly devised fable; we were eyewitnesses to it.’ They were eyewitnesses of a vision that related to the ‘coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in power and glory’. That definitely establishes the fact that the vision was a prophecy relating to the coming of the Lord Jesus in glory and power for judgment at the temple. (See Matthew 25:31.) This would strongly support the conclusion that the understanding of the vision would not be given to God’s people until after the coming of the Lord to the temple for judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the transfiguration Jesus, with three of his faithful followers, was in the mountain, but Jesus is the only really important one that was there. He was the one that appeared with his face shining as the sun and his raiment white as the light. Clearly that would picture Christ Jesus at the time when God placed him on the heavenly throne as the new world’s rightful Ruler and as Jehovah’s mighty Vindicator. Modern facts in fulfillment of Bible prophecy prove that that enthronement of the Lord Jesus took place in A.D. 1914, as stated at Psalm 2:6. Three and one-half years later, corresponding to the three and a half years of his earthly ministry at his first coming, Christ Jesus came to the temple as the great Judge, to wit, in A.D. 1918. Therefore the transfiguration vision pointed forward to the time that God would inaugurate his kingdom with Christ Jesus on the throne and as his mighty Judge and Vindicator. The unfolding and understanding of the prophetic transfiguration vision could not come until the prophecy had begun to have fulfillment; hence God has kept it a secret until his due time for fulfilling the prophecy and making it known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The record of the transfiguration says, at Matthew 17:3: “And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias, talking with him.” Of course, Moses and Elijah were not actually there present, because this was a “vision”, and, too, Moses and Elijah were dead, as the Scriptures testify. But Jesus was actually there. The vision disclosed Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus, and that would clearly indicate in the tableau that those two prophets had done certain things in the past which foreshadowed greater things that Jesus would do. Moses wrote much of the prophecy of God, and Jesus on another occasion said, “Moses . . . wrote of me.” (John 5:46) The appearance of Moses in the vision, talking with Jesus, was equivalent to saying that the law, which Moses delivered to the Israelites, applies specifically to those who are followers of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, to wit, those who are spiritual Israelites. Also, that the covenant of God given to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the hand of Moses shortly before they crossed the Jordan river into Canaan foreshadowed a greater covenant, to wit, the covenant of faithfulness for the Kingdom, which covenant God makes through Christ Jesus with those who are called to the heavenly kingdom. Also that those who will enter into the Kingdom must faithfully perform that covenant of faithfulness, and that when Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, comes to the temple, then every soul of the temple class must be wholly obedient unto Christ Jesus or else be destroyed. This conclusion is dearly supported by the words of Peter, at Acts 3: 22, 23: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” These truths the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses learned and began to appreciate after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple in glory and power in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elijah appeared along with Moses in the transfiguration vision. Elijah delivered certain prophecies and performed certain prophetic work, and in this he foreshadowed Christ Jesus and a work Jesus would do, which work was preparatory to his coming to the temple of God in 1918. That work had particular reference to the restitution or restoration of the great and important doctrines concerning the kingdom of God or Theocratic Government; which truths had been delivered to the Israelites and to the apostles after the coming of Jesus nineteen centuries ago, but which had been lost sight of after the death of the apostles and were hid until the Lord Jesus turned his attention to the things of the earth a short time prior to his coming to the temple in 1918. That this is the correct conclusion is shown by the conversation that took place between Jesus and the three apostles on coming down from the mountain, to wit, “And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.” This conversation was based on the prophecy recorded at Malachi 4: 5, 6 and 3:1-3, which reads: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> : and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> an offering in righteousness.” The prophetic work as foreshadowed by what the prophet Elijah did and said was fulfilled in a miniature way by John the Baptist, who, as the forerunner of Jesus, announced his coming at his first advent. But there is also a larger and complete fulfillment, and the work foreshadowed by Elijah has now been performed in completeness by the Lord Jesus Christ in the years immediately preceding the time of his coming to the temple in A.D. 1918. So, having performed this preparatory work thus prophesied at Malachi 3:1, then he suddenly (or straightway) appeared at the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the prophetic transfiguration vision the appearance of Elijah and Moses had no relationship whatever to the resurrection of the dead, because there is nothing either directly or indirectly said about resurrection. Religionists who have tried to uphold the Devil’s lie that “there is no death” and “the dead are not dead” (Gen. 3:4) have grabbed upon this transfiguration scene as recorded and used it in their attempt to prove that Moses and Elijah were alive at that time; but such have overlooked the fact also that Jesus declared their appearance to be merely a “vision”. (Matt. 17:9; compare therewith Acts 12: 9, where Peter “wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">vision&quot;.)</span><span class="font5"> It is true that Moses is dead and must await the resurrection, and it is true that Elijah was taken up in a fiery chariot by a whirlwind; but that has no relationship whatsoever to the transfiguration vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The overshadowing important part of the transfiguration was the announcement by the voice from heaven that the Lord Jesus is the approved One of Jehovah and the One who is the Chief Officer of Jehovah for the vindication of God’s name. The voice out of the cloud said: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (Matt. 17:5) Here in substance is the emphatic statement from Jehovah God that Christ Jesus is God’s great High Priest, Judge and King, to whom all creation must render absolute obedience, because God in due time would send Christ Jesus to be his Vindicator and to carry out all His purposes and this would be done when Christ Jesus is enthroned as the Ruler and the Judge of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The overshadowing cloud symbolically spoke of the presence of the invisible Jehovah, and the fact that the cloud overshadowed the three disciples who were eyewitnesses also suggests that the fulfillment of this prophetic vision would take place at the time of the second presence of the Lord, in the spirit, concerning which Jesus said, at Matthew 16:28: “Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” The words which the three disciples heard expressed by a voice out of the cloud would pjean that Christ Jesus had maintained his integrity towards Jehovah; and the further fact that Jesus warned them that they were to tell the vision to no man “until the Son of man be risen again from the dead” shows that the exaltation of Jesus to the position of honor would be after his resurrection, to which facts the apostles subsequently testified.—Phil. 2:5-11; Heb. 5:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus had been sent by his Father to the earth to do his Father's will, and Jesus had been wholly obedient to his Father. Jesus declared he was sent to bear witness to the truth, and his faithfulness in the performance of his commission earned for him the title “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev. 3:14; 19:11) The words which the three eyewitnesses heard from the cloud disclosed the necessity for them to be likewise obedient to Jehovah God and that, since Jesus spoke with authority, therefore whatsoever he commanded they must obey. This fixes the rule that all the followers of Jesus must obey his commandments. Obedience is one of the fixed rules of Jehovah, and there is no deviation therefrom permitted. God’s inflexible rule concerning his creatures was long ago announced, at 1 Samuel 15: 22, 23, to wit: “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice; . . . For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft [the turning away from God to the Devil], and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry [that is, as lawlessness and devil-worship].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A fulfillment of the prophetic vision of transfiguration is after the Lord Jesus comes to the temple. Christ Jesus at the temple is the Greater Moses and the one whom Moses typified. In the transfiguration Moses there pictured that Christ Jesus is the great Prophet. When this great Prophet appears at the temple for judgment, from 1918 onward, the following words uttered by Peter apply specifically to all those who are brought to a knowledge and understanding of the truth, to wit: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after [him], as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.” (Acts 3: 22-24) All the prophets of God had foretold the coming of the King, the Messiah or Christ; therefore upon the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple all who were called to the heavenly kingdom must render absolute obedience unto the Greater Moses, in order to maintain their integrity towards Jehovah. This great and important truth is taught and magnified by the transfiguration on the mountain and what was there said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have not been teachable and obedient to the great Prophet upon his coming to the temple have made no progress in gaining a knowledge of God’s will in wisdom and spiritual understanding. Many who were once in line for the Kingdom have since become blind, and they deny the coming of the Lord to the temple; and manifestly the apostle Peter speaks of these disobedient ones at the time Christ Jesus is at the temple for judgment, and he calls them ungodly, in the following words: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?”—1 Pet. 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the specific commandments given to the consecrated Christians by the Lord Jesus at his coming to the temple is, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) Some professed Christians have thought they could ignore this command and still get into heaven; but all the scriptures appearing upon the point show that they cannot ignore this commandment, refuse to have a part in the witness work amongst the people, and yet have an entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Only those who obey receive the Lord’s approval; and this was emphasized at the transfiguration vision by Jehovah’s words out of the cloud: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him”; that is to say, ‘obey him.’ To hear what the great Prophet now says means, not idleness, but diligence in performing the work which he has commanded shall be done, namely, giving the witness concerning Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>NO APOLOGIES FOR THEOCRACY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">R</span><span class="font5">ELIGIOUS hypocrisy is rampant today as in the days of Noah before the Flood, the great visitation of Jehovah God. What, then, is meant by Peter the apostle when he says to those who are Christian “strangers&quot; to this wicked world rule of Satan: “Having your conversation [conduct] honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation” ?—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These inspired words mean that the one who is anointed of the Lord God to serve as his commissioned witness must, amongst the nations and peoples of earth, pursue a course of action that is honest and true. He must manifest the spirit of virtue, which is true manliness, and steadfastness and immovability in things pertaining to Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It means that such anointed witnesses and their earthly “companions” must pursue a course of action that is consistent with one who loves God and who gives his entire allegiance to Him. It means that he refuses to compromise in any manner with the Devil, who is “the god of this world”, or with any of his systems, religious, political or commercial. It means to be kind and considerate, yet firm for God and for his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By contact with the One anointed to be the King of The Theocracy Peter had learned what are the proper speech and proper course of action for an honest man devoted to Almighty God. His association with the King eminently qualified him to give advice to his fellow witnesses, At Acts of the Apostles, chapter four, verse thirteen, it is written concerning Peter and John when before the religious trial court at Jerusalem: “And they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.” Time and again this statement has been explained to mean that all with whom we come in contact should be able to see by our “sweetness of spirit”, by our “patience under provocation”, that we have indeed been with Jesus and learned of him. The misunderstanding of this scripture has made many a man a “sissy” and caused him to appear before others with the air of apology for being a Christian. This has caused many a Christian to quail in the presence of those opposed to the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not to understand that Jesus was long-faced, easy-going, easy-speaking, and careful to say nothing that might grate upon the ears of the opponents of the truth and The Theocracy. Because many have misunderstood what manner of man Jesus was they have followed this easy-going method and have been exceedingly careful never to say anything that might grate upon the ears of the rich, influential and great in this world. Religionists have, been led to believe that this was the kind of men the apostles were, and that because of their apparent piety, long faces, sanctimoniousness, sweetness and patience others took note of them that they had been with Jesus and learned of him. Such is a misrepresentation of the Lord Jesus and a misrepresentation of his apostles. The context of Acts 4:13 shows plainly that such a conclusion is incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real facts have been hid by quoting only a part of the above text, and that out of its proper setting. The circumstances were as follows: It was shortly after Pentecost and the outpouring of God’s holy spirit upon those devoted to him and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Peter and John had boldly declared the gospel of Christ the King, and him crucified for maintaining his integrity toward God. The ecclesiastics, made up of the priests and religious Pharisees, financiers and politicians, were offended, and caused them to be put into prison. On the day following, John and Peter were brought before the high priest and others of that august assembly. The high priest demanded to know by what power and authority these men were speaking and healing the sick. Peter, with boldness and frankness of speech, replied: “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.”—Acts 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was not much apology in those words, and evidently they did not fall with much sweetness on the ears of the high priest and his associates. It was not necessary for the two apostles to be rude and harsh, yet Peter plainly said to these fellows, ‘You murdered the Lord! But God raised him up from the dead.’ The apostles made no apology for representing Jesus Christ the King, nor for trusting implicitly in Jehovah, the great Theocrat. They did not cringe and quail before that body of proud and arrogant ecclesiastics. Fearlessly and with plainness of speech they told the truth. Therefore it is written (Acts 4:13) : “Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What was the effect of this! Their speech and course of action identified them as followers of Christ. Here the word “boldness” (Greek: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parrhesia}</span><span class="font5"> means frankness, bluntness, speaking freely and with confidence, outspokenness. This proves what kind of man Jesus was, of whom the apostles learned. It also proves that Jesus has been grossly misrepresented by others. Grace was poured upon Jesus’ lips. (Ps. 45:2) But that did not mean that he had to rub his hands, stroke his chin like religionists’ pulling their beard, and look down when he spoke to somebody else. Jesus was straightforward. He was an honest man. He was a real man. He represented his Father, “the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font5"> of Eternity,” who has all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus hesitated not to tell the religious rulers that they not only were wrong, but were willingly so, and were criminals. His speech was so straightforward and frank that it could not be disputed. When the apostles appeared before the ecclesiastical body on that occasion their speech also was so bold, fearless and frank that the ecclesiastics, wagging their heads to each other, recognized that these men had been with Jesus and were followers of him. It is not necessary to think that they were rude or harsh, but they were straightforward, confident and fearless in what they had to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many professed Christians have been induced to believe that they must be so sweet in the presence of the enemy that the enemy may take note of their sweetness and say, ‘That is a Christian.’ There is no scripture that warrants a Christian in taking such a course. Christians, above all others, should be real men and women. As representatives of The Theocracy, they should deport themselves in a dignified way, with frankness and straightforwardness. That is what the apostle Paul said about it. He stated: ‘Let your conversation, or course of action, be as becometh a Christian.’ To quote his words at Philippians 1:27,28 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{'Weymouth </span><span class="font5">translation): “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the Good News. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation—a token coming from God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his epistle the apostle Peter was telling his Christian brethren to be real men, and to be so honest and straightforward in speech and in action that there would be no mistake about it in the minds of others that here are men and women who are real Christians and are not ashamed of it. If all those who go witnessing from door to door concerning The Theocratic Government would get the right view of this matter they would not fear or quail, but would feel an absolute confidence in Jehovah and that they are representing him and his Government of Righteousness. A man or a woman is most highly honored by being made the ambassador of Christ and the representative of the Most High God, the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should anyone feel ashamed or manifest an apologetic air in the presence of others because of being a witness for Jehovah! On the contrary, the spirit of the Lord should give him such complete confidence that he would always speak with frankness and straightforwardness concerning the great God and his King and Kingdom. This honest course of action and speech will bring reproach upon the Lord’s faithful ones; but, says the apostle, ‘in the day of God’s visitation many will glorify God that the witness was boldly given.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following that day of Pentecost of A.D. 33 the zeal and unswerving devotion of the apostles to God and to Christ were shown. Many of the people saw the honesty and consistency of their course. Because of their faithfulness the apostles were evilly spoken of by many. But doubtless many observed their zeal and straightforwardness for the Lord God and were inherently glad. It was doubtless the zeal and boldness of these faithful witnesses that induced Cornelius to often pray to God, before Peter was sent to him and God did there for the first time visit the Gentiles (nonJews) to take out of them a people for his name. (Acts 10; Acts 15:14) Now a similar condition arises; and it becomes the privilege and duty of the witnesses of Jehovah on earth to be equally zealous, straightforward and honest in their course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now Jehovah God has made clear what is the primary issue before all creation, to wit, </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">universal domination. </span><span class="font5">Who is for Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government, and who is not? Before the final overthrow of Satan’s organization, during the time of Jehovah’s visitation, he will have a witness given in the earth concerning his purposes toward his creatures. To the anointed servant class Jehovah God says: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:12) That means, then, that every one who is anointed with God’s spirit is commissioned to perform this duty; and this he must do in proportion to his opportunities, in order to be acceptable to and blessed of the Lord. If one thinks that because of his standing amongst the brethren some part of the Lord’s service is menial for him he does injury to himself. Some who have been “elective elders” have thought such work as going from door to door and putting the books into the hands of the people should be done by the weaker ones or less prominent ones of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question is, Can it be said of suchlike that they are taking a stand on the side of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government, and that their course of action is honest and consistent, within the meaning of the apostle’s words at 1 Peter 2:12? What is here said is not written for the purpose of holding anyone up to harsh criticism, but as a warning for the benefit of those who are neglecting their opportunities. It is not the part of one Christian to criticize another for not going into the field. It is his duty to beseech his brother to put forth the proper zeal, and when that is done the Scriptures do not advise to do more. (Rom. 12:1) The brethren would be negligent of their duty, however, if they did not mention to each other the great responsibility that rests upon the ones in a covenant to do God’s will during and up to the great visitation of God upon the nations. The day of God’s visitation upon so-called “Christendom” began shortly after his great Messenger, Christ Jesus, came to the temple for judgment, as foretold at Malachi 3:1, and it will continue with increased severity until all parts of Satan’s visible organization on earth are overthrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful ones who with continued zeal and devotion to the Lord have consistently given a witness to the name of Jehovah and to his Christ the King have been targets for the darts of the enemy and have received harsh criticisms from many and have been denounced as evildoers. At the same time there doubtless have been and are yet many who, like Cornelius, have desired something better and have been praying for deliverance. The facts show that many are hearing the truth now who in times past have spoken against faithful witnesses of Jehovah. The effect of the witness is increasing, and the number of those who are associating themselves with the anointed remnant as their “companions” is increasing. (Ps. 122:8; Ps. 45:14) Now as never before the words of the apostle Peter come to these, saying, Tjet your course of action be honest now, that even those who speak evil against you shall see your good works and in the day of God’s visitation shall glorify his name.’ In this day of God’s visitation before his expressed indignation at Armageddon many more will yet call to mind the honest and consistent course of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and will praise Him that he had some faithful witnesses in the earth who gave them warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let no one make the great blunder now of making himself believe that the “good works” mentioned here by the apostle consist in what is generally known as ‘Christian character development’. Outward piety is not what the apostle had in mind. Without a question of doubt he had in mind the same thing as that expressed by the apostle John, to wit, that love for God would be manifested in boldness in the proclamation of the message concerning the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by His King Christ Jesus.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man who is honestly representing an honest superior never feels he must make any apology, either by word or action, for pressing the interest of his cause. The truly anointed ones and their “companions” are representing the great Theocrat Jehovah and his King and Government of Righteousness. Surely there is no occasion for these or any one of them to apologize, by word or by course of action, while representing the Lord. Because of the importance to the covenant people of God, individually and collectively, and because of the great opportunity to glorify God, now that the hour is approaching for the great and final visitation of Jehovah God upon the nations of the earth at Armageddon, every one of his devoted people is urged to put forth the greatest possible zeal and earnestness in the representation of his Theocratic Government. When the work is done it will be a blessed and happy thing to be told by the Lord that their honest course of action in representing him has brought glory to his name. Such faithfulness will be rewarded in full keeping with God’s loving-kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The honor now to be bestowed upon the name of Jehovah by those now on earth who devote themselves unreservedly to the Lord is to proclaim his name and his Theocracy as his witnesses. Only those who joyfully do this can have the final approval of the Lord henceforth. The necessity, therefore, for joyful participation in the service of the Lord God cannot be overstated. As the apostle Paul urged upon the brethren zealous activity, even so now we should urge upon one another the same thing.—Rom. 12:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“We stopped to inquire where we could find a certain interested person, whereupon the service station operator invited us to park our trailer there. As we prepared to move on the next day, the station owner strolled over to inquire if we didn’t like the little town, as we were moving on so soon. I replied such was not the case, but that as we were Jehovah’s witnesses, calling on the people with </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> publications, we must be on our way to the rest of our assignment. He drew in his breath and stammered: ‘Wh-who did you say! Say that again—do you mean you are one of those people who do not have to salute the flag!’ ‘Yes; do you know why we take that stand! You know we respect the flag as much as anyone, but regard the salute a violation of God’s commandment as stated in the Bible.

(We had heard about the trouble there before we came here, when the friends were ordered off the streets with the magazines and even threatened with mob violence if they didn’t leave town, and how one officer seemed to particularly have a vicious attitude—and </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">this</span><span class="font5"> was the man!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“He proceeded to say he had worried about the incident for months, couldn’t sleep nights for feeling he was wrong. He asked question after question, requesting answers then and there, stating he had truly believed he was obeying the unwritten law in ridding the large town of Jehovah’s witnesses. My husband returned and, the phonograph being secured, played the latest short record for him. By this time his manner appeared as of one really contrite of heart and seeking the truth. When Paul’s persecution of faithful Christians was read from the Bible, he asked if we would convey his apologies to Jehovah’s witnesses at Silver City (those he had accosted) and tell them he as well as the other two officers involved had resigned as police because they saw their mistake. He asked if Jehovah would forgive him, proceeded to subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> took the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> saying he had always known the churches were a racket, and asked if we had an extra Bible, which he also obtained. Just before I left he also stated that if he were going to be interested in this work he thought it best to cancel his plans to marry, because he knew the woman to be opposed to the truth; he was going to send a wire telling her to stay where she was and to forget about the wedding, which was to have taken place in the next few days. We have a cordial invitation to return, extended to all of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DURING THE LAST &quot;BUTZ” ON GLASGOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While pavement witnessing, a lady came up and took a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> saying she had all of Judge Rutherford’s books. I inquired whether she had heard any of his recordings. She had not, so I arranged a date. At the end of our model study the air-raid sirens sounded, and they invited me to go into their air-raid shelter, as I was quite away from home. So into the shelter I went. Three others, including her son, who had not been in the room during the model study, also came. The son had previously said he would rather go to bed than listen to Judge Rutherford. However, in the shelter, he asked me to put the records on. The result was that eight persons listened, and we spent from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. discussing ‘Government and Peace’. The young people went to sleep, but the mother and son kept me answering questions until the ‘raiders passed’ sirens sounded, at 5 a.m. I had started the morning before at 9: 30 a.m. and had put in seven hours, and my evening call took another seven hours. I arrived home in the morning and found the whole neighborhood around my home extensively damaged, but my own home was all right. The windows in the tenements above and below had been blown out. I reached home at 7 a.m. and at 10 a.m. I was on the work again. The thrill of the model study and the witness in the shelter seemed to have taken away all tiredness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON BRANCH SERVANT IN DERBY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I was finishing running the ‘Message of Hope’ disc to the wife when the husband appeared, trying to cut short the call. I tried to reason with him a bit, but be finally said he was fed up with religion and he didn’t want to have anything more to do with it and would be pleased if I would get going. He said there was only one real Christian in England and that was Judge Rutherford. Imagine my surprise! In a last effort before he closed the door I showed him that the book I had was written by that very same person. He quickly opened the door again and I continued the witness. He took some literature, and I arranged for a back-call. I almost missed this ‘sheep’. We are finding many people thoroughly disgusted with the ‘churches’, and to them the message of The Theocracy is like food to a famished person. Every week-end in various parts of the country where I serve the brethren marvelous experiences are related, just as the ‘Victory Song’ says: ‘There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord.’ (Judges 5:11)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ON A CORNER OF SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As I started for my assigned corner I thought I might just as well offer a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to a man standing in front of a store. Based on the September 1 issue, on the subject ‘Is Religion Holy!’ he was soon agreeing that religion was not holy, but a racket. Said I: ‘I have a phonograph record right there in my car entitled “Snare and Racket” that you would enjoy. Do you want to hear it!’ Said he: ‘I would close up my store to hear that!’ I told him he need not do that, as I would take the record into his store; which I did, and played the recording. He thanked me for the ‘great favor’ and took a magazine. Returning to the car with the phonograph, a Spanish man asked me for a magazine ; he took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> Then, while I spoke a little Spanish to him, he followed me to my car, I took out my box of foreign literature and he gladly contributed for two more booklets, meanwhile calling a Greek passer-by over to see the books. A short discussion with the Greek, and he took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font5"> in Greek. Result: In a few minutes, within 100 feet of my car, I had placed two magazines, three booklets, played the phonograph, and obtained three names for back-calls.”</span></p>

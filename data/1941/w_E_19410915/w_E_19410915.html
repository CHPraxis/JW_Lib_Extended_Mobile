<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The END shall be at the time appointed.&quot;—Dan. 11:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH has suffered Satan, the chief of demons, together with his associates, to exercise ruling power over the nations for many centuries, but the end of that rule must come some time. Responding to the challenge of the chief of demons, Jehovah long ago said: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain; for to show thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’ (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font8"> It must be concluded that it was then that God appointed the time for the end of Satanic rule; for “known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world”. (Acts 15:18) By his prophets Jehovah has frequently told of the “time of the end” and what shall take place at that time. By his prophet Daniel the Almighty says: “The END shall be at the time appointed.” Those words are a guarantee from Jehovah that the end of the rule of the world by the demons shall come, and that at the time he has appointed. Nothing can change that time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Daniel was in a covenant with Jehovah God and was faithful to that covenant. Jehovah permitted him to be carried away as a prisoner into Babylon, where God used him for His own good purpose. Daniel was a faithful prophet and witness for Jehovah. He is included among the list of faithful witnesses described by the apostle at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, where he is referred to as one “who through faith . . . stopped the mouths of lions”. (Heb. 11:33) Daniel is certain to have a “better resurrection” and to be one of the “princes in all the earth”. (Heb. 11:35; Ps. 45:16) He finished his course as a faithful servant and prophet of God, and died like other men and went to rest in the grave, where there is no knowledge nor device, and there to remain until God’s due time to awaken him out of death. The time of his resurrection may be any day now, when he, as one of earth’s governors, shall appear on the earth and assume his divinely appointed office. About this there can be no doubt, because God said to Daniel when he had completed prophesying: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.” —Dan. 12: 4,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Many students of divine prophecy have sought to understand the prophecy of Daniel; but the rule concerning the understanding of prophecy is undoubtedly this: That prophecy cannot be understood by human creatures until it is in course of fulfillment or has been fulfilled. The physical facts, which God permits to come to pass, we may put along beside prophecy, and when they fit we may know that is evidence of the fulfillment. God told Daniel that the full understanding of prophecy would be only at “the time of the end”.—Dan. 12: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> It is first necessary, then, to ascertain what is meant by “the time of the end”. Since time never ends, the words “the time of the end” must mean a time when that which opposes Almighty God, and continues to do so without interruption or hindrance from God, comes to an end; and that is when the divine hindrance of the wicked rule begins. There are two positive lines of Scriptural proof showing “the time of the end” began in A.D. 1914. Just how long thereafter the final end comes is not revealed to creatures up to the present time. No one has authority to attempt to say just what day or hour the final end arrives.—Matt. 24: 42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah God made known his purpose to create and set up a Theocratic government by the Messiah, whom he describes as “the seed of Abraham”, and which seed is The Christ. (Gal. 4:28-31) Jehovah had a typical Theocracy, which began when he delivered the natural descendants of Abraham from the land of Egypt. That typical Theocracy was bitterly opposed then and thereafter by the chief of demons, Satan, and his associate demons and agents. The great issue which the Devil had raised was world domination. The descendants of Abraham, that is to say, the Israelites, the typical people of God, were taken into a covenant. That people became unfaithful to their covenant, and in the year 606 B.C. God permitted that typical Theocracy by Zedekiah, who</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">was king, to be overthrown. (Ezek. 21: 24-27) There Satan became the “god”, or invisible ruler, of the world, because then and thereafter no nation was in a covenant with Jehovah. There “the times of the Gentiles [that is to say, people not in a covenant with God]” began. God there fixed the period of the Gentile times at 2,520 years, and which period of time came to an end in A.D. 1914. (Luke 21: 24; Dan. 4:16,23,25,32) The invisible rule by Satan continued throughout that period of time by the sufferance of Jehovah and until the enthronement of Christ Jesus, the Messiah, which enthronement took place in A. D. 1914. (Ps. 2:6) The facts are fully supported by the prophecy uttered by Jesus and recorded at Matthew 24 and Luke 21. It was at that time, A.D. 1914, that Jehovah sent forth his anointed One, the King of The Theocracy, to rule while the enemy, Satan, was still holding on to and exercising his power. (Ps. 110:1, 2) That date therefore marks the end of Satan’s rule of the world without hindrance or interruption. Therefore it marks “the time of the end”, that is to say, the time beginning when Christ Jesus began his work of ousting the enemy Satan. The beginning of “the time of the end” is therefore definitely fixed by the Lord’s Word. From that time forward the name of Jehovah and his kingdom must be proclaimed as a witness to the nations of earth, and when that is done then shall the final end come (Matt. 24:14), and with the world’s greatest tribulation, which is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, resulting in the complete destruction of Satan’s rule and power and putting out all of his agencies and associates. (Matt. 24:21; Rev. 16:14) The length of “the time of the end” is not stated in the Scriptures, but the beginning of “the time of the end” is fully and definitely stated. (See Book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font8"> chapter 6.) Be it noted that there is a clear distinction between “the time of the end” and the final end of the rule by demons. Both are fixed by the Lord and, of course, both are well known by him, but the latter date is not revealed yet to man. By the circumstances and physical facts now observed the fulfillment of the prophecy strongly indicates that the final end is very near. The promise to Daniel was that the understanding of the prophecy would be impossible “until the time of the end” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham')</span><span class="font8"> ; and therefore the prophecy could not be understood until after the coming of the Lord Jesus in 1914. The fact that the Lord now begins to reveal the meaning of this prophecy to his people is strong circumstantial proof that Daniel may be expected soon to return to the earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• That part of Daniel’s prophecy set forth at chapter eleven of the Bible record is of peculiar interest to the people of Jehovah at the present time, because it deals with two separate wings of Satan’s organization, both of which oppose The Theocracy. It also makes clear that the day of deliverance is near. The prophecy of the eleventh chapter of Daniel was given to him by the Lord about 534 B.C., at which time the angel of Jehovah said to Daniel: “Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for yet [after that time begins] the vision [shall be] for many days.” (Dan. 10:14) The prophecy of the eleventh chapter of Daniel was then delivered to Daniel, which he states that he did not understand. (Dan. 12:8) Daniel therefore pictured or represented God’s faithful people who are on the earth at and during “the time of the end”, that is to say, in the “latter days”; hence it is Jehovah’s witnesses that are given the privilege of understanding the prophecy at the present time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">' The prophecy at Daniel the eleventh chapter was delivered “in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia”. (Dan. 10:1) That was two years after the decree of Cyrus, the king, was made and entered directing the Jewish captives to go free from restraint from Babylon and to return to Jerusalem to there build Jehovah’s temple. Cyrus was there used in picture as a type of Christ Jesus. To correspond with that decree issued by the king of Persia, Christ Jesus, the Greater Cyrus, began his reign in full authority in 1914, and thereafter in 1918 came to the temple of Jehovah and gathered unto himself his faithful servants and followers to the temple: “Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Isa. 45:1,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ Christ Jesus has builded the temple of Jehovah and has released the faithful servants of God (pictured by Daniel), to wit: Jehovah’s witnesses, “the remnant,” releasing them from modern-day Babylon, that is, Satan’s organization, and sets them free to go forth and have part in the temple work of the Most High; and therefore now is the due time for God to reveal to his faithful people the meaning of the prophecy under consideration. That being true, the time for Daniel’s resurrection and return to his place, or “lot”, on the earth as one of the princes of the earth is very near. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus now on the earth may look forward with confidence to seeing Daniel among them almost any time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">* Daniel’s prophecy, recorded at the eleventh chapter, from verses one to twenty-two, seems to refer to sequence of events that came to pass prior to the crucifixion of Christ Jesus, and probably the record of that part of the prophecy was the means employed by the Lord to conceal the meaning of the latter part until his due time to make it known. Verse twenty-two of that eleventh chapter of the prophecy, to wit, “And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant,” appears to mark the crossing over of the prophecy from the time before Christ to the period Anno Domini, or period after Christ. It foretells the violent death of “the prince of the covenant”, that is, Christ Jesus, who was in a covenant with Jehovah for the great Theocratic Government. (Luke 22:29,30) Christ Jesus, “The prince of the kings,” was killed by the representatives of the Roman power, being crucified at the instigation of religious leaders of the Jews. There “the prince of the covenant” was broken.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> At verse twenty-seven, of chapter eleven, is the beginning of the prophecy relating to modern times, that is, since the coming of the Lord Jesus in power and glory to the temple. It now appears to be Jehovah’s time for his covenant people to receive from the Lord an understanding of the prophecy, and so with full confidence in Jehovah and his King they reverently and joyfully approach the examination of the prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROMINENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> The prophecy places emphasis on two prominent powers, to wit, “the king of the south” and “the king of the north”. Those kings are not two men, but are two visible ruling powers in the world, in which men play a part but in which individuals or men are not the chief things or part. The word “king” is a symbol which stands for the power that rules. As an illustration, the king of the nation, that is, the individual with that title, usually is a symbol of a government; whereas the real directing power of the kingdom or government is composed of a number of men. Be it noted that both “the king of the south” and “the king of the north” are engaged in actions that are unrighteous and wicked, and hence they could not represent Jehovah and Christ or any part of The Theocracy. On the contrary, they are both opposed to The Theocracy. They are rival powers in this world, both seeking world domination; and since the Scriptures make it clear that ‘the whole world lieth in the wicked one’, it follows that both “the king of the south” and “the king of the north” are controlled by the demons, of which Satan the Devil is the chief. Both of those kings or ruling powers are instruments of Satan, created and organized by him to blind the people to the truth and to turn them away from Jehovah God and Christ his King. The identification of those two world ruling-powers, designated as “kings”, is necessarily essential to an understanding of the prophecy. Their identification is named below, and evidence is submitted in support thereof, which evidence embraces the language of the prophecy and the physical facts which have come to pass, and which are now well known. They fit the prophecy, and hence can be confidently taken as a fulfillment thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> “The king of the north,” is that satanic ruling power, created and organized by Satan, who declared that he would sit in authority “in the sides of the north” as a rival of and in defiance of the Almighty God Jehovah (Isa. 14:13,14); and which ruling power over humankind is totalitarian and dictatorial, and which rules and claims the right to rule the nations of the earth. It is violently opposed to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and opposes and persecutes and wickedly ill-treats those who advocate and proclaim the Theocratic rule. Religion and politics are the chief or prominent visible elements of “the king of the north”. Religion is demonism, and is so defined by the infallible Word of God, set forth in the Bible at Acts 17: 22, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott </span><span class="font8">translation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">” Such dictatorial ruling power was first brought into action by the chief of demons when he put his servant Nimrod on the throne, who became the dictatorial or arbitrary ruler of Babylon. Nimrod caused the people to recognize him as a mighty one before the Lord, that is, one in advance of Almighty God. He required them to hail him and to bow down before and worship him. He ruled the people with an arbitrary and iron hand. Thus religion (or demonism) and politics operated together to exercise dominion or ruling power over the world. (Gen. 10:8-12) This is further supported by the following: “Nimrod persuaded mankind not to ascribe their happiness to God, but to think that his own excellency was the source of it. And he soon changed things into a tyranny, thinking there was no other way to wean men from the fear of God than by making them rely upon his own power. The Targum of Jonathan says: ‘From the foundation of the world none was ever found like Nimrod, powerful in hunting, and in rebellions against the Lord.’ The Jerusalem Targum says: ‘He was powerful in hunting and in wickedness before the Lord, for he was a hunter of the sons of men, and he said to them, “Depart from the judgment of the Lord, and adhere to the judgment of Nimrod!” There is it said: “As Nimrod (is) the strong, strong in hunting, and in wickedness before Jehovah.” ’ The Chaldee paraphrase of 1 Chronicles 1:10 says: ‘Cush begat Nimrod, who began to prevail in wickedness, for he shed innocent blood, and rebelled against Jehovah.’ Nimrod was the founder of Babylon, which [symbolizes Satan’s organization and] partook of his character as being the great antagonist of God’s Truth and God’s people. We cannot fail to see, in Nimrod, Satan’s first attempt to raise up a human universal ruler of men.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—The Companion Bible,</span><span class="font8"> footnote, Appendix No. 28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> Evidence aside from the Bible shows that from Nimrod’s time to the present day every world dictator has been a religionist. Each and every one employs demonism to keep the people in subjection while the dictator exercises complete political ruling power, controlling the people arbitrarily. The unbroken line of testimony is that all world dictators have been demon-controlled and their rule therefore has been demon rule, and that rule is always exercised in defiance of Almighty God and His commandments as set forth in the Bible. Nimrod has been followed by many world dictators, and those of the present time manifest the same spirit as that manifested by Nimrod.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup> Today (1941) “the king of the north” is easily identified as being represented in the so-called “Axis powers” composed of Greater Germany, Italy, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with chief offices at Vatican City. Here again politics and religion, or demonism, form a combination to rule and to keep the people in ignorance of Jehovah’s gracious provision for mankind. The chief objective of this present-day “king of the north” is world domination. Politics and demonism work together, forming an arbitrary or totalitarian combine, the present objective of which is to establish once again what is called “the Holy Roman Empire”. The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> of February 17, 1940, published the following pertinent statement: “The German war aims were outlined tonight [at Washington] as a re-establishment of the Holy Roman Empire by [the Roman Catholic priest] Doctor Edmund A. Walsh, regent of the Foreign Service School of Georgetown [Catholic] University. . . . Dr. Walsh said that he had heard Adolf Hitler say that the Holy Roman Empire, which was a Germanic Empire, must be reestablished.” The undisputed facts show that Hitler and his allies are moving forward with that very purpose in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>16</sup> “The king of the north,” as the same now exists and operates, is the religious and political totalitarian Corporate State, which controls and regiments the people of the nations under the same, by employing strong military force, all of which receives the approval and blessing of the clergy, particularly the pope. It is a Hierarchy government. It is violently opposed to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and viciously persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses, who announce The Theocracy and who proclaim the supremacy of Jehovah and his King, the rightful Ruler of the world, that is, Christ Jesus. That “the king of the north” is a child of the chief of demons, Satan, there cannot be the slightest doubt. The authoritative statement of the Lord is that the Devil is the father of lies and a murderer and that in him there is no truth, and that religious leaders are the children of their father the Devil; and such are the ones now used to make up “the king of the north”. (John 8:44) The present-day 'Ling of the north” is given entirely to lying and to murder on a worldwide scale, and its every mark testifies that it is the offspring of demons and under demon control.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>17</sup> Well knowing that he could not fool the people with one world-wide scheme the Devil organized another, which on the face of it appears to have some regard for the people; but that same other scheme or kingly power is used to blind and mislead the people and turn them away from The Theocracy. That other scheme is designated in the prophecy of Daniel as “the king of the south”. The Bible and physical and historical facts plainly identify “the king of the south” as the world ruling-power that claims the right to rule and rules in the name of Democracy. The correct definition of “democracy” is: “A rule of the people, by the people, and for the welfare of the people.” The nations of earth which claim to be democracies do not measure up to the correct definition of Democracy. “The king of the south” is controlled by the combined elements of politics, religion and commerce, the binding tie being religion or demonism. That form of world power had its beginning with ancient Egypt. That first world power was visibly ruled by the combined elements of religion, politics and commerce. The Bible plainly shows that that was a demonized rule and was against Almighty God and opposed him and his servants.—Ex. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> The modern-day “king of the south”, since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, is represented in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and other nations which claim to be democratic and which therefore are allied with the British Empire. The British are more nearly democratic than any other nation on earth, and yet there is no real democracy on the earth. The World War of 1914’s slogan was: “This war will make the world safe for democracy”; but that prediction did not come to pass. “The king of the north” and “the king of the south” are both violently opposed to each other, and both claim the right to rule, and hence both are seeking world domination. Only in one thing do they agree, and that is, both are against The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. “The king of the north” is openly opposed to The Theocracy. Both of said kings claim to be Christian, but not one of them is for Christ. There is no so-called “democracy” on earth that advocates The Theocratic Government by Christ; and Christ Jesus testifies: “He that is not with me [and my kingdom] is against me.” (Matt. 12:30) Clearly, then, both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” are world powers, contending one with the other for world domination, and hence both against the world's rightful and righteous rule, to wit, The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> Some historical facts concerning “the king of the south” here seem pertinent to the matter under consideration. Ancient Egypt was a rival of Rome for many centuries, but in the year 31 B.C. Egypt became a province of Rome and remained in that condition for some time. After the battle of Actium (31 B.C.) Egypt passed into the condition of a province of Rome, governed always by a Roman governor of the equestrian, not senatorial, rank. On the dividing of the great Roman Empire by Theodosius (A.D. 337) into the Western and Eastern empires, Egypt became a province of the latter (the Eastern Empire), and sank deeper and deeper in barbarism and weakness. Thus Egypt became separated from Rome. It then became the prey of the Saracens, ’Amribu-el-asr, their general under the Caliph Omar, taking Alexandria, their capital, by assault. This happened A.D. 641, when Heraclius was the emperor of the East. As a province of the caliphs it was under the government of the celebrated Abbassides—Haroun el-Rashid and Al-Mamon, and that of the famous Sultan Saladin. (1516-17) Egypt became a Turkish province, governed by a pasha. (1798) The French then conquered the whole of Egypt and held it until 1801, when they were driven out by the British under Abercromby and Hutchison. Suez Canal was opened in 1869. In November 1875 the British government bought from the viceroy of Egypt his interest in the Suez Canal, consisting of 176,602 shares, for $20,000,000.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> Further, says the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Americana,</span><span class="font8"> Volume 9: ‘Tn May 1882, a rising took place in Alexandria, when many Europeans were killed and their houses pillaged. . . .

In August a force under Sir Garnet (afterward Lord) Wolseley landed at Ismailia. . . .</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>21</sup> Says the 1940 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Almanac,</span><span class="font8"> page 226: “The Suez Canal . . . Great Britain owns 295,026 of the 652,932 shares now outstanding and carries them among its assets at a valuation of £93,200,000. . . . Originally a part of the Turkish Empire, Egypt became a British Protectorate (December, 1914) and remained under the British flag until a kingdom was established with Sultan Fuad as sovereign (March 15, 1922). An Anglo-Egyptian treaty of alliance was signed (August 26, 1936) which limited British military occupation to a garrison of 10,000 troops and 400 airplanes at the Suez Canal, and which accorded the British the right to use Alexandria and Port Said as naval bases. The treaty further permits the British government to move troops over Egyptian territory in the event or threat of war.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> Under the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 Egypt is supporting Great Britain in the war against the Axis powers. In September, 1939, the German nationals were ordered to leave Egypt. Some more physical facts recorded in a world Encyclopedia follow:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Tn A.D. 1531 King Henry VIII of England broke away from the Papacy and established a Protestant nation. Under his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, England began her commercial expansion and the foundations of the British Empire were laid. In 1588 the Spanish Armada, blessed by the pope, was defeated by the British in its attempt to invade, which Roman Catholic attempt Hitler is trying to duplicate at present. One hundred years later, in 1688, came the “Glorious Revolution” and the final overthrow of despotism in England, and the establishment of constitutional government. A Bill of Rights was established, the third great guarantee of English liberty. The year 1759 was the “Annus Mirabilis”, the most wonderful year in England’s history; it gave her Canada, and overthrew the Roman Catholic French supremacy, and led to the Treaty of Paris, and the establishment of England’s great Colonial Empire. Meantime the 13 American colonies were part of the British Empire. In 1776 the American Republic was established, and in 1783, at the close of the American Revolution, the absolutism of King George III of Great Britain was overthrown. Thus Great Britain and America constituted the stronghold of liberal, democratic, Protestant government.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>23</sup> In the Bible the name “Egypt” is used symbolically and there symbolizes commercialism, in which politics and religion also play a prominent part. The British Empire and its present-day ally, America, represent particularly commerce, politics and religion. The Axis powers denounce the so-called “democratic powers” as money-grabbers or commercialists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> When Jesus the King was a child God directed that he be carried down to Egypt, the land of “the king of the south”, where He had protection from the murderous spirit of the representatives of “the king of the north”; thus indicating that “the king of the south” was more favorable to the Christ-child. (Matt. 2:12-16) Likewise in these last days, when the desire of “the king of the north” is to destroy the faithful “remnant” of Christ, who are witnesses for Jehovah on the earth, they are directed to carry on the work assigned to them, particularly within the territory occupied by “the king of the south”, where they have had some measure of liberty and receive much greater favor than from “the king of the north”. Wherever the representatives of “the king of the north”, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy portion thereof, have exercised influence and power over the representatives of “the king of the south”, there Jehovah’s witnesses have had their liberties curtailed and have suffered much persecution. Even within the realm of “the king of the south” the influence and power of Satan and his allies is now made manifest on every part of the earth. Demonism has laid hold on every nation even as in Noah’s day, but without any exception, exactly as Jesus foretold, his faithful followers, the witnesses of Jehovah, are now hated of all nations for his name’s sake. (Matt. 24: 9) There could be no doubt about the fact that God’s covenant people are subjected to the enmity of both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”, and both of these kings are against The Theocracy, and those who are loyal and faithful to The Theocracy are pilgrims and strangers in the enemy’s country. The supporters of The Theocracy, therefore, must be entirely neutral as to all controversies between kings that rule under the demons’ influence. At the same time it is clearly the will of Jehovah that his covenant people now on the earth, and who are pictured by Daniel, should diligently seek to gain an understanding of the prophecy, and which understanding brings to them great comfort. This prophecy, supported by other scriptures, clearly points to the early collapse of demon-rule. Since the prophecy of Daniel, chapter eleven, beginning at verse twenty-seven, points to present-day events, the examination of the prophecy and its consideration are here undertaken.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>25</sup> “And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.” (Daniel 11:27) In 1914 Jehovah enthroned his King, Christ Jesus, and sent him forth to rule while the enemy still held on to his power. In A.D. 1914 “the king of the north” included Germany, Austria and Italy, with the Vatican riding on all of them as religious adviser and dictator; the so-called “Dreibund” at all times had the blessing of the pope. And in that same year, 1914, the British Empire set up a Protectorate over Egypt, and therefore represented the interest of Egypt and stood for “the king of the south”. The British Empire was supported by its ally, the United States of America. For a brief space Italy followed her father’s practice of deception and lined up with the British</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Empire, expecting to gain some benefit therefrom; but in 1922 Mussolini seized the power and again Italy returned to the fold of its father, the chief of demons, and became the ally of and associate with the Vatican. Mark this, that &quot;both of these kings’ claim to be Christian, that is, to follow Christ, but their hearts are exactly in the opposite direction, that is, their motive and purpose is bent on ruling in opposition to Christ, the King of The Theocracy. Hence, their course of action or claim is hypocritical and deceptive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> Their “hearts shall be to do mischief”. This part of the prophecy translated by Rotherham reads: “Their heart will be set on acting wickedly.” They are set on acting contrary to the Almighty God Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus; hence their course of action is wicked. While claiming to be Christian, if they ever were, they both have forgotten God. Their course of action ignores the Theocratic rule by Christ Jesus the King, and they act in defiance of Almighty God, devising their own wicked schemes for world domination. The schemes of these two kings clash with each other, and both are against The Theocratic Government. Those two “kings”, that is, “of the north” and “of the south”, do not look to Jehovah and his kingdom for which Christ Jesus had commanded all of his followers to pray, but each has his heart set on world control under demonism; and since the determination is to rule or ruin, those kings set about to destroy each other, so that ‘the nations are angry and God’s wrath is come’. (Rev. 11:18) They both prepare in advance for their destructive work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> “And they shall speak lies at one table.” Both of these kings resort to tactics of their father to cover up their real selfish purposes. Both practice diplomacy, which is usually deceptive, and which is particularly made manifest by the Axis powers in recent years. By that is meant that the Axis powers promise one thing and do the very opposite. But the chief lie in which both kings engage is this: By their course of action both deny that Jehovah God is the Supreme One, the Owner of the earth, and that He has appointed and anointed His beloved Son as the Ruler of the earth. Contrary to God’s purpose, both of these kings attempt to set up a rule of their own to control the earth, and both indulge in speaking falsehoods, claim to be Christian and yet denying God and Christ. They speak lies, of which their father the Devil is the past master and author. Looking back a few years before the World War, both of these kings were members of the Hague Court of International Arbitration and claimed to be, and presumably were, for peace. But they were not for the “peace of God”, most assuredly. As workers of lawlessness they “speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SEeWATCHTOWER,</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">is in their hearts”. (Ps. 28: 3) While claiming to be for peace, outwardly both were arming, and about the time of the coming of Christ Jesus both of these kings, under the direction of their father, the chief of demons, began a war with each other.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>28</sup> The prophecy identifies them -as “at one table”, where they sit and diplomatically speak flattering and peaceful words. They sit at what table? Certainly not the table of Jehovah; because all of His ways are truth and righteousness, and not even a “shadow of turning” from the truth is at his table. (Ps. 33: 4; Jas. 1:17) It must be, therefore, that both kings sit ‘at the table’, which table is provided because the Devil is the father of fraud, deception and lies, and both kings sitting at the table, as the prophecy declares, “speak lies.” No one can sit at Jehovah’s table and partake of the things thereof, and at the same time partake of the Devil’s provender. “Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.” (1 Cor. 10: 21) The Devil’s table is the table of demon religion, filled with nauseating provender. The clergy, who are the spiritual advisers, have become intoxicated on the Devil’s wine, and says Jehovah : “But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.”— Isa. 28:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>29</sup> Both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” have false notions as to the kingdom of God, and their blindness is due to the teachings of their spiritual advisers, the religious clergy. Both kings are sparring and fighting for a position of advantage concerning world domination. Both of such kings are bent on ruling the earth contrary to the purpose of Jehovah God, and are therefore in agreement on one thing, to wit, that they are both opposed to the witnesses of Jehovah who proclaim the name of the great Theocrat and of his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>30</sup> Furthermore, both of those kings think to “change times and laws” to suit their own convenience and schemes. (Dan. 7: 25) For some time prior to 1918 the Lord had caused his truth of and concerning his government of righteousness to be proclaimed throughout the realms of those two “kings”, making known that the Gentile times were about to end and that the time for the coming and setting up of The Theocratic Government under Christ was at hand. Both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” ignored that message and went on selfishly working at their own schemes to rule the world. While sitting at the same table and using words concerning the arbitration and settlement of all world disputes by the Hague Court, both were using all their means to prepare for a deadly conflict that the successful one might rule the earth as desired and contrary to God’s appointed way of rule. But how about the success of such schemes for world domination? Shall the same prosper? The prophecy gives the answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>51</sup> “It shall not prosper,” says Jehovah. The two opposing kings did not and can not thwart Jehovah’s purpose. When 1914 arrived Jehovah enthroned his King, Christ Jesus, and said to those opposing conspirators : “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill [the top of my capital organization] of Zion.” Then Jehovah gave fair warning to the two opposing kings in these words: “Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”—Ps. 2: 2-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>82</sup> The chief of demons was determined to continue his rule of the world in defiance of Almighty God. The “war in heaven” was then begun in which Satan, the chief of demons, and all of his demon-forces fought against Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, and his angels, with the result that all the demons were cast down to the earth. (Rev. 12:1-9) At the same time [A.D. 1914] Satan plunged the nations of the two opposing kings into a terrible war, the announced purpose of which was to determine which of the two kings should rule the earth. Neither side won a decisive victory in that war, but the war came to an end in 1918 and a makeshift of peace was brought forth. The Lord had cut short that earthly war to give opportunity for his servants to go about in the earth and ‘preach this gospel of the kingdom as a witness’, after which the final end shall come. (Matt. 24:14, 21) It was in 1918 that Christ Jesus, the great King and Judge, came to the temple for judgment and there separated the selfish ones who had covenanted to do God’s will from the unselfish and approved ones, and sent the latter forth as his servant to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. It was not then and is not now within the power of demons to stop the onward progress of Jehovah’s Kingdom. The scheme of the two kings for world dominion cannot prosper, and therefore, in the language of the prophet referring to demon schemes, “it shall not prosper.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>83</sup> “For yet the end shall be at the time appointed”; which means, of course, at the time appointed by Jehovah, and which must come exactly in his due time. “The time of the end,” therefore, had beginning in 1914, and nothing could change Jehovah’s purpose, and the final end of demons’ rule shall come exactly at the time which Jehovah has appointed. Satan’s uninterrupted rule came to an end in 1914, when Christ Jesus, the righteous, rightful King, was sent forth to rule. (Ps. 110:2) From 1914 onward until the final end there must be done chiefly the witness work to the name of Jehovah, and which is God’s “strange work”. (Isa. 28: 21) As to the final end, that is to say, the conclusion of “the time of the end”, Jehovah said to Daniel, and hence to the faithful ones on earth whom Daniel pictured: “Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation ; for at the time appointed the end shall be.” (Dan. 8:19) That positive and unchangeable declaration of Jehovah is that demon rule shall for ever cease exactly on time, which he has appointed, and his promise is that he will make his faithful servants to know what shall be concerning that time. During the period of “the time of the end”, that is, from and after 1914, Jehovah by Christ Jesus has been revealing to his faithful servants the meaning of various prophecies recorded in the Bible. It therefore appears that Jehovah’s due time is now here to make his people know more about the final end. With full faith in God and in Christ Jesus his King, the faithful servants of the Lord now diligently seek an understanding of prophecy, well knowing that the Devil’s scheme shall not prosper but shall end disastrously at the time God has appointed. The movements of the two kings opposing are described in the prophecy of Daniel, and it will be noted how the physical facts or events stated hereinafter fit the prophecy. “The king of the north” makes the next move, as verse twenty-eight shows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>84</sup> “Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.” (Dan. 11:28) Having in mind now who is the representative on earth of “the king of the north” note the following historical facts. Kaiser William II was enthroned June 15, 1888. He there headed the “Dreibund”, or triple alliance, which at this point in the prophecy stood for “the king of the north”. The kaiser quickly showed that he was in his father’s 'land”, having returned or moved into it, and that his motive was to gain riches and power. “Then shall he return into his land with great riches.” He did so; and he and the pope worked hand in hand. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font8"> notes some pertinent facts, to wit: “Bismarck’s [anti-Catholic] </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">leidturkampf</span><span class="font8"> legacy William sagaciously disposed of through concessions which he turned to profit by making an implicit alliance of the Vatican and the German schools in his anti-revolutionary policies and by remodeling the schools themselves. With all his alleged autocratic tendencies William undoubtedly sought the aggrandizement of Germany, her industrial and commercial supremacy, colonial expansion and primacy amongst the great powers. He extended the imperial influence to Turkey and Asia Minor, and strengthened German interests in the Far East and in Africa and South America.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana, </span><span class="font8">Volume 29, page-333.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">” Representing “the king of the north”, and hence heading the triple alliance, the kaiser sought to dominate the world. Was he acting in the interest of The Theocracy? or under the direction of demons? The prophecy answers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And his heart shall be against the holy covenant.” It is Christ Jesus who is in the “holy covenant” with Jehovah for The Theocratic Government, and into which covenant he invited his faithful apostles: “Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.”—Luke 22: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” That the kaiser was under demons’ influence and power is further shown by the fact that he often spoke of himself as “the instrument of the Lord”. Probably he did not recognize his lord, however, who is and was then Satan, the chief of demons, “the god of this world,” and who blinds the minds of men. (2 Cor. 4:3,4) The kaiser was blinded by the chief of demons concerning the truth and misled many people of the nations. The record of his reign and that of his allies plainly shows the purpose thereof was to dominate and rule the world contrary to The Theocracy by Christ Jesus. From the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font8"> some further pertinent facts are quoted: “Notwithstanding William’s general good conduct, his occasional outbursts of ambition, and his persistence in building up the army and navy, constantly aroused suspicions of his intentions. . . . With all his wonderful abilities for organization and domination William had a streak of indiscretion in many of his public utterances, and was frequently expressive of ideas appropriate to sovereigns of the Middle Ages. He was a firm believer in the divine right of kings and of kaisers in particular. On numerous occasions he spoke of himself as ‘the instrument of the Lord’, and took such excessive interest in the army, so often spoke of his confidence in it, and permitted and even fostered such arrogance in his officers, that the whole world came to recognize that the army ruled Germany and the kaiser ruled the army. . . . It is now generally conceded that almost from the first day of his reign he began to plan for world domination; that he dreamed of what Napoleon might have done had he been a little more shrewd and painstaking, and resolved that he, William, would show the world that one man could raise himself to the topmost pinnacle and not only rule Germany, but through Germany might rule the civilized earth.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>37</sup> Austria-Hungary was then and still is Roman Catholic and under the religion of the demon-con-trolled Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Papacy could be expected to take the course only of supporting the Triple Alliance and to oppose Protestant Britain and France and Russia, which formed the Triple Entente, which Entente also sought world dominion, seeking it in the name of Democracy, but in fact under the influence of the invisible demon rule. The Triple Entente was certainly not for The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, but sought world dominion contrary to Almighty God, Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>38</sup> The Triple Alliance then headed by Kaiser William claimed to be Christian, but that claim was and is far from the truth. Had they then or since been Christian that alliance would have supported The Theocracy by Christ Jesus. On the contrary, those composing “the king of the north” were against “the holy covenant”, and when the King, Christ Jesus, was enthroned in 1914 “the king of the north” had no ear for the message of Jehovah declared by his people throughout the earth. In Germany the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society maintained an organization, and in that land there was a wide witness to The Theocracy prior to 1914. But the German ruling powers wholly rejected that message. In that land the Photodrama of Creation was widely presented in the year 1914, in the early part of it proclaiming the fact that Armageddon was approaching; but that message was opposed by “the king of the north”. The prophecy further says:</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>58</sup> “And he shall do exploits, and return to his own land”; meaning “the king of the north” would return to “his own land”, which means the earthly condition with the ambition to the rule of demonism, headed by “the god of this world”. (1 John 5:19) All the exploits or acts of “the king of the north” were done in utter disregard of Jehovah’s Word, whereby it was made known that the Gentile Times had ended and the Kingdom, or The Theocracy, was at hand. “The king of the north” did not </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font8"> up to Zion, Jehovah’s organization, and submit to Jehovah’s King, the Rightful Ruler of the world, but, on the contrary, turned to his own land or organization under the demons that he might through his own ambition have world domination as the so-called “Holy Roman Empire” once had and ruled.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>40</sup> Faithful servants of the Lord, and hence sincere students of God’s Word, will pursue the remainder of Daniel’s prophecy with keenest interest and with real joy, because it seems clearly to be Jehovah’s time for them to have an understanding thereof.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY AT ST. LOUIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">(By </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">an interested observer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">U</span><span class="font6">NIVERSAL domination as the great issue before all creation was powerfully brought to the fore at the opening address of the president of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Society,</span><span class="font6"> to the Theocratic Assembly in St. Louis, Mo., August 6-10. Referring briefly to the prophetic drama in the Bible concerning patient Job and the severe test of his integrity toward God, the speaker said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The issue between Satan and Jehovah was not raised for the first time in Job’s day, but centuries before that time. The prophetic drama of Job discloses what Jehovah requires of all creatures who shall receive his boundless blessings. While the question for determination raised by the prophetic drama was and is, ‘Can Jehovah put men on earth who, under the most severe test, will prove faithful and true to God ?’ yet that great issue embraces much more. . . . Long before that time Satan had challenged the supremacy of Jehovah and raised the great issue. Many other scriptures support that conclusion. Satan’s accusing charge was made before the angels of heaven, and hence was known among the host of heaven, but not properly understandable and appreciated amongst men till the present time. God’s due time now appears when those on earth devoted to him are given an understanding of the real issue. The primary issue raised by Satan’s defiant challenge was and is that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Of UNIVERSAL DOMINATION.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To successfully hold the five-day Theocratic Assembly in St. Louis in the face of both contemptuous official indifference and bitter religious opposition of those who would now rule the earth in the place and stead of God’s Kingdom by Christ, this in itself was a triumphant answer to Satan’s challenge of Jehovah’s universal domination. It also proved to be a test of the integrity of Jehovah’s covenant people, but which was faithfully met by a multitude, 115,000 strong, to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was the opening day of the assembly at The Arena. Everything was now in readiness. The mammoth bowl of The Arena, with seats for 25,000, was now first opened to all, besides those having assigned duties there. At the southern end of the huge oval was the speakers’ platform, large and spacious, with purple and white drapings and with the platform railings all overlaid with shimmering gold. It was also bedecked with ferns and pink gladioli. Up above this, and thirteen feet above the Arena floor, was the orchestra pit, with a broad banner in front, having a background of brilliant red, upon which was the 1941 year-text, “Salvation to our God . . . and unto the Lamb.—Rev. 7:10,” all in letters of white bordered with glittering spangles of gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after 2 p.m. The Arena and the Hall “A” eastward and the Hall “B” westward were all filled, besides many on the lawns outside hoping to hear by the sound-cars and those at the trailer camp, a total attendance of 64,000. At three-thirty o’clock the assembly was brought to order at the playing of the song “The Glory of Jehovah” by an orchestra of 114 trained musicians, playing fourteen different types of instruments, stringed, woodwind and brass. Then a song by the united assembly, “Give Praise to Jehovah,” followed by prayer to the great Theocrat who made possible this greatest assembly of true ministers of Jehovah God ever on earth. After a brief address of welcome the convention chairman presented, amid tremendous applause, the first speaker on the program, who then addressed them on the subject “Integrity”. (Ps. 41:12) Never before this was the primary issue for determination made fully clear to God’s covenant people, to wit, universal domination. The test of Job’s integrity was only incidental thereto, just as the test of the integrity of those whom Job pictured is only related to that issue. The drama of Job was recorded in the Bible for the benefit of those today living who were foreshadowed by him, to wit, Jehovah’s anointed remnant of witnesses and their faithful earthly companions, the “other sheep”. Never before was it more necessary than in these days of rampant demonism for such to maintain their integrity toward God, even as Job maintained his for our example. The faithful prophets and witnesses of old maintained theirs, and are included in the class of innocent, blameless ones pictured by Job, and a brief record of them is given in Hebrews 11. God will resurrect them shortly in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The drama of Job is fulfilled at the end of the world, where we now are. The facts today completely fulfill Jesus’ prophecy at Matthew 24: 9 concerning the persecution of devoted Christians at the end of Satan’s world. Now God’s approved ones must hold fast their integrity and must fear the King of The Theocracy. We see the end is at hand! Satan has blinded man by religion. Religion has caused all nations to forget God. The demons, of which Satan is chief, are now fighting against The Theocracy and God’s remnant who announce it. Satan is wroth, knowing that the final battle to determine the issue of universal domination is at hand. “We must hold fast our integrity; and this, by God’s grace, we can do by refusing to compromise with any part of the demonized organization of the enemy. We must and will be entirely, wholly, unreservedly and completely devoted to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. We can have no part in and nothing in common with Satan’s organization. We are wholly and steadfastly for The Theocratic Government, and here, by God’s grace, we will remain. We know it shall vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring deliverance to all who love righteousness and who serve Jehovah under his righteous government ” (The full text of this address has now been published in the August 15 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> You will review it with profit.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visible audience responded warmly to this clear-cut exposition and loving exhortation with much applause. Such counsel and admonition were never better timed nor presented on a more suitable occasion. It was what God’s people needed, and the Lord provided it as “food convenient”. This speech was also radiocast by the Lord’s own station, WBBR, at Brooklyn, N.Y., to which the speech was carried by special wire, and it was heard by an eager invisible radio audience, many at a distance of more than 100 miles therefrom, including those faithful ones who had to stay behind “with the stuff” at Kingdom Farms, South Lansing, N. Y., who acknowledged the broadcast with a telegram to the St. Louis assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the close of the address the chairman announced a new issue of the popular paper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font6"> Number 9, and entitled “Victories in Your Defense—America’s Gain by the Fight”. After dismissal a copy was issued to each one on his way out, by the ushers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the day the registration of children between the ages of five and eighteen was in full swing in Hall “B”, west of The Arena. The multitude of children on the grounds was very noticeable. There were many of far less age present; yes, a number of mothers of unborn children came risking all in the earnest desire and effort to attend, and a number brought to light of day children, some on the grounds of the trailer camp, and which children it will henceforth be their obligation and privilege to “bring . . . up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord”. (Eph. 6:4) On the whole, the registered children were very orderly as they took part with their parents in the meeting, and paid good attention, and showed good fortitude during the summer heat wave and the great press of attendance. It called one’s mind back to when Jerusalem was threatened with assault by Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir, and all Israel assembled with King Jehoshaphat before the Lord at the temple at Jerusalem, they “with their little ones, their wives, and their children”. (2 Chron. 20:13) At St. Louis a few children got lost, for part of the day, reminding one how Jesus also became separated from his parents at the temple, for three days. (Luke 2:46) Like Jesus, these lost ones had not strayed frdm the Assembly precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A period of joyful songs and two discourses, one on “Zone and Regional Servants’ Duties” (of which servants all were at the Assembly and on duty), and another on “Day of Deliverance”, finished off a day in which Jehovah’s assembled people gratefully acknowledged that Jehovah had arranged this assembly and that he had rewarded their efforts in proceeding with the preparations for it and that on this very first and opening day he had answered their prayers beyond their expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THURSDAY, AUGUST 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today marked the stepping up of the tremendous advertising power of the Assembly for the Theocratic message as the legions of organized field workers rose from their night’s rest on lawns, park benches, camp grounds, floors or beds in private homes and hotels, and snatched breakfast at the cafeteria in Hall “A” or elsewhere, and swung into united action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day’s program began with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> gathering at 9 a.m at The Arena for Theocratic activities afield, opening with song, prayer and the day’s text and comment. Two forms of service were announced for this day: (1) during the morning a witnessing from home to home offering the literature, but also inquiring about rooms for the many thousands of new arrivals that had poured in through the night and others still due to arrive. For this work special combinations of literature were provided, all done up in neat packages, and now, too, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font6"> No 9 was available for every home; (2) information marching, with signs suspended from the shoulders announcing the president’s two public speeches, marching at 10 a.m.-l p.m. and 5:30-6.30 p.m. and 9 3010.30 p.m. Also volunteers were called for to put signs in all prominent windows of business places Added to these advertising mediums were, to wit, the lecture-announcement signs on the front of the city streetcars; the fine ad on the $1.25 Weekly Pass of the St. Louis Public Service Company used by passengers during the entire week of August 3-9 on all streetcars and buses, the signs displayed on all the motorcars and trailers of the conventloners (thousands of signs were stenciled on the sides of the cars free of charge at Hall “A”). All such constituted the most telling and impressive Theocratic advertising ever concentrated and displayed in any one area on earth. Besides which was the magazine work on the city sidewalks and from one business place to another, exhibiting and placing the August 1 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and the August 6 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font6"> both magazines containing articles on the St. Louis assembly and its outstanding features Due to all this unparalleled Kingdom publicity there was great public inquiry and comment. No high-priced ads at commercial rates in the worldly newspapers were needed. In the convenient time they had scorned their opportunity and privilege, and now their day has for ever passed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the public press further manifested its unworthiness by its misstatements on the assembly, by its lying and garbled report on the vitally important speech on “Integrity” by Judge Rutherford, and by its untrue personal slaps at the speaker. A swift and deserved retribution and judgment came: at five o’clock this evening there was released for circulation among the people of St. Louis the printed copy of what the speaker actually did say </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font6"> his speech. The August 15 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> contained the full text of the speech, and now thousands of copies of this issue were made available to magazine distributors to put out immediately. This unexpected chance to return the fire of the enemy thrilled God’s people, and forth they went with this new ammunition with boiling zeal, and shortly the entire supply of all magazines was exhausted. The pro-Catholic </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe Democrat</span><span class="font6"> of St Louis spoke of the speaker (a native Missourian) as a “tall, balding, wing-collared Californian”, much after the manner as when the prophet Elisha was on his way to Bethel and many religious youths came out and mocked, saying, “Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head!” and Elisha turned and uttered Jehovah’s judgment upon them and two she-bears from the forest came and ‘tore’ 42 of them. Doubtless by the time this assembly closed the public press felt it had been torn by the claws of something far worse than two literal bears and that a “curse” rested upon it for its stubborn course of willful, lying mockery against the Elisha work today and those doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Attendances at the sessions increased, as the assembly increased to 70,000 attendants, the number originally published as expected; and thousands more were yet en route to St. Louis. Much profit was derived from today hearing capable speakers deal with such subjects as “Magazine Route Work”, “Magazine Street Witnessing,” “Courage,” “Jael’s Experiences,” “Zone Assembly and Its Purpose,” and “Covenant Obligations”. These speeches stressed Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and its structure, and the work it is now commissioned to do, and the effective ways of getting the witness done; also the requirement to obey organization arrangements, and our obligations as consecrated Christians to fulfill our side of the covenant with Jehovah God as his faithful and true witnesses, if we would gain life and have part in the vmdication of his greatly reproached holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRIDAY, AUGUST 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was notably Pioneers’ Day. Due to Jehovah’s loving provision through his visible organization more than 5,000 pioneers from America and other lands were enabled to come and share the glorious Kingdom service at St. Louis. All registered as such on arrival, and the Society provided free meals for them and also rooming accommodations for as many as needed it This supports that the Society is in very truth a “charitable” organization even according to the definition of the worldly law. There was a booth in the Arena corridor marked “New Pioneers”, and up till this point 300 new pioneers had already signed up at this assembly, one being a seven-year-old. (Before the convention closed more than 700 had signed up.) The present pioneer band includes some men 86 years old and some women 77 years old, and some children nine years of age. ‘According to the faith of all such be it unto them,’ as Jesus said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 3 pm. all the pioneers had assembled in the main auditorium in front of the speakers’ platform, their identification cards admitting them. The rest of The Arena was all packed out again, by other publishers. Dwelling on the subject “Pioneer’s Place in the Organization” a speaker emphasized that “the time of independent isolation of the pioneers is past” and now they must faithfully co-operate also with the regional and zone servants and with the organized companies with which many are associated. Another speaker considered “Pioneer Requirements” and stressed the need for meeting the “hours” requirement to remain permanently in the work, and that the back-calls made by pioneers should be increased. In the United States only 6.5 percent of all publishers were pioneers, whereas in the British Isles 11 percent are such, and hence this country could well increase its percentage of pioneers. In this connection the speaker read a letter from a St. Louis radio announcer setting out the frank statement by a prominent religious lecturer from Britain concerning the stabilizing and heartening effect the fearless witness work of Jehovah’s witnesses has upon the morale of the British people during this war, and also concerning their faithfulness in concentration camps in Germany, to the dismay of the Nazis. (Incidentally, copies of this letter were thereafter released to the press for publication, but not a single newspaper dared print such favorable publicity concerning Jehovah’s servants.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Judge Rutherford greeted the pioneers. He expressed i( as a privilege to greet such fighters for The Theocracy, and that the activities of such a band as these must “make some of the ‘old woman' mighty sick”. Pioneering men fled from Europe to seek and establish here freedom of speech, of assembly and of worship of God; they never imagined that such freedom would ever be hampered here as it is today in this land. This is all traced to religion and its allies. When these have finally closed down on our work here and cry “Peace and safety<sup>1</sup>” then a mighty explosion will occur and blow off the lid. “You pioneers are in this witness work not for selfish aggrandizement, nor to make a name for yourselves, but for the Lord’s name’s sake.” Isaiah 62.10 includes a command for the pioneers: “Go through the gates!” The gates are open for all now, particularly the Lord’s “other sheep”. “Prepare ye the way of the people!” This it is your privilege to do by telling them the truth. “Cast up the highway!” That is, .to walk in the Lord’s way of righteousness. “Gather out the stones!” These are religion’s stumblingstones; gather them out by taking to the people God’s Word. “Lift up a standard for the people!” What standard! Not Hitler’s swastika! The flag of America is a dignified and beautiful symbol, whose real meaning is “freedom” and “rights” of free men. Demonized flag-wave: s try to force you to bow down thereto in violation of God’s law. Such ones are the first to violate the laws of the United States. “I say to the people of Missouri, where I have fought for the principles of democracy, because I believed them right. ‘Jehovah’s witnesses have the highest respect for what the flag represents, but, by God’s grace, they will not bow down to anything!”’ (Applause) You pioneers are real liberators of the people. When you go out from this convention you will have lots of scoffing, reproaches and ridicule, but not by honest men and women. Rejoice in tribulation. Don’t think you are the whole thing because you are a pioneer. Keep on encouraging those who love the Lord “Now get busy!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately following, the assembly chairman briefly reviewed the legal aspect, and the legal battles the enemy had thrust on God’s faithful witnesses, and that the Society had directed them to fight to the last ditch, and that at the greatest expense they had done so and gone up to the Supreme Court of the nation, and the Society was fighting for the things for which the flag stands, and now many legal victories had been won. In Germany hundreds of legal cases were won before the witness work was closed down there; likewise it may be here in America. Then a great outburst of gladness broke at the chairman’s announcement that Judge Rutherford had caused to be published a new 32-page booklet entitled “Jehovah’s Servants Defended”, setting out the judicial decisions of high courts in cases we had fought and won; he now authorized the release of the booklet and a copy to be given free to each one there. This gracious provision and gift put a new weapon in the hands of the battling witnesses for use in meeting the enemy both in the field and before the tribunals</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This same day a sharp judgment of the great Lawgiver against the “evil servant” class (Matt. 24:48-51) was expressed at the beginning of the afternoon’s sessions. An ex-army officer of the United States appeared on the platform and asked and was granted the privilege to present a Resolution concerning one Moyle. Said lawyer proved unfaithful to his position of trust in the Lord’s organization, slandered and abused the Bethel family at Brooklyn, quit his post of duty, and thereafter sued the Society and its board of directors and others for $100,000 for libel because the facts were published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> for the protection of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the land. The Resolution condemned such course of action and such recourse to worldly courts as unscriptural, unwarranted and unjustified. Put to a vote, the Resolution was adopted with a unanimous “Aye” by the vast assembly of more than 75,000. Thereafter copies of the Resolution were given free to all, to take home with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The afternoon’s program concluded with a stirring speech by one from Canada, where the ranking prelate of the greatest religious foreign power has dictatorially caused Jehovah’s own organization to be declared “illegal” and forbidden, and its adherents to be imprisoned; but where true Christians continue to obey God’s commands rather than man’s, and of whom 2,000 were then in attendance at the assembly and rejoicing. An example of a well-ordered Theocratic service meeting, presented by four young workers from headquarters, and a discourse on “Ehud and His Dagger” closed another blessed day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SATURDAY, AUGUST 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The event everywhere advertised for today and eagerly awaited was the delivery of the public address by the president on “Comfort All That Mourn”, at 3 p.m The great publicity campaign had gone over! Now 105,000 persons jammed The Arena and auxiliary buildings, the grounds all around, and the eleven-mile-distant trailer camp. A private telephone line connected .The Arena platform with the Watch Tower headquarters at Brooklyn and the administration building of radio station WBBR on Staten Island, N. Y., where other audiences assembled. Both when the speaker ascended the platform and when the chairman presented him to speak the audience gave him a great ovation. The orchestra, now augmented to 126 instruments, rendered a selection suitable to this significant hour. Then the speech began. The public-address system was working at its best, and everyone in every location could hear well. The speaker’s voice was in excellent condition, and filled with the quality of comfort. All hung on his words in rapt attention, only to break out in repeated applause, on nineteen occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Referring to the cause of mourning, the speaker stated: “It is the truth that will make the people free from fear and mourning. Receiving the truth, their joy at once begins, and that’s why 100,000 on these grounds today are all smiles!” (Applause) A reference to the “Axis Powers” and then to Daniel chapter eleven and “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” quickened the audience into unusual alertness. Both “kings” are npt men, but world ruling powers! Then the scales fell from the listeners’ eyes as Judge Rutherford identified the ‘northern king’ as the ruling power which is totalitarian and represented in the Axis combine and opposing Jehovah’s Theocracy and its servants; and the ‘southern king* as the world ruling power which rules and claims the right to rule the nations in the name of Democracy, and is represented in the British Commonwealth of Nations and supporting nations, but which also does not support The Theocratic Government. A brief survey of Daniel 11: 27-45 followed, and ended all too soon. But when he added, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">will publish the same, that the people of good-will may be enlightened,” there was a joyous expression of satisfaction. More applause, later, when he commented, on Daniel 11: 45, “that will mean the end of the Axis Powers, including Nazism, Fascism, and Romanism!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the good news of The Theocracy he exclaimed: “Thank God that the message does not proceed from any man!” (Applause) The fulfillment today of Daniel’s prophecy and its understanding mean the “end of the days” is here, and “which is proof that we may confidently expect Daniel the prophet of God to soon stand amongst the peoples on this earth and many will see him and rejoice”. (Applause) The audience thrilled again into applause when he added that the Lord’s people “are looking for those faithful men of God and they will not be surprised when they come”. He then proceeded to detail the blessings of God’s kingdom, and interrupted to cry out, “I challenge any government under the sun to point out any hope that they hold out!” (Applause) More blessings described, and he turned his words to his auditors: “And it is the duty and privilege of the people of this convention to tell the people of Missouri and of all parts of the land about The Theocracy.” (Applause) Next a glorious description of “the Holy City”; then “no more death!” (Rev. 21:1-4) As to our period of transition from the wicked to the Theocratic rule, “soon the combined elements of wickedness will put forth their supreme effort in their final endeavor to destroy all who support The Theocracy, and they will cry ‘Peace and safety!’ because they have all of Jehovah’s witnesses in the jug!” (Applause, with smiles of understanding) “They shall fail, and none shall help them, because God has decreed it so.” Then came words of hope concerning the Armageddon survivors, followed by a contrast between the wicked and the wise: “They that be wise will choose to serve the King of glory and receive the blessings of everlasting life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the words, “And now, my good friends, I am sure you will want to join in sending a message of comfort,” Judge Rutherford read a prepared “message”, addressed “To all persons of good-will toward Jehovah and His King, Christ Jesus”. Concluding it, he put the question, “If you believe that this is the message of loving-kindness that you wish to send to the people, say Aye!” There was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> unanimous “Aye!” seconded by great applause. During the speech Judge Rutherford appealed “to the people of my native state [Missouri] to calmly look into the Bible for the hope of eternal life” (Applause), and now he expressed it as a “great privilege to speak to the children of the people of this state”, and he asked: “What do world powers hold forth! Nothing! What does The Theocracy hold forth!” Everything worth-while!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The speech ended and Judge Rutherford retired, but a further joy awaited. Before the speech the chairman announced that, anticipating the great demand for it in print, the speech had been published and copies were on hand. Now it was announced that ten copies of the new booklet “Comfort All That Mourn” would be given free to each one there to distribute at once to the people of St. Louis, and without contribution; but any recipient so desiring and asking might contribute whatsoever he felt inclined. The response to this opportunity after such a public address was electrical, and parties and individuals scattered to all parts, the slums, the sidewalks fronting the “cockatrice hatchery” the Vatican maintains in St. Louis, and other locations convenient for the quick-distribution work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other presentations on the day’s program were “Advice for Kingdom Publishers” by the Society’s legal representative, and also discourses on “Transition” and on “Theocracy”, all which were received with much aid and benefit. The supply shipped of the new booklet “Comfort All That Mourn” was quickly exhausted and distributed far and wide, and thus comfort from above was spread to other hundreds of thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUNDAY, AUGUST 10, “CHILDREN’S DAY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On an occasion last spring Judge Rutherford stated at beadquarters in Brooklyn, “This is the day of the children.” Today at the assembly marked the time even as such. The full significance of what Almighty God here caused to come to pass on this day will only be realized later under His revelation. He knows the end from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early this morning, at seven-thirty o’clock, there was an assembly of the candidates to hear the discourse on “Baptism”, prior to their immersion; where 3,903 presented themselves therefor, of whom 1,357 were children, and out of almost “all nations, kindreds, people and tongues”. Pools had been contracted for in the adjacent amusement park and at the Colored institution downtown, whither available motorears quickly transported candidates. Never since Pentecost of A.D. 33 was there such a great number baptized at one time at one place, in symbol of their consecration to Jehovah through Christ Jesus to do the divine will. It took two hours to perform this act of faith and obedience, so great was the number of those presenting themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other discourses marked the early and the closing hours of the day, but the address which was advertised by all channels of information to take place at the morning hour of eleven o’clock was “Children of The </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g” The appeal of the subject was such that the tremendous throng that turned out increased today to 115,000, exceeding all estimates. Today the Lord’s hand wrought more marvelously among the assembly than even yesterday, and those listening m by private wire at New York pomts must have tingled at what they heard and perceived taking place. For the fourth time The Arena was overflowing. This time, however, in the main arena directly m front of and in the box seats all round about the speakers’ platform was assembled an extraordinary audience, all children between the ages of 5 and 18 years, unattended by their parents. When Judge Rutherford strode to the front of the platform he beamed at the sight. Said the chairman by way of introduction, “You have come to hear a man who loves God’s Kingdom tell you about ‘Children of The King’—Judge Rutherford.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The speaker then began in a calm, clear voice, as of a father quietly instructing his own children at home in obedience to the divine command. Early he described the Paternal Government of Christ Jesus, “The everlasting Father,” when “there shall be no more religionists, no more politicians, no more commercial gangsters”. (Applause) The enemy shall be pushed out: “let the gangsters take notice now and begin to move!” (Applause) Those surviving Armageddon were pictured by Noah’s sons surviving the Flood, and they may never die. “That’s the hope of you children.” (Applause) Now the children are telling forth the Kingdom message, but “the religionists with their long robes and greased hair and lace-curtain skirts try to make you keep still”. (Applause) Such religionists are the ones ‘who have been the defamers of God’s name, but his faithful witnesses have continued on, regardless of such religionists’. (Applause) “They will go down m defeat, biting the dust as they go.” (Applause) “Probably some of you are listening in. [Applause] Stop kissing the toe of a man, and kiss the toe of the King. [Applause] Quit making jackasses of yourselves and dress yourselves like men. [Applause] Christ’s kingdom is marching to complete victory, and let all of them take notice today. [Applause] The Lord says the fear of man leads into a snare, and they are already in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judgment of the nations is now on, and the Lord is separating the “sheep” from the “goats”, “those billy goats that smell loud.” (Applause) The “sheep” will inherit on earth the blessings of the Kingdom. They will have dominion over the animals as Adam first had it, “and it will be nice for these birds and animals to become friends of you children.” (Applause) Ezekiel 34:25 describes the safety then, so that they “shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods”; “and some of them are learning it here now” (meaning those unable to find rooms or those at the trailer camp). (Applause) They shall be children of the King, and he will be their King-Father. The earth belongs to Him by right of purchase, and they will hold it in trust as his children-subjects and have part in beautifying it. Then the divine mandate shall be carried out, to fill the earth with a righteous, perfect offspring, and this by marriage and childbearing. “Some of these desecrators of His name claim that they only have the right to say who shall get married”; but they are presumptuous. In the Kingdom the “great multitude” will look to the Lord to guide as to selecting each a mate for himself. “Why, then, should a man who has the prospect before him of being of the great multitude now tie himself up to a stack of bones and a hank of hair!” (Applause)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then timely words were addressed to the parents of the children, especially any who “send your children to those devilish movies to learn all the wicked things. Keep them at home and teach them the truth. The child that is encouraged by its parent to spend time in those movies that adulate religion does not show any real love for his own child”. Parents should “teach their children concerning The Theocracy. In this do not fail!” The children should keep always in mind Ephesians 6 1- “Children, obey your parents in the Lord.” “If your parents are not devoted to the Lord, then you had better get somebody else to instruct you.” (Applause) “You may soon meet Abraham, Daniel and other faithful men of old who shall be here as perfect men.” (Applause) Matthew 8:11 says: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” To “sit with them does not mean to be inactive, but to rest m complete confidence with them, knowing that they are right and, being with them, you are walking in the way of righteousness”. Hear the command of the Lord written in the Bible at Revelation 22:11 to “Come!” “Come where! Come and take your stand firmly on the side of The Theocratic Government, if you would live.” (Applause) The world to come is described at 1 Peter 3:13 as a new heaven and earth. Those resurrected faithful men of old, in the visible rule as princes, will be the “new earth”, and “these princes are due now any day'” (Applause) All the nations are now afflicted with war, famine, pestilence, sickness, death, and religion, but under The Theocratic Government “the people shall work together exactly as you see upon these grounds”. (Applause) Then Psalm 148- 10-14 was finally quoted as a grand climax, biddmg all that live, beasts and fowl, kings (Christ and his church), and princes and all judges of the earth, both young men and maidens, old men (Armageddon survivors), and children (born of the great multitude), to praise the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The speech concluded, Judge Rutherford fixed attention directly on the children before him, commenting that “consecration is an individual matter; no one can consecrate for you A question is about to be propounded to each one of you All of you . . . children who have agreed to do the will of God and have taken your stand on the side of his Theocratic Government by Chnst Jesus and who have agreed to obey God and his King, please stand up.” (The children before him arose as one body ) “Behold, more than 15,000 new witnesses to the Kingdom'” (Applause) “All of you who will do what you can to tell others about God’s kingdom and its attending blessings, please say Aye ” (Cry, “Aye!”) (Applause) “If you bad an instrument in your hands that you could use to the honor of Jehovah and learn of his kingdom, would you use it!” (A unanimous “Yes!”) “Then be seated, and I will tell you about it. . . . The Lord has made possible the preparation of this book as a message for you [holding up the new book]. [Great, prolonged applause] The title of this book is ‘Children’. [Applause] There are registered at this convention, and I see before me, more than 15,000 children between the ages of five and eighteen. All of those children have stood up and have likewise signified their devotion to The Theocracy. Thank God that I have come to this day when it is my privilege to speak to such an army of young men and women taking their stand on the side of Jehovah! When they try to silence you, the Lord will put his hand over you and see to it that they do not silence you Millions of persons of good-will to this hour desire to know the truth, but the long-skirted, lace-curtamed religionists will try to keep them in the dark.” The book called “Children” will do a work of enlightening them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the faithful ones of old who shall be resurrected Judge Rutherford commented: “Soon you will see Barak and Deborah (I got a picture of her in this book), and when you see her you will love her very much. She is a real woman, and will be able to give you girls proper advice, yon girls who are looking for a husband. When you see Daniel, David, Moses and all the prophets, listen to what they have to say, and they will properly advise you boys and girls. I am going to have handed to every one of you 15,000 children one of these books as a gracious gift. I ask that you first study it faithfully. Ask someone else to sit with you under the shade of a tree and study that which leads to life and endless blessings. ... It is your privilege between now and before the day school opens to spend six hours a day in taking the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> to others.” The parents should encourage their children to do this very thing, if they would have them live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cartons of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> that had been deposited in The Arena were now opened, and Judge Rutherford instructed the children how to come and each get a copy thereof, those in the rear half of The Arena marching in two columns out through a side exit, and those in the front half of The Arena marching up over the platform and out through a rear exit. As the march began, the orchestra (minus all its children instrumentalists) struck up and rendered songs, “Children of the Heavenly King,” “The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon,” and “Who Is on the Lord’s Side!” while the vast audience sang. Never was there a more moving sight in these “last days”. Many, including strong men, wept at the demonstration. Receiving the gift, the marching children clasped it to them, not a toy or plaything for idle pleasure, but the Lord’s provided instrument for most effective work in the remaining months before Armageddon. W'hat a gift! and to so many! The manner of releasing the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> was an outright surprise to all, but the almighty hand of the All-wise One, Jehovah, was in it, and the maneuver was most blessed indeed. Thereafter </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font6"> the author’s edition, was disposed of to adult conventioners, on a contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blessings of the Assembly were further enhanced by the afternoon session, which provided a delightful anticlimax to “Children’s Day”. The Arena was agam packed out to hear about “Your New Work” and the president’s parting words. For weeks the question had been upon many consecrated minds, and at 3 p.m. the first speaker, the factory and office servant at Brooklyn, disclosed the “new work”, to wit, the placing of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children, </span><span class="font6">and thereafter, over a period of three weeks, sending each obtain-er, at no extra cost to him, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Children</span><span class="font6"> Study Course”, to wit, three attractive, illuminated question-and-answer folders, these to be followed the fourth week by a back-call service by the one placing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font6"> Another speaker, on “Solving the Problem”, showed how the new book, together with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Children</span><span class="font6"> Study Course”, provided the solution for the problem of company publishers to reach their individual quota of twelve back-calls monthly and one model study weekly, as suggested in the recent communication of the president of the Society. Three speakers then spoke, each briefly on “When to Begin”, and were in concert as to the answer, that now is the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When, next, Judge Rutherford came on the platform, he talked extemporaneously, but the unspeakable blessing the Lord bestowed in the morning appeared to have put him in the best of condition and filled his heart and mouth full of words “in season” and “fitly spoken”. For forty-five minutes the audience spent a most delightful time listening. Said Judge Rutherford: “It is not exactly a new work, but it is putting on a little more steam for the final roundup.” Then concerning the book just released, he added: “We had on the grounds this morning only 40,000 of the autographed edition. . . . But I am glad to tell you that, while that 40,900 are gone, there is another 150,000 copies on the grounds ready for use. [Applause] So you will have 150,000 on the grounds here to start with now, and I think it might be well for two or three thousand first-class workers to go into the St. Louis field and get those in the hands of the people here who want to know something about it before you go away.” (It developed that more than 3,000 persons of good-will turned in their names at the public meetings, requesting calls by Jehovah’s witnesses and further information.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then in most interesting fashion he told of his visit to the trailer camp Saturday, and also of the opposition and the difficulties caused by the public service bodies, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Convention Bureau, all due to their subservience to the religious organization, whom he symbolized under the figure of one distressed “Fayther O'Hooligan”. The description of the actions and the bossy orders of this “Fayther O’Hooh-gan” in his own brogue to local businessmen and Catholic population caused great amusement, and the assembly laughed again and again. (Pss. 2:4; 37:12,13; 52: 6) Then he told of the good people of St. Louis and showed how the parable of the “sheep” and “goats” had thus had local fulfillment.—Matthew 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The city editor of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Globe Democrat</span><span class="font6"> sent him a question. “Do you not think it discourteous to criticize another person’s religion in his own community!” but, due to “Father O’Hooligan”, they refused to publish the answer submitted, though it was of great public interest. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy in America have treated in like manner all proposals, challenges and petitions to public discussion in debate over radio. They have all been warned, and now “we are going to spend our energy and time and strength in going to the people of good-will toward God and his Theocratic kingdom, carrying to them the message”. Hope-rousing and stirring was his statement: “I feel absolutely certain that from henceforth . . . those who will form the great multitude will grow by leaps and bounds.” The arising of 15,000 children this morning was a decisive answer and reproof to the “evil servant&quot; class who say, “Humph! where’s the great multitude!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For ever to disprove all published false charges and slurs that he is the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses, he said: “I want to let any strangers here know what you think about a man being your leader, so they won’t be forgetting. Every time something rises up and starts to grow, they say there is some man a leader who has a great following. If there is any person in this audience who thinks that I, this man standing here, is the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses, say Yes.” But there was a unanimous “No”! emphatically. “If you who are here believe that I am just one of the servants of the Lord, and we are working shoulder to shoulder in unity, serving God and serving Christ, say Yes.” The unanimous “Yes!” was strong and unequivocal. “Well, you don't have to need me as an earthly leader to get a crowd like that to work ” He now asked them to return to their respective parts and “put on more steam . . put in all the time you can” Then he offered words of benediction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Briefly referring to the coming convention in Britain in September he asked them to join with him in a cablegram, as follows: “To the Leicester Assembly: Your fellow servants, assembled 115,000 strong at St. Louis, bid our British brethren be very courageous and hold fast your integrity. Theocratic victory is certain. [Signed] Jehovah’s witnesses in America.” This was adopted with a unanimous “Aye”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His final words were, “Well, my dear brethren, the Lord bless you. Now I won’t say Good-bye, because I expect to see you at some time again.” By this the brethren were greatly encouraged, and their hearts and minds were turned to the still greater and grander event, “the general assembly” spoken of at Hebrews 12: 23. Till then they would keep covenant and maintain integrity toward Jehovah God, and endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ, and continue on in God’s “strange work” as his faithful and true witnesses, till done.</span></p>

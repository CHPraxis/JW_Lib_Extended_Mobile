<p><span class="font3">The midsummer Testimony Period, as above named, will include all of August The Lord now having turned to his devoted people the “pure language” of the truth of The Theocracy, it will be their privilege during August to publish the same with a “pure lip”, that a multitude of others may hear and turn from religion and join in the united service of Jehovah. Therefore during this Testimony Period the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> together with the latest published booklet will be placed with everyone possible, on a contribution of 25c.

A good report is awaited from each and all at the close of August, marking the special blessing of the Lord upon all that “serve him with one consent”.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark17"></a>THE WISE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.”—Prov. 15:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH has made plain his purpose to permit men to choose the way of life or choose the way of death. Having created Adam, God placed before him the way of life and the way of death. God informed man that he must obey if he would live, but if he should choose to disobey he must die. (Gen. 2: 17) If Adam had always looked to God and obeyed his law he would not have died. Adam chose the opposite course, with the result that he died and all other of humankind came under condemnation by inheritance. Therefore all the race in due time must die, and all do die and remain dead except those who choose the way of life and conform to the rules which God has laid down, pointing out the course that they must take.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> For his name’s sake Jehovah set before the Israelites the way which that people must </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> if they would live; that is, he set before them life and death and gave them the opportunity to choose. To that covenant people he said: “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.” —Deut. 30: 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> After Joshua had led the Israelites into Canaan, and after by the grace and power of Almighty God he had gained many victories over the enemy, and even though God had marvelously shown his favor toward the Israelites under Joshua, yet many of them were disposed to go after demon religion. Time and again they had been warned, and now Joshua had about finished his course and under the direction of the Lord he stood before the Israelites and pronounced the admonition to make their choice whom they would serve. At the same time Joshua declared his purpose of making a wise choice. “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Josh. 24:15) Therefore God’s Word, emphatically stated at Proverbs 15:24, informs man that in order for him to escape death, described in that text as “hell”, which is the grave, he must look above. That means that he must look to Jehovah for guidance in the way of life if he would become wise in God’s way. The wise man will look to God and continue to seek instruction from him: “Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.”—Jas. 3:13,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">‘From Abel to John the prophet, the forerunner of Christ Jesus, there were a few men who became wise and pursued a wise course. In due time Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to the people of Israel to deliver to them His message of truth by which they could become wise and find the way of everlasting life. This God did for them after they had repeatedly pursued a course of foolishness. For more than three years Jesus confined his teachings to the Jews, instructing them in the right way, but only a small number of them chose the wise way. When he had completed the work which Jehovah assigned him to perform exclusively amongst the Jews, Jesus made this announcement, which is addressed to all persons who desire to choose the wise way: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17 : 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’For the past 1900 years approximately God through Christ Jesus has caused the good news of and concerning The Theocracy and the means of salvation for man to be proclaimed throughout the earth. Of the many millions who have heard that message only a small number have chosen the course of wisdom, and this in the face of the fact that God’s Word frequently admonishes men to consider the great importance of taking the wise course: “Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.”—Prov. 8:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• Within those 1900 years God has taken out from the nations of earth a people for his name, which people shall become a part of his Theocratic Government. God limited the number of those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus in His government. Each one of these chosen ones must take the wise course and continually and faithfully walk therein even unto death. It appears that the greater number of those who have taken the wise course, and have been taken out by Jehovah for his name, have finished their earthly course and that only the remnant now remain on earth; and to such remaining ones God has assigned the duty and privilege of bearing testimony to his name and to his kingdom, which they must do until his due time to exercise his supreme power against the adversary and the adversary’s entire organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The due time is now present when the Lord is gathering to himself his “other sheep”; and those thus gathered, and who prove faithful and maintain their integrity toward God and his King, shall in due time form the “great multitude” that will live forever on the earth by the grace of God and will be permitted to carry out God’s purpose. Unlike those sheep who compose the “little flock”, the “great multitude” is not limited as to number. Jehovah God is now doing his “strange work”. He is exposing the fallacy and hypocrisy of religion and setting before the world his message of truth, which plainly announces the way of life. This message is not limited to a few, but all who will hear are given the opportunity. The Lord Jesus, at the direction of Jehovah, now says to the people of good-will now on earth: 'Let him that hear-eth, . . . and whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely.’—Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Who will hear, give heed, understand, and choose the way of life </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s answer is: “The wise shall understand.” God’s Word shows that there are two classes of people now on the earth, to wit: those who will be wise and shall find the way to righteousness and life, and the other class, which continues in wickedness, darkness and religion, and remains under condemnation and suffers eternal death. The present is “the time of the end”, that is, the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule; and such is the due time for those who are wise to understand the purpose of Jehovah and take the course that leads to life everlasting. Daniel, the faithful prophet of God, heard and uttered the prophetic message of Jehovah, but he did not understand, for the reason, it was not then God’s due time for man to understand. Mark these words of Daniel in respect thereto, and the response to him from Jehovah: “And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, 0 my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.”—Dan. 12: 8-10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Now is the due time when those who shall form the “great multitude” must hear and choose wisely, and will understand. For this reason the Lord is causing the message of The Theocracy to be sounded in the earth. The demons, under the leadership of their chief Satan, know that the crucial hour is here; hence all the wicked of the spirit and human creatures desperately fight against the witnesses of the Lord. They hate Jehovah and his Theocratic Government, and hate those who announce it. But the remnant, together with their companions who have fled to the Lord for safety and protection, must continuously proclaim the message regardless of all opposition, and which, by the grace of God, they will do. As others of good-will hear and choose the wise way they too will join in the proclamation of the kingdom of God under Christ as the only hope of human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BLINQ GUIDES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The teachers of Israel were the learned men of that people. They were made up of the Pharisees, priests, and doctors of the law. They instructed the people in the way that they should go, but, although to them had been committed by the Lord the duty and obligation of reading and explaining the law of God to the people, those self-constituted wise men taught the traditions of men. When God sent his beloved Son to them they fought against him because he told them the truth. To such Jesus said, “Ye fools and blind”; which words, without a doubt, meant that by their course of action they had ignored God and in their heart said, “There is no God,” and had become blind as to his purpose. Further addressing them Jesus said: “Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”—Matt. 23: 24, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> To his faithful disciples Jesus said concerning those blind religionists and scientists: “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” —Matt. 15:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ Those teachers in Israel thought they were wise, but their wisdom was not from above. They had neglected to look above for instruction, and failed to follow the instructions from the Lord. Those were perilous days for the Jews, and all of the blind did fall into the ditch, as the Lord Jesus foretold.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The present is the time of even greater peril. (2 Tim. 3:1) Today the schools, colleges and universities instruct the students in what is called “the science of evolution”, which teaching emphatically denies Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and completely pushes aside and shuns the Bible. Concerning such instruction the Word of God says: ‘Avoid profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called.’—1 Tim. 6: 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> At the present time pastors and clergymen, who claim to represent God and Christ, have little if anything to say about the Bible. The great majority of them teach for doctrines the traditions of men and will not hear and ‘endure sound doctrines’, which are set forth in the Bible. They ignore the Scriptures and oppose the kingdom of God and deny the blood of Christ Jesus as the purchase price of mankind. Desiring the approval of men rather than God’s approval, they turn to fables. They too are blind guides of the people, yet they regard themselves as wise, and their dupes that follow them likewise regard them as wise. But they are wise according to worldly wisdom. The Lord’s Word foretold this from above, and now we see it about us: “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” (2 Tim. 4: 3,4) Those who desire to live must ignore such teachers and receive the instruction set forth in the Word of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WAY TO LIFE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> They that be wise look up to Almighty God, who is above, and pray him to guide them into the way of life everlasting: “For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light. 0 continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.”—Ps. 36: 9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> The same rule must apply to everyone who shall have any hope of life. The “other sheep” of the Lord now recognize that the words of Jehovah, uttered by God’s prophet, apply to Israel and at the same time and with stronger force now apply to those of “Christendom” who profess to be for God, and who are not, to wit: “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.” (Jer. 2:13) “0 Lord, the Hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.” (Jer. 17:13) That which is today called “Christendom” is the antitype of the Israelites. Both have turned to religion; both have forsaken the fountain of living waters, and drink at the fountains of so-called “wise men”, who teach tradition, and which waters not only are brackish but contain the poison that leads to death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The wise man takes the Bible for his guide because it is the only thing that illuminates his pathway. (Ps. 119:105) He hears and believes the words uttered by the Lord Jesus, to wit: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Thus it is announced that to know God and Christ is the way to life. Knowledge of God and Christ is absolutely essential to all who would be wise; and that knowledge is to be found in the Word of God alone. Receiving such knowledge the wise will be diligent to give heed thereto and walk in the way God leads. “He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.” (Prov. 10:17) “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.”—Prov. 12:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> It is a grievous mistake for one to conclude that he may walk in the way of righteousness without first receiving some knowledge of God and of Christ. The way that God has provided is strait, or narrow, because it is the righteous way: “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.”—Matt. 7:13,14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO BEGIN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> Every intelligent creature obtains information either from others or by his own observation of the things that are about him. The visible things of creation impart information to man. The mountains, the rivers, the trees, and divers like things of the earth, inform man that these things come from some greater power. The stars and the planets bespeak a power back of them that is far greater than they. This information which man gets from observation he knows is true, because he sees it with his own eyes; and therefore he has knowledge of the existence of the same. “Knowledge” means to receive and perceive the truth. From the information and knowledge which the man has he knows that there must be a power greater than himself, and a power greater than the things that he sees about him. That greater power is the Creator, the Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” who is invisible to the creature, and “whom no man hath seen nor can see”. (Ps. 83:18; 1 Tim. 6:16) The man who desires to know the truth recognizes that there must be an invisible power far greater than man. The same man desires to live. He hears then the words uttered by Jesus, the only great man that ever was on the earth, to wit: ‘This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’ He discerns that he must have a knowledge of the truth concerning the Creator as far as such information is revealed. How does he begin to obtain such true knowledge? The Scriptures answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.”—Prov. 1: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The Lord, the Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, is the Creator. The same man perceives the truth that the great Creator is One in whom resides all power over life, and therefore he fears to take any course contrary to the will of the Almighty God, who gives life. He having such proper fear, that marks the beginning of knowledge of the truth with that man. Where does he go to obtain more knowledge of the truth concerning Jehovah? Jesus answers : “Thy word [which is expressed in the Bible] is [the] truth.”—John 17 :17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The man who sincerely desires to be wise desires to take and does take the proper course. Fearing God, and fearing to go in the wrong way if he follows his own inclinations, that man seeks to learn what is the will of God concerning him, and he goes to the Word of God, which is the Bible, to find out. It is his genuine fear of Almighty God that starts him in the way of wisdom: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.”—Prov. 9:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The course of the wise, therefore, is progressive in this manner: First he obtains information and knowledge; and applying that knowledge properly, he chooses to be guided by the Word of God. The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, and also the beginning of wisdom with him; and being guided by God’s Word, he begins to have an appreciation of his own relationship to the Almighty God. He sees that Jehovah, the Almighty God, is all-powerful and all-wise, that justice is the foundation of his throne, and that “God is love”, meaning, that he is wholly unselfish. The man sees that he is wholly dependent upon the great, eternal God; and rendering himself in obedience to God, he is assured of God’s blessing. Now he is getting some understanding, that is, beginning to have a proper appreciation of his own relationship to the great Creator. “Understanding” means that the creature has an appreciation of his own relationship to the Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> When one starts in the right way, which is the way of wisdom, if he really desires to be wise-he will continue to grow in knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the wise man always fears God. He will not content himself by starting to serve God, and then become indifferent. Some persons conclude that, they having taken the step of consecration and agreement to serve God, nothing further is needful. That is a very erroneous position to take. The wise man continuously searches the Bible and carefully and prayerfully meditates upon and studies it that he may keep in the way that leads to life everlasting. This instruction is given to all who will walk in wisdom: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”—2 Tim. 2: 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> If one follows this admonition he gains understanding. He must walk in the way of wisdom in order to gain understanding. “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.” (Prov. 4:7) In no other way can man have a proper appreciation of his own relationship to the almighty Creator. Therefore, with all his getting he is admonished to get understanding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> To the one who thus turns his steps to the Lord, and agrees to do God’s will, sincerely desiring to go in the way of wisdom and righteousness, the Almighty God addresses these words: “My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: to deliver thee from the way of the evil man. from the man that speaketh froward things; who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness.”—Prov 2:1-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> The wise man knows that the will of God is perfect and if he would continue to walk in wisdom and to increase in understanding he must learn the will of God concerning himself and then he must strive to do God’s will. The wise man therefore turns to Jesus, the perfect One, who is also above, and looks up to him that he may learn by studying the course which Jesus takes. He hears the words of Jesus, which say: “I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8; Heb. 10:7) He immediately sees the necessity of his own acknowledgment of God and his agreement to do His will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The wise man quickly learns that he is a sinner because he was born such. (Rom. 5:12) He learns that Jehovah God is the fountain of life. (Ps. 36:9) He desires to enter life, and now he must find that way. And how shall he go about doing so! The answer is found in the words of Jesus: “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”—John 14:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah God is the fountain of life, which life he gives to those who obey him, and his provision is that life shall be administered unto the obedient of mankind by and through Christ Jesus, who purchased the human race with his own precious blood. Therefore man can come to God only by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ as his Redeemer and Savior. (John 3:16) To “believe” means to take a course in harmony with that mental conception; hence the wise man consecrates himself to God and Christ Jesus, and does so by solemnly agreeing to do the will of God, and so thereafter he can say, “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Though man is born in sin, and hence a sinner by inheritance, he learns from God’s Word that, if he has and exercises faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as his Redeemer and then fully consecrates himself to do the will of God, then God will teach him the right way; and so he finds this information in God’s Word, to wit: “Shew me thy ways, 0 Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. Good and upright is the Lord : therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. What man is he that feareth the Lord! him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.”—Ps. 25:4, 5, 8-10,12,13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Not only does the wise man desire the will of God to be done in him at all times, but his prayer to God is, “Make me do thy will.” This he can do because he knows that the way of Jehovah God is right and if God makes him do His will he will go in the right way: “For thou art great, and doest wondrous things; thou art God alone. Teach me thy way, 0 Lord ; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. I will praise thee, 0 Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name for evermore.”—Ps. 86:10-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EVOLUTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Is the university professor, who teaches the doctrine of evolution, a wise man? He is not truly wise. No doubt he is wise in his own conceits and wise in the eyes of his fellow worldly men; but not in God’s way. The doctrine of evolution denies the existence of Almighty God, the Creator; and he who teaches that man is a creature of evolution, who can and will gradually evolve into a greater creature, is woefully deceiving himself. In the sight of God that man is a fool, which is the very opposite of a wise one. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt; they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good.”—Ps. 14:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> He does not need to say to others, “There is no God,” but by his very course of action, and by teaching doctrines contrary to the Word of God, he testifies that he does not believe in the existence of the Almighty Jehovah; and therefore Jehovah says, ‘That man is a fool.’ The theory of evolution leads to death. All human creatures are born sinners, and must die unless redeemed by the blood of Christ Jesus. Evolution does not teach one to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Evolutionists are those who teach others not to believe in God and in Christ. Concerning these the Scriptures are explicit: “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John 3: 35, 36) A wise man shuns “evolution”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VAIN BABBLINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Does religion hold anything of hope for mankind ? Nothing whatsoever, but, on the contrary, religion is against God and leads to destruction. There are hundreds of religions taught by men and practiced by many, all of which are contrary to the Word of God. The religious teacher selects a scripture text upon which he is supposed to base his sermon and then he immediately departs from that text and devotes his speech to things pertaining to men, whom he calls “great”, and to politics of this world, and to such things as “individual development”. In all of these things he ignores the Word of God. The religionists teach the “inherent immortality of man”, which denies the Bible statement of man’s creation and makes God a liar. The same denies also the ransom sacrifice and the resurrection of the dead. Concerning all such, he who is wise will give heed to and follow the instruction given to him in God’s Word, to wit: “But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness: and their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymemeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” (2 Tim. 2:16-19) The babblings in which the religious teachers indulge are vain, and hence lead men away from the path of truth and life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> Without faith it is impossible to please God. (Heb. 11:6) Religious teachers have no faith in God and in his Word. Such teachers advance their own learning and human wisdom in the place and stead of God’s Word, and concerning them the Scriptures say: “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”—1 Cor. 1: 20, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>S5</sup> The way of life is by faith in God and in Christ Jesus. Faith must be based upon knowledge, which knowledge proceeds from a truthful source. The opinions and doctrines of imperfect men concerning the way of life have no truthful source. True knowledge comes only from the Word of God. Faith comes by hearing and by relying upon the Word of God. (Rom. 10:17) He that advocates or preaches any doctrine that is contrary to the Word of God is without faith. Teaching and following traditions of men make the Word of God of none effect toward men; hence the wise man shuns religion as a deadly thing. (Matt. 15:6-9) When he is asked to hear the babblings of religious teachers he immediately recognizes that such are vain and he quickly turns away from them and shuns them. He will not permit his mind to be filled with things that destroy faith in God and in his Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SHUN EVIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> “Evil” is that which brings injury to the one who suffers it. False doctrine, based upon the traditions of men, leads men away from life, and is therefore evil. Those who are wise will shun evil and give their attention and devotion to God and his Word. “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.”—Ps. 34:11-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> Today the Lord is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, that is, those who love righteousness and who hate evil. To such this instruction comes from God’s Word, and is given to such sincere ones: “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.” (1 Pet. 3:10,11) That rule applies both to the remnant and to the “other sheep” of the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BASIS OF HOPE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> All creatures who deny the lifeblood of Christ Jesus as the purchase price for humankind have no hope of life. Such are without God and Christ and without hope in the world. Life is the gift of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus. (Rom. 6: 23) There is no other way whereby man can be saved. (Acts 4:12) Christ Jesus, by the willing sacrifice of himself according to the will of God, provided the price and paid it over as the purchase price for mankind who will render themselves in obedience to God’s law. There is no other basis for hope of life. They being born in sin and shapen in iniquity, the only means of escaping eternal death is by faith in God and in Christ and then by full obedience to God’s law. Evolutionists and religionists boast of their wealth and wisdom, according to this world, but that cannot provide salvation for themselves or anyone else; as it is written: “They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever;) that he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.” —Ps. 49: 6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Religionists, evolutionists, professors, great politicians, and men of fabulous material wealth disregard God’s Word and expect to find some special place provided for them whereby they may be favored above others. In this they are doomed to certain disappointment. The rich and worldly-wise are catered to by the religious leaders, and all such are honored in the sight of and by other men and are commended because of their apparent greatness. God says of such: “For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Though, while he lived, he blessed his soul; and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. Man that is in honour, and under-standeth not, is like the beasts that perish.”—Ps. 49:17-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> God in his loving-kindness, and for his own name’s sake, has made provision for faithful and obedient men to live, and that provision is by and through Christ Jesus. This he has made plain in the following words: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever be-lieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:16,17, 35, 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> If one does not believe that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that Christ Jesus is the Redeemer of obedient men, then there is no hope for him to have life everlasting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Redemption is not for every man whether that man believes or does not believe. Redemption is only for those who believe on the Lord and who obey his commandments. While it is true that Christ Jesus ‘tasted death for every man’ (Heb. 2:9), that means for every man who w<sup>y</sup>ill obey the Lord. God is no respecter of persons, and his rules apply to all; therefore the ransom sacrifice is for all men that believe and obey the laws of God. The Scriptures state the matter in this way: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” “Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”—Rom. 5:12,18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> It is impossible for a free gift to be bestowed upon any person when that person shuns or refuses to accept the gift of the prize offered. God offers life to man as a free gift, upon condition that he be required to believe on the Lord and to obey. The man who by his course of action says, ‘I don’t believe there is an Almighty God, and I don’t believe that Jesus Christ bought the human race with his own precious blood,’ that man refuses to accept the gift of life, and the condemnation resulting from Adam’s disobedience remains upon that man; which means everlasting death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> God does not compel anyone to believe, nor does he bestow life on anyone contrary to that person’s desire. “God is love”; which means that God is entirely unselfish. God is self-contained and he needs nothing from any creature, but is entirely unselfish, and in his loving-kindness he has provided a way for man to escape eternal death and receive life everlasting, and that way is by always looking up. “In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.”—1 John 4: 9,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> Those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and who render themselves in obedience to his commandment, are designated by the Lord his “sheep”, because such word is used as a symbol of obedience. Therefore Jesus says: “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”—John 10:10,11,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The wise man looks up and believes this statement, and deports himself accordingly. The present is the time when the Lord is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, and all persons who are now of good-will toward God, who have faith that Jehovah is the Almighty, and the Giver of life, and who then show their faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus by fully devoting themselves to the Lord, may now be gathered unto the Lord as of his “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSECRATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> The man of good-will must do what! He must consecrate himself to the Lord. That means that he declares he believes in God and Christ and he solemnly promises and agrees that he will be obedient to the will of God and Christ. He flees every worldly influence and organization and flees to Christ, the Head of God’s organization, and there he finds safety and protection. Doing so, he enters into a covenant or agreement to do the will of God. Now he must perform that agreement; and that he does by obeying God’s commandment as written in the Scriptures. He ascertains the will of God concerning himself by diligently studying what is written in God’s Word; and thus he seeks righteousness and meekness. His desire is for that which is right, and he seeks to learn what is right; and this he learns from the Word of God. He desires to learn the only way that leads to life; and there is but one way, and that is God’s Word. Doing thus, he seeks meekness, and now the Lord says to him: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness ; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” —Zeph. 2:3.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The man who seeks righteousness and meekness that he may find life everlasting looks above for his guidance. God’s Word is the lamp of truth that lights his pathway. Such is the path that Jesus trod; and hence the wise man knows that this is the right way that leads to life, and he follows in it. Jesus always is diligent to do the will of God. The one who walks in the way of life must do likewise. Jesus not only declared himself as being consecrated to Jehovah and the doing of His will, but symbolized that agreement by being immersed in water; and thus he testified to others. (Matt. 3:13-17) It is therefore the proper course of the man of good-will who now consecrates himself to God to symbolize that agreement to do God’s will by water baptism. Thus he shows that he believes on the Lord, and gives public testimony that he is on the Lord’s side, walking in the way of wisdom that leads to life. Having agreed to do the will of God, such man is not ashamed to so state, but delights to give testimony that he is for Jehovah and his King and kingdom. That testimony he gives both by his course of action and by the words that he speaks for the Lord and by publishing the message of The Theocracy: “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.”— Rom. 10:9-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INTEGRITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> The man of good-will, having fled to the Lord and having declared himself on the side of The Theocracy, must now maintain his integrity toward the great Theocrat and His King. This he does by obeying the commandment of God, as written: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matt. 19:17) That means to do what God has commanded must be done by all who shall receive his approval. It is the will and hence the commandment of God that every person who takes his stand on the side of God and Christ shall, by his course of action and conduct, and by his words, bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. All who are of God’s capital organization must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah. (Isa. 43:10-12) All who come under God’s organization must likewise bear testimony to his name. To fail or refuse to be a witness for Jehovah means that such one is not maintaining his integrity toward God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ, that great Spirit and Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, is now judging the nations of the earth. His “other sheep” are now undergoing trial and judgment. To obtain his final approval they must maintain their integrity by obeying his commandments. Concerning the obligation to bear testimony to the name and kingdom of God it is written: “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life [which since 1918, when Christ Jesus began judgment at the temple, has been flowing], clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne [judgment seat of The Theocracy] of God and of the Lamb.”—Rev. 22:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>51</sup> In symbolic language, that describes the water of truth that makes- clear the way to life. All who see and appreciate this hear the words of the Lord, as written: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) Thus to whosoever will obey the Lord the way is opened to come and partake of the water of truth, the water of life, and to do so “without money and without price”. —Isa. 55:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>52</sup> The man of good-will who takes his stand on the side of the Lord God and his kingdom is the man who fears God and obeys him, fearing that he might come short and fail in the way of life unless he is diligent to obey. He continues to increase in knowledge and wisdom, and thus his appreciation of his own proper relationship to God and Christ increases, and therefore he has understanding. Concerning such the Lord says: “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding: for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her.” (Prov. 3:13-18) As he grows in knowledge and understanding he sees and appreciates the truth, as it is written: “In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall have a place of refuge. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.”—Prov. 14:26,27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">reproaches</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ As long as the Devil is in existence and his organization operates every person who is diligent to maintain his integrity toward God and his kingdom will be the object of persecution by the blind guides of men and by all others of Satan’s instruments. The Devil is bent on opposing God, and in doing this he leads men into darkness and they remain in darkness. He induces men to look to their own greatness and to shun the Word of God and then induces such dupes to persecute all those who are for God and his King, thereby expecting to make the service of God a very unpopular and undesirable thing. The reason that religionists oppose and persecute the servants of Almighty God and his King is, because they are blind to the truth and are under the influence of the demons. Never has the world been so completely under the control of demons as at the present time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>54</sup> The evildoers are headed for destruction. The lot of the evil or wicked is most undesirable and is shunned by all persons who desire righteousness. The end of the wicked is near. Their time is short. The day of Armageddon is near, and at that time all who remain on Satan’s side shall suffer destruction. The lot of those who have fled to the Theocratic Organization is the blessed one. Finding refuge there and then remaining steadfastly on the side of the Lord, such person pursuing the wise course is diligent to continuously do the will of God. Thus continuing faithful, the “other sheep” of the Lord shall be brought through Armageddon and find everlasting life on the earth. To those who are now obeying the rules of the Lord and are in the antitypical city of refuge, the following scripture will be a real comfort: “Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass: and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evil doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.&quot;—Ps. 37 : 4-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>55</sup> The wise man does not desire to follow his selfish inclinations. He has chosen the Lord and his Word as his guide, and he looks to God’s Word and from it receives instruction and understanding. (Prov. 3:5-7) The wise man seeks the company and companionship of others who are also wise after God’s way. He will be diligent to attend studies where he may learn more about God’s way. He will study to show himself approved unto God. By so doing he will be pleasing to the Lord and will receive the blessings of life everlasting. He will walk circumspectly, which means to look about him and to see to it that he avoids all entanglements that beset the pathway of men. He will look up to the Lord for his guide, shield and protection. He will have his mind and heart set upon the Lord and be praying at all times that he may be guided in the way of righteousness.—Isa. 58:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark19"></a>SHORTENING THE DAYS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">•• I 1OR then shall be great tribulation, such as was not H&lt; since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved ; but for the elect’s sake, those days shall be shortened ” Prophetic words those, pronounced by the Greatest Prophet nineteen centuries ago, but now they are in course of fulfillment, and hence it is God’s due time for his people to have understanding of them. (Matt. 24:21,22) That Satan’s organization, visible and invisible, will go down amidst a terrible time of trouble is foretold by many scriptures; and about such there can be no doubt. The battle is that of the great Field Marshal of Jehovah God against the great enemy, Satan. Of course, Satan’s visible organization on earth must be involved, and in this case it is “the beast” against “The Lamb”, Christ Jesus—See Revelation 19:11-15 and 17:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God has not interfered with Satan’s nefarious course lor many centuries, but the time has come for its destruc</span><span class="font2">tion </span><span class="font3">All nations are arming with the most destructive elements man has ever dreamed of. In the past, during the great battles, profiteers, politicians and religious clergymen have either remained at home or far enough in the rear to be out of danger. In the terrible and final conflict there </span><span class="font2">will </span><span class="font3">be no place of safety. (Jer. 25: 34-36) Back in A.D. 70, when the Roman legions made the final assault upon Jeru</span><span class="font2">salem </span><span class="font3">and razed the city, completely destroying it, that was a time of great trouble and stress. The description given of it by historians seems almost beyond possibilities. That trouble was in a measure a shadow or prophetic picture of </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font3">tune of trouble with which Satan’s organization, particu</span><span class="font2">larly </span><span class="font3">so-called “Christendom”, must fall. The final trouble, the universal war of Armageddon, must be the one referred to by the great prophet, Christ Jesus, at Matthew 24.21, 22. He said that so terrible will be that final trouble that, “except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.” “Shorten” means to curtail, or abridge. To illustrate: If an hour had been appointed for the beginning of a meeting which must end at five o’clock, the length of time of that meeting could be curtailed or shortened by waiting until four o’clock to begin, instead of beginning at two. A period of time may be shortened by taking off some from either end We may be sure that the Lord God has fixed the time of trouble definitely as to when it shall cease; and that being so, if he should prevent the terrible battle from beginning until a certain period of time, that would shorten the trouble. Such seems to be the very thought expressed by the Lord in the symbolic picture at Revelation 7:1-3. In this text the “four winds” mentioned must, in harmony with other scriptures, refer to a very great time of trouble that shall come upon the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The world ended, that is, Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world ended, in A.D 1914, and that was marked by the “war in heaven” and by the beginning of the World War on earth. “And the nations were angry ” That was the beginning of sorrows upon the earth, and not the end of sorrows. (See Revelation 12:7-12, Matthew 24:3-8; Revelation 11:18.) The war progressed and wrought much destruction from 1914 to 1918. The preparations for 1919, if executed, would have brought such terrible slaughter of soldiers and noncombatants that the four years preceding would have been a mere pygmy in comparison</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suddenly the World War ended, in 1918, but neither Satan nor any of his worldly organization had anything to do with causing it to cease. The wholesale slaughter of human creatures stopped with the end of the World War, but the sorrows upon the world that began in 1914 continued. Since then the Devil by and through his organization has continued to harass the people in his endeavor to turn them against Jehovah. Jehovah God exercised his power and authority to stop the World War. The prophecy of Jesus showed that Satan would plunge the nations into the war, and also shows that Jehovah would stop the war; and He did bring it to a sudden end in 1918. (Mark 13:19,20) Why should Jehovah stop the World War! The answer is found in the words of Jesus’ prophecy: ‘And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.’ A thing can be shortened by cutting a part out of the middle as well as by cropping off one of the ends. Satan never would have stopped the World War, because his purpose was to destroy the human race; but that destruction would have brought no honor to Jehovah nor a vindication of his name. A work having to do with the vindication of Jehovah’s name must be done before the end of the great tribulation which would result in the complete destruction of Satan’s organization. Therefore, said Jesus, “For the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” It at once appears that Jehovah purposed to do something with his “elect” before the end of the tribulation upon Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The events that came to pass upon the Jews from 69 to 73 A.D. well foreshadowed what occurred during the World War and what seems now impending. At that time the Romans, as God’s executioners against the unfaithful Jews, were assaulting the religious city of Jerusalem and could have completely destroyed it, but for some reason the Roman army was suddenly withdrawn. Later the Roman forces returned and completely destroyed the hypocritical city. The words of the historian, Josephus, will be read here with keen interest, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Cestius Gallus, in the twelfth year of [Emperor] Nero, if ‘he had been inclined to break through the walls of the city by force, would instantly have taken it, and put an end to the war’; but, contrary to the expectation of all, and without any just cause, he departed. Vespasian was deputed in his place, as governor of Syria, and to carry on the wars against the Jews; and when he had subdued all the country, and was preparing to besiege Jerusalem, the death of Nero, and soon afterwards that of Galba, compelled him, from the disturbances and civil wars that ensued in his own country, to defer for some time his plan of operations against Jerusalem. These </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">apparently</span><span class="font3"> incidental delays enabled the Christians to provide for their safety; and Eusebius and Epiphanius inform us that all who believed in Christ left Jerusalem, and fled to Perea, and other places beyond the Jordan. Josephus also remarks, after the retreat of Cestius Gallus: ‘Many of the illustrious Jews departed from the city, as from a sinking ship.’ After this period, when Vespasian was confirmed in the empire, Titus surrounded the city with a wall, thirty-nine furlongs in dimensions, strengthened with thirteen forts, so that, Josephus says, ‘with all means of escaping, all hope of safety was cut off from the remaining Jews.’”—Antiquities, Book 18, Cap. sect. 3, edition Hudson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt the Lord intervened and held back the final assault upon Jerusalem until his own due time, in A.D. 70. It was exactly forty years from the date of Christ’s death to the very day that Masada, the last fort of Israel, fell in A.D. 73. God does everything on time, in his own due time. The complete destruction of the nation and the expulsion of the Jews from the land could not take place until the 15th day of Nisan, A.D. 73; and this is the real reason why the Romans did not destroy the last Jewish stronghold earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As in the case of Jerusalem under siege by the Romans, with equally strong reasoning it must be agreed that the Lord God caused the World War to come suddenly to a halt in 1918. He had a purpose in this. That there is a great destructive and final conflict just ahead no Christian that is familiar with the Scriptures can seriously doubt. Why should it be held back! Jesus answers, “For the elect’s sake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who constitute the elect, and what is the purpose of the elect! The elect company is made up of Christ Jesus and the members of “his body”, whom the Lord elects to be members of the kingdom of heaven, and all of whom maintain their integrity toward Jehovah and all of whom Satan has sought to destroy. That men have been taken out of the world and made a part of the elect and have maintained their integrity toward Jehovah disproves Satan’s contention and is to that extent a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The purpose of selecting this company of elect is that the name of Jehovah might be made known by them as his witnesses before the final battle. After the Jews were given the exclusive opportunity for a period of years, then Jehovah “did visit the Gentiles [the nations], to take out of them a people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) The elect must be used for Jehovah’s purposes at the time that He ‘plants the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth’, at which time Jehovah makes it known that Zion is his Theocratic organization. (Isa. 51:16) Jehovah puts his hand over the members of the elect on the earth, thus providing their protection from the assaults of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning his elect Jehovah says: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles [the nations], I the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font3"> have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles. I am the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font3"> ; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.” This scripture, Isaiah 42:1, 6, 8, shows that Jehovah will use the members of the “elect” company on earth for a specific purpose during the time of tribulation, and that he gives this honor to none other. The shortening of the days of tribulation must take place while some of the elect are yet on the earth, for the reason that the witness work which they do, by the Lord’s grace, must be done on earth before the final end of Satan’s organization. Therefore, in answering the question concerning the signs or proofs of the end of Satan’s rule of the world, Jesus also said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The “gospel” or “good news” to all lovers of righteousness is that Satan’s rule has come to an end; that the kingdom of Jehovah, which will completely vindicate his name, is here; that Christ Jesus has been placed upon the heavenly throne as the great Ruler, and that all must know that Jehovah alone is the Almighty God over the whole earth.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was for the sake of Jehovah God’s witnesses that the trouble has been held back. It is a well-known fact that during the World War the opportunity for proclaiming the message of the Kingdom was restrained and limited up to the spring of 1919. In the warring nations many of the brethren were forced into the army. Circulation of the “present truth” literature was prohibited. Many brethren in different countries were imprisoned. Persecution began especially in 1917; and in the spring of 1918 officers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Society</span><span class="font3"> were imprisoned, the Bethel home at Brooklyn, N. Y., was dismantled, the Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold, and the headquarters removed to small quarters in Pittsburgh, Pa. For some time thereafter little or no witnessing was done. The conditions were such at that time that had the World War progressed and not come to an end there would have been no more public witness of any consequence given on earth. The ceasing of the work at that time was prophetically pictured by the taking away of the prophet Elijah by a whirlwind, with a chariot and horses of fire, heavenward.—2 Ki. 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between the taking away of Elijah and the beginning of operations by his successor, Elisha, there was a period of waiting while Elisha stood by the Jordan river’s bank before getting across. This foreshadowed a period of waiting with the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s people on earth. Elisha’s activities foreshadowed the work of Jehovah’s witnesses done after 1918. That work must be done because the Lord had so ordained it. Since Elisha as one of Jehovah’s witnesses pictured the faithful remnant of witnesses doing a certain work, then it follows that the remnant of “the elect” must do that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now call to mind the question that was propounded to Jesus by his disciples concerning the end of the world (Matthew 24:3), and the answer of the Master thereto. In his answer he first mentioned the World War, the famines, the pestilences and the earthquakes in various parts of the earth, which would mark the beginning of sorrows upon the world. He then refers to the persecution upon his true followers. All of this took place from 1914 to 1918. He said: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Vs. 9) Many of the Lord’s devoted people were actually killed; and all the warring nations hated Jehovah’s faithful servants, and continue to. Jesus then said: “Many [shall] be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.” (Vs. 10) This was actually fulfilled when some who had been active in the Lord’s service became angry in. 1917 and 1918, and consulted and connived with those who prosecuted and persecuted the faithful Christians during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trouble reached a climax in the spring of 1918. Many of Jehovah’s servants thought that all the work was done. But there was something more to be done. What had come to pass brought great joy to their hearts, even though many then were suffering imprisonment and others were being denied opportunities of service. They rejoiced because of the clear proof that the world, or Satan’s uninterrupted rule, had ended with the end of the Gentile Times, in 1914, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, and that the day of their deliverance drew nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But they overlooked something else that must be done. The good news of the Kingdom as established must be told to others; because Jesus had commanded, after foretelling the World War: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” In other words, there must be a period of comparative peace after the World War in order that the followers of the Master, the witnesses for Jehovah, should carry this good news as a testimony unto all the nations. Had not the war ceased, this would have been impossible; because the nations would not have permitted the witnessing to go on. Now “for the elect’s sake” the Lord stopped the war. The “four angels standing on the four corners of the earth” are now “holding the four winds of the earth” until this witness can be completed. (Rev. 7:1-3) In Europe-the work of proclaiming the Kingdom message seems to be done, and manifestly this is because God’s due time has come. It would then appear that the final witness would be given on the Western Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surprise was expressed that the war stopped so suddenly. The Lord wanted it stopped. In due time he saw to it that his servants in various parts of the earth were released from prison that preparation might be made for the “Elisha work”, that is, the bold and fearless witness concerning Jehovah’s name and his Kingdom unto the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The knowledge of this fact should thrill the heart of every Christian. The fact that the great Jehovah God and the Lord Jesus Christ, “The King of kings,” would intervene and stop the warring nations, and command peace, in order to give a little handful of Christians in the earth an opportunity to be his witnesses is too marvelous to be expressed in words. It should humble every Christian in the presence of the Lord, causing him to lift his heart in fervent gratitude to God and to the Lord Jesus and then to tighten up his armor and advance into the warfare against demonism or religion with renewed zeal and energy. Otherwise stated, the Lord commands the forces of earth to cease from firing and to stand still and wait until his little band of followers invade the nations and kingdoms of the earth and testify to the fact that the kingdom of heaven has begun. Has not this been fulfilled? During the past twenty years have not Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions gone into nearly every nation on earth? Read, if you have not already done so, the report in the 1941 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses,</span><span class="font3"> setting forth that during the service year of 1940 there were placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 28,264,329, in many languages, and that this brings the total placement of books and booklets with the people since 1921 up to 337,749,320, not including hundreds of millions of magazines and free tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Never were creatures more honored than those who are witnesses for Jehovah now. Truly it is sweet music in the ears of these when they hear the command from the Lord: “Jerusalem, Fear thou not; 0 Zion, let not thy hands be slack.” (Zeph. 3:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Had the war not ceased in 1918 many of these would not have had an opportunity to learn of the Lord’s great Theocratic arrangement and to participate in the witness. Many of these give evidence of being spirit-begotten and anointed as commissioned witnesses for Jehovah, and are accordingly engaged in giving the witness, while an increasing number of persons of good-will are hearing the message and joining the spirit-begotten remnant in giving the witness. May it not be truly said, then, that for the sake of “the elect” the Lord has held back the final trouble of Armageddon and ‘shortened those days of tribulation’ not only that they themselves might be gathered, but that they might participate in the work of giving the witness in the name of the Lord in behalf of the unnumbered multitude of the Lord’s “other sheep” ? These shall be of the “flesh” that shall survive the battle of Armageddon, just as Noah and his family in the ark survived the Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you are one of those coming to a knowledge of the Kingdom truth as a result of this great witness since the cessation of the World War of 1914-1918, then give grateful thanks to Jehovah God and his anointed King, Christ Jesus; and see to it that every faculty with which you are endowed is now used to his praise and to the carrying out of his commandment to </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">be His witness.</span><span class="font3"> Would that the Lord’s people all over the earth might enter fully into an appreciation of what has been done for them during these past years by the Lord’s holding back the terrible trouble that is impending and is now so near' If we see, then, the oncoming storm of Armageddon and know that Jehovah wants the witness given beforehand, why should we not hasten on! If we love the Lord we will do so. They that really love the Lord will “have boldness” in this day of the proclamation of the message of The Theocratic Government.— 1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are well along in the year 1941. Let everyone now who really loves the Lord abandon religion and put aside selfishness and, moved by the spirit of a loving devotion to Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ, make the few remaining months the greatest witness yet given or possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">HE nations are angry that Christ Jesus has been enthroned above as rightful ruler of the world and has taken his power and reigns in the midst of his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is in fulfillment of prophecy, at Psalms 2:6 and 110 1,2 and Revelation 11: 15-18. The Devil has been ousted from heaven (Rev. 12:1-12), and he sees he must act quickly to keep the people deceived and not permit them to see, hear and understand the message concerning Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The peoples of earth have suffered long from strife and war. They would now welcome peace coming in any reliable manner. The great deceiver, the Devil, would make the people believe their desire for peace can be had only by following the lead of the most powerful religious system in “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The subsidized press, which gives more and more space to the affairs of that religious system, therefore announced as with a great blare of trumpets that the “holy father” instituted a new festival day, to be known as “The Feast of the Kingdom of Christ”, and which has since 1925 been observed on the last Sunday of October annually. The following quotations are taken from that press dispatch from Rome:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new festivity, says the Pope, is a part of the program of his Pontificate—“The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ ” By recalling each year to every one’s mind that Christ is King of all the peoples of the world, it will be an efficacious remedy against “the pest of our age”, namely, laicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Laicism, continues the encyclical, by lowering Christianity to the level of all other religions, even false ones, causes “discord between nations, unleashing of passions often disguised as patriotism, covetousness for earthly possession, contempt of domestic duties, discord and instability in families, threatens society itself with rum”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the encyclical exhorts all Christians “to militate courageously under the banner of Christ the King, to go back with apostolic fervor to the rebels and misguided ones and strive to maintain the rights of God himself intact”; for “when in international meetings and parliaments the sweet name of our Redeemer is passed in shameful silence it is highly necessary to acclaim it publicly, announcing everywhere the rights of his sovereign dignity and power”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In conclusion the encyclical states that the church claims as its right complete liberty and mdependence from civil power, the same conditions being extended to religious [Catholic] orders and organizations of both sexes. The Pontiff closes with the reminder</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">that not only private individuals must publicly venerate and obey Christ, but also magistrates, law-makers and princes, as one day they will be “called to account to God if they do not obey the divine commands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the face of it this appeared to many as a laudable move to get all the people to recognize Christ as King and therefore that such encyclical was the proper thing. It sounded well to millions deceived thereby. Facts and Scripture show it was a plain hypocritical move of the Devil, through his organized system, to turn the minds of the people toward the Roman Catholic system and away from God’s true kingdom, his Theocratic Government by Christ Examination of the encyclical issued by the pope shows he regards himself as the true representative of Christ on earth and that thereby the people giving allegiance to the kingdom of Christ must do it through him. Since the inauguration of the above feast, Nazism has taken control of Germany and in July of 1933 the pope entered into a Concordat with the Nazi dictator, which Concordat stands today, as also does the pope’s Concordat with the Fascist dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nazism, Communism, Fascism, and all manner of religious isms mean one and the same thing, because all such totalitarian or dictatorial rule is against Jehovah God and his Theocracy. All the dictators embrace and practice religion or demonism. All are against Jehovah and Christ Jesus, “The Higher Powers”, therefore all such are against The Theocracy. Dictatorial power, like a great ravenous beast, is overrunning and spoiling the earth. As symbolically described in Revelation chapter 17, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is riding upon the back of that ravenous beast. All the dictators and their supporters are against the witnesses of Jehovah who are bearing testimony to the name of the Most High and to his Theocratic King and kingdom. Dictators have turned the nations against Jehovah God; therefore the nations once professing to serve God have entirely forgotten him and become his enemies Psalm 9:17 shows their fate to be destruction at Armageddon.</span></p>

This is the program Nazi agents say will be revealed by Berlin “as soon as the attack on Britain succeeds.” I recently have had the opportunity to learn the inside story of future German policy as told to the highest South American leaders in “strict confidence” by German agents now operating as diplomats or undercover men m South American countries A president of an important “sister republic” himself told me what the Nazis have been telling him. . . . Also the information which he gave me was confirmed in other quarters by diplomats and observers who are in positions to know what is going on m South America. . . . suspicion is Latin America’s natural attitude toward everyone. They began to believe that the Reich m its assistance to General Franco was really anti-clerical and anti-church From the beginning, however, German agents smiled knowingly and told South Americans to wait and see what Hitler would do later These agents spoke of the pact with Stalin as a clever trick which would be scrapped when Russia had been used. Now they are predicting that the time is near when Hitler can return to his former position as the arch foe of Communism and the protector of all things godly. They warn conservative Latin American leaders not to “fall” for Anglo-American propaganda to the effect that Hitler is a godless revolutionary These agents also say that when England has been subdued the wo: Id will witness der Fuehrer in his true and real light. He will then be able to show Latin America that he is a friend of the Catholic church and the one man who made the world safe for the Catholic anti-Communist communities such as Franco Spain and the pies-ent conservative forces in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and other Latin American countries</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REFUGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June 20, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Henry P Drey, Oakland, California. Dear Brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A need for refuge appeared to some of God’s people, and an effort was made to provide a refuge organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Purpose:</span><span class="font3"> The purpose was and is to provide a place where children of the consecrated, who have been expelled from school, might receive instruction and where shelter and food could be produced and provided for that purpose, and where all concerned, including the children, would work to carry out the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Committee was formed to attempt to carry out that purpose. That Committee presented the matter to various brethren assembled at various places. It now appears that many who heard the Committee misunderstood the purpose and confusion has resulted. Some appear to have understood that everyone of the consecrated should sell or give up all their property and donate their all to the Refuge Organization, and that a place would be provided for all such to be housed and fed and live together as a community. That understanding is entirely erroneous With such misunderstanding some have contributed their money to the general fund and probably some have unduly denied or burdened themselves in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Society . </span><span class="font3">Numerous letters have been received asking if the Society is backing this Refuge Organization. As this office has repeatedly stated, the Society is organized and incorporated to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom and therefore cannot undertake to provide schools, houses and other places of refuge. Therefore the Society can assume no responsibility whatsoever concerning the same Seeing the need of help to be provided for some that are in need the Society certainly would not object to brethren acting independently and together in. putting forth a joint effort to make provision for the needy; but the responsibility for so doing must rest upon those who attempt to do so. While the Society does not and could not object, it cannot assume the responsibility. The Society is ready and willing to co-operate in any way possible, which includes the formulating of rules and regulations and the appointment of some suitable person to manage the refuge, but as to cairying the expense of such organization, that cannot be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many wild, unauthorized and extravagant statements have been made and many unnecessary and silly letters have been written and circulated concerning such organization, and this has resulted in many letters of inquiry showing a misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commission of God’s people is to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom, and each individual must do what he can to provide the things decent and necessary for himself and dependent ones and to help others in need insofar as it appears to him that he can do so. It is not for anyone else to say what he shall or shall not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">F A R M S</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Advice . </span><span class="font3">My adviee is that those who have received in advance from the Refuge Committee money with the view of advancing the organization, and have received the same without the approval, in writing, of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Auditing Committee, should return </span><span class="font3">such sums of money to the treasurer of the committee who holds the funds; that the necessary and legitimate expense incurred by the committee in their endeavor to organize a refuge organization be paid out of the funds in hand; that the money remaining be returned to the contributors in proportion to the amount contributed, or disposed of in such a manner as each contributor may request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You are hereby authorized to transmit the information contained in this letter to any person who desires to know the situation, and further to inform all inquiring ones that while the Society feels very sympathetic toward some provision being made for the needy, and will be glad to see such done, the Society as such cannot undertake it because its commission is to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom. The witness work now is the all-important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The attempted effort to create a refuge organization has greatly enlarged the correspondence m this office, and I therefore ask you to undertake the transmitting of the information herein contained to inquirers, that the time of our office workers here maybe given entirely to the carrying on of the work which the Lord has commissoned them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No doubt all have acted in good faith with the hope of providing some help, but the effort has not been attended, as it appears, with the Lord’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has heretofore issued a letter to the effect that where brethren who own property, and could reasonably do so, provide a place for pioneers to park their trailers while engaged in the service, and which pioneers might assist in doing some work on the premises when not engaged in the field service of the Loid, that might be done; but that was merely advisory. It appeals to be easy for some to misunderstand an effort put forth to help others and to make many extravagant statements, without authority, which causes confusion. I hope you may be blessed by the Lord’s grace to assist in putting this matter clearly befoie those who may inquire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wishing you the Lord’s blessing, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother by His grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC AMBASSADORS AND THE “BLITZ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At Sheffield a party of five pioneers were making back-calls during the evening blackout, when the warning sirens sounded. The transport in the city had stopped running, and, having no means of making for home, they all returned to the Kingdom Hall in the center of the city. A heavy raid was soon in progress. With Nazi-Papal bombs screaming and crashing around them, they went down into the basement for greater safety. Cartons of books were piled up to the ceiling as added support for the floor above. A high explosive bomb scored a direct hit on the adjoining building, the force of the explosion lifting the basement floor on which were crouching the five pioneers. After hours of terrifying experience they groped their way from the half-wrecked building and, picking their way amidst debris and bomb craters, eventually arrived home. Almost half the center of the city had been destroyed. One Merseyside town has been so devastated that the three pioneers resident there have been compelled to leave, having found it impossible to continue work. Three pioneer homes in London have been rendered uninhabitable by bomb-blast. In the case of a fourth home a bomb demolished the house next door, but by a miracle the home was undamaged. One pioneer has been killed. He was indoors when a bomb exploded near by, and a splinter [of the bomb] penetrated the outside wall of the house and killed him. Another pioneer, a German refugee, was severely injured by another splinter at the same time, and has been in hospital for some time, but is now recovering. A number of Kingdom Halls have been demolished, while the office and Bethel Home in London have had several narrow escapes. At Bristol a blitz commenced two hours after the zone assembly had finished, and the Kingdom Hall, together with the hall that had been used for the assembly, was razed to the ground. A number of pioneers have been bombed out of their homes, some more than once, while others have found their territory rendered unworkable and have had to move to new districts. Often pioneers have arrived at an assignment of territory to commence work, only to find it almost completely devastated and, on occasions, the rescue workers are still extricating the bodies of the victims. In a few instances pioneers have been present when Nazi raiders have swooped down to machine-gun the people on the streets. In spite of all these hindrances these faithful servants frequently brave the bombs and falling shrapnel from the guns, in order to get to the people of good-will. Phonographs and records are often loaned to the interested, and played in air-raid shelters at night. The pioneers join the people in their shelters too and conduct model studies with them, while the guns crash around them and the bombs continue to fall. These frightful experiences often result in stimulating the pioneers to a greater and more determined effort.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ROAD CAMP (CALIF.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Violation of some rules of this camp by some inmates endangered the privileges of the entire camp. To bring justice upon all implicated, general camp court was called and held Thursday night, conducted entirely by inmates. Selection of a judge came first. The boys desired one who would be impartial, honest, and just, to try the ones suspected Chairman called order, one was nominated, but quickly overruled. A brief silence of the two hundred present, broken by one who timidly said, ‘Jehovah!’ Then the vast majority thunderously said: ‘Jehovah! Yes, Jehovah! Let Jehovah be judge!’ referring to me, as some have mockingly called me by the name of the Most High many times previously. Nearly every man in camp knows the name Jehovah and that I am one of His witnesses. I arose, all faces toward me; silence a pin could have been heard. Said I, ‘Because of conscientious objections I am not able to serve in the capacity of judge.’ Almost in one voice they broke forth: ‘Overrule the conscientious objections! Subpoena him! We want him as judge; he can give us the fairest and most honest trial of any man in camp, and we will get more justice from him than anyone else!’ I arose again and said: ‘My conscientious objections stand.’ They again wanted to overrule it, but the chairman called attention to the fact that they could not do this; so they selected another, who did his best. Little did I realize that so many of the boys placed such a great amount of confidence in me as an ambassador of The Theocracy. Thus were seen the effect and fruit of my labor and positive stand for Jehovah and his King and kingdom. As far as I know the matter is settled and the privileges restored. The Devil is trying to take away even what freedom is still enjoyed here. Considering that it is for five months, the amount of witnessing done here is small, to wit, 29 books, 565 booklets, 191 magazines, 50 hours’ work, and played every set of phonograph lectures, with a total attendance of 162, and 15 back-calls Many here have shown a great deal of respect for Jehovah’s provision for their blessing and opportunity to receive life everlasting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MODEL BIBLE STUDIES IN WARTIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In England here it is not hard to understand that we are in the ‘last days, when perilous times have come’, especially if you are on your way to a model study and suddenly the wailing sound of an air raid is heard, and presently the drone of approaching aircraft, and then the whistle of a bomb or two coming down. That is all the more reason why we must hasten to the people of good-will and comfort them in spite of all terrors and opposition. My young sister, who has recently become a pioneer and assigned to the Manchester pioneer home, and I worked a private assignment of territory through and were able to get five model studies started. One night, working late at the depot, I could not get along as usual to call for other interest in the neighborhood of a model study. As it happened, I had told the lady of this previously and had mentioned who the people were To my surprise she went around and called for them herself, and that night there were twelve at the model study, the most there had ever been. We took them to the Kingdom Hall for the Kingdom service meeting, where they ordered the new lecture record, ‘Message of Hope.’ By the next Sunday they had both been on the witness work, the husband having arranged to call back on a family and start a model study. Now these people are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers, come to Kingdom Hall, and go to each other’s model study, and last week the young girl went into the field service Most remarkable of all, the husband’s two sisters have become pioneers and have been assigned to the Manchester pioneer home. The far-reaching effect of the model study is wonderful, because it is Jehovah’s provision.”</span></p>

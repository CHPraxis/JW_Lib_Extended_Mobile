<p><span class="font1">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos Is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness In the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;My covenant will I not</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;TEHOVAH’S covenant cannot be altered or hin-I dered. His covenant named in the above text is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> his unbreakable word that his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, his Beloved One, shall be established and rule the world in righteousness. Let this be firmly fixed in the mind of every one who loves Jehovah: that The Theocratic Government is of greatest importance, because by it Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated; that the completion and operation of that Theocracy is about to be revealed to all creation, and that now the demons have mustered all their force and power to resist The Theocracy that they might continue to rule the world in wickedness. The controversy is that all the demons are against The Theocracy, and which controversy will be settled finally at Armageddon. The prophecy of Daniel now being understandable makes clear the issue and enables servants of Jehovah to see and to appreciate that individual salvation, while important to creatures, is of small importance when compared to The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> That Jehovah’s everlasting covenant is his expressed purpose to set up The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, who w’ill rule the world in righteousness, is made certain by the Scriptures: “He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations: which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac.”—Ps. 105: 7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham was a unilateral, unconditional declaration that he would bring forth his Seed, Christ Jesus, the King, and the associate members of his kingdom, and that Christ should be King of The Theocracy and rule the world in righteousness. David, whose name means “Beloved”, was a type of Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, and concerning him and his covenant Jehovah long ago said: “I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.&quot;—Ps. 89:34.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever, as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.”—Ps. 89: 3,4, 34-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* It is that covenant which Jehovah promised to make clear to those who love and serve him, and concerning which he says: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.”—Ps. 25:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It is against that everlasting covenant, The Theocracy, that Satan has fought from the beginning of his rebellion until the present time. Now in these last days all the demons, with their chief in the lead, have mustered all their forces to fight against The Theocracy. The demon forces include all nations and creatures on the earth that are against the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus. The forces are lined up for the great battle; and concerning this Jesus said to John, and now reveals to the people whom John represented, the remnant, the meaning thereof, to wit, “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”— Rev. 16:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Upon the earth there is a “remnant” of the anointed of Jehovah, all of whom are entirely devoted to The Theocracy and who now must and shall hold fast their integrity or blamelessness before God. “And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” (Rev. 14: 5) All the demons invisible and visible are against these faithful servants of God. Jehovah and his King are for the remnant, and therefore they rejoice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> At this point it seems fitting to call attention to that text of the Bible which for many years has been known as a “Sunday school text”, and which has been much misunderstood and greatly misapplied, to wit:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only The salvation of creatures from death and the giv-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Religionists have said that God so loved the world of mankind, human creation, that he gave his Son to save them. Certainly that is not the meaning of the text. The words of the Lord are, “For God so loved the world”; the world of righteousness is that which God loves. Certainly God does not love the world controlled by the Devil and his demons, which was destroyed in the flood. Certainly he does not love the present wicked world, of which Satan is the god, nor does He love the wicked agencies in the earth that defame Jehovah’s name and persecute his people and continuously oppose The Theocracy. From the beginning it was God’s purpose to have a new world wherein dwelleth righteousness. The apostle Peter, under inspiration, wrote: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness?’— 2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> The promise here referred to is the promise God made to Abraham that in his Seed all the families of the earth that live shall bless themselves, that is to say, all nations and peoples that ever live must receive their blessing by first accepting Christ and devoting themselves to The Theocratic Government by Christ. They take the step of receiving the blessing by believing and obeying.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> “The seed according to the promise” is The Christ, Head and body, which constitutes the “new heavens”, that is to say, the official Theocratic Government, the capital organization. The “new earth” is God’s faithful princes on earth carrying out the orders and judgments of the King, Christ Jesus. The world of righteousness consists of the invisible, which is The Christ, and the visible, which<sup>1</sup> is the representatives of The Christ on earth. It is this “world”, that is, the world of righteousness, The Theocracy, that God so loved that he appointed, anointed and gave his beloved Son to be the King and Ruler of it. It is this new world, the Holy City, that comes down from heaven and rules the things in the earth, and now the time has come when Jehovah is making clear to his people through Christ the meaning of his great love for the world of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> God sent forth his beloved Son Jesus to carry out his purpose, and, in order for any of the human race to be changed from human to spirit and to be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom and thereafter be a part of The Christ, they must be redeemed. Therefore, says the scripture, God “gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”. ing to them of everlasting life is secondary to God’s great purpose to establish The Theocracy, the new world, the new heaven and the new earth. It is only those who devote themselves to The Theocracy that can ever have life everlasting. Their devotion must be to Almighty God and to Christ Jesus, his King; otherwise they perish. Then the Scripture adds: “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”—John 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Certainly this means not the salvation of individuals as a primary purpose, but means that God, for his name’s sake, would establish his Theocratic Government, the new heavens, and through it establish a new earth of righteousness, wherein dwelleth righteousness and where righteousness shall prevail and persist for ever. Religionists have given too much importance to themselves, and thereby Satan has succeeded in blinding their minds to the great and important thing of The Theocratic Government. Today God makes this matter so plain that The Theocracy stands out far and above everything else and is therefore of paramount importance, for the reason that it is The Theocracy that vindicates Jehovah’s name. This is “the everlasting covenant”, his unbreakable word that he would have a Seed that would honor His name, vindicate his name, and provide a means of salvation to all of those who willingly put themselves under The Theocracy and devote themselves to God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> John was given a vision of the new heaven and the new earth. In vision he saw the Holy City, which is The Theocracy, coming down from God out of heaven to rule in righteousness. It is that Theocracy by Christ Jesus that will carry out God’s purpose to wipe out wickedness and bring joy and everlasting peace to those that live. It is in that Theocracy, Zion, where God shall dwell; as John wrote concerning his vision: “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” Certainly that means that every human creature that lives everlastingly must be wholly and completely devoted to Almighty God and to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This is the covenant that Jehovah God remembers for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, which covenant he made with Abraham and swore to Isaac, the antitypical Christ Jesus, that in his Seed, The Christ, blessings shall come to those who obey. It is concerning this covenant that Jehovah said to his Beloved One: ‘I will establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.’—Ps. 89: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> We here return to a consideration of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the two “kings”. To deceive the people generally and to keep them from hearing and understanding the Word of Jehovah God, the chief of demons pushes the nations into war and he sets the heart of his “king of the north” “against the holy covenant” (Dan. 11: 28), that is, against The Theocratic Government. “The king of the north,” which is the demon-controlled, totalitarian organization of the present time, is blind to the truth and holds to the fallacy that the world can be and shall be ruled by human creatures who trust in religion or demonism as their god.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>111</sup> Another wing of earth’s organization, called “the king of the south”, holds to the delusion that the nations can be ruled and shall be ruled by so-called “democracies”, contrary to the Theocratic rule. Both of those kings are against Christ, the world’s Rightful Ruler, and are against all of the Lord’s faithful servants now on the earth; and therefore Jesus says to the faithful: “And ye shall be hated of all nations [of those two ‘kings’] for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24:9) The prophecy now turns to the events that come to pass within the period of “the time of the end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> “At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.” (Dan. 11:29) “He” named in this verse is “the king of the north”, represented in the nations that formed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dreibund,</span><span class="font4"> with the Papacy riding on top as spiritual adviser and ally, the purpose of the combine being to restore the so-called “Holy Roman Empire” and to gain world dominion. “The king of the north” began the World War against “the king of the south”. The military leader of “the king of the north” was the kaiser of Germany, who set out to get the Suez Canal and to invade Egypt. Great Britain then dominated and controlled the Suez and hence stood as representative of “the king of the south”. That world war, beginning in 1914, raged for four years and ended without success to “the king of the north”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “But it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former [time].” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> In the former time, that is, in the days of the Caesars, the military power of Rome defeated “the king of the south” and Egypt fell to Rome. “In the latter time,” beginning with the 1914 war, the result was different, as the prophecy states. When the armistice was signed in A.D. 1918 “the king of the north”, with Germany in the lead, had suffered defeat. “The king of the north” not only lost out, but suffered a dreadful wound in the head. “And I saw one of his heads, as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.” (Rev. 13:3) “The king of the south” inflicted that wound, as shown by what follows: “For the ships of Chittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant; so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.”—Dan. 11: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The “ships of Chittim” are easily identified as the naval power of Great Britain. Like Britain, Chittim is an island, which island, meaning Cypress, was ceded to Great Britain by the Convention of Constantinople in 1878; and on November 5, 1914, Great Britain annexed Cypress, which therefore became part of the realm of “the king of the south”. The navy of Britain imposed a blockade against Germany and allies during the 1914 world war, which had much to do with the defeat of “the king of the north” at that time. In 1917 the United States of America, the then leading democracy of the earth, entered the war on the side of Britain, and that had much to do with bringing about the defeat of “the king of the north”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> “Therefore he [the king of the north] shall be grieved, and return.” “The king of the north,” with Germany in the military lead, was defeated in November, 1918, and was thereafter greatly humiliated by the Versailles Treaty, and the wound which it had received in the head caused great pain and suffering. Hence “the king of the north” withdrew to his own realm in Germany and set about to recover from the disastrous effects of the war. Before the World War “the king of the north” had his heart set against the Holy Covenant, that is to say, determined to oppose the rule of the earth by Jehovah’s government by Christ Jesus. Following the disastrous results of the World War “the king of the north” began to express hatred against those who supported the covenant kingdom, that is, The Theocracy, and hence against the “holy covenant”, and this hatred was manifested by punishment heaped upon those devoted to and supporting The Theocracy. Hence following the World War and his return to his own realm “the king of the north”, as stated, expressed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“INDIGNATION AGAINST THE HOLY COVENANT”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> That indignation was expressed and continued to be expressed against the Kingdom covenant, The Theocracy, and which indignation has grown in intensity until the present time. (Luke 22:28-30) Instead of giving heed to the message of the truth proclaimed of and concerning the Holy Covenant, or Theocracy, “the king of the north” apparently for a time set up a democracy, which lasted only a short season, but which in fact was not a democracy. Shortly thereafter Italy came into control of former Austria-Hungary territory and quickly lined up with the Papacy to start “the king of the north” on the way to conquest. Germany hastened to do its part. On October 30, 1922, the Fascists assumed control of the Italian government and Mussolini made himself dictator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The Versailles congress had brought forth the League of Nations and set that up in the place and stead of The Theocracy. The religious element of “the king of the south” hailed the League of Nations as “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”, but failed to state which god was meant. By approving the League of Nations the Holy Covenant was opposed. But in the latter part of 1926 Italy, Austria and Germany were all in the League, and hence both of those “kings” showed themselves against the Holy Covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Shortly following the World War Jehovah’s message of and concerning the “holy covenant” Kingdom began to be widely proclaimed throughout Gernlany, and many of the German people rejoiced to hear that message and they put themselves on the side of The Theocracy. The World War had brought great distress upon the German people, and they were greatly humiliated by the position in which they had been placed; and while the politicians and religionists smarted under their humiliating condition, sincere persons of good-will in Germany gave their heart devotion to Jehovah’s kingdom, and that angered the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and that religious organization poured more poison into the cup of Germany to be dished out to those who favored The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> “He shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font4">That is to say, “the king of the north” gave heed to the counsel of the spiritual adviser, the Vatican. Crafty effort was put forth and made by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy operating in Germany, inducing Germany to forsake freedom of speech and of worship and to return to the arbitrary state previously followed by “the king of the north”. Hence the Nazi movement was launched in Germany in May, 1919. Hitler rapidly forged to the head of the Nazi party. In 1922 Cardinal Ratti became pope, and shortly thereafter organized “Catholic Action”, the purpose of which is world domination and the suppression of the proclamation of the message of and concerning the Theocratic or “holy covenant” Kingdom. The Papacy, as a part of “the king of the north”, took the lead against the “holy covenant” Kingdom and, at the instance of the chief of demons, moved forward for world domination in defiance of Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>‘Note that the prophecy says that “the king of the north” shall have regard unto the forsaker of the Holy Covenant. That means that the forsaker had at least claimed to be for the kingdom of God but had taken a contrary course. Such forsaker or forsakers of the Holy Covenant constitute what the Bible describes as “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” the most prominent part and powerful part thereof being the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. (2 Thess. 2:2-13) The Hierarchy and their religionist allies have claimed to be supporters of the “holy covenant” Kingdom, that is, the kingdom under Christ, but they show a determination to have part in world domination and rule in defiance of Almighty God and his Covenant Kingdom. No doubt there were sincere men among the Catholic clergy in times past, who had a desire to see the kingdom of God rule the world; but in due time all members of the Hierarchy stumbled over the King, pictured in the Scriptures by the 'stone laid in Zion’, and over which religionists, Catholic and Protestant, have stumbled.—Isa. 8:13,14; 28:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Note these facts in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy: The totalitarian political rulers have taken recognition of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as an ally in the program for world domination. They made a deal which is in fact an agreement and conspiracy against The Theocracy. The totalitarian political wing of the combine offer themselves as the political power and agency to bring about the rule of the world contrary to and in defiance of Almighty God, and in which conspiracy the pope and other members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy fully join and continue to participate. The Lord denounced such an alliance between the political and the religious element that operate in the name of Christ as political and religious “whoredom”, and plainly states that the religious element falsely operates in the name of God and Christ and is the “whore”, and that the political element that rules is the “beast”. Thus the religious “whore” climbed on the back of the totalitarian “beast”, and there she sits and rides. To such covenant-breakers the Lord says through his inspired witness: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”—Jas. 4: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Mussolini offered himself as a political tool of the combine on February 11, 1929, when he and the pope, Pius XI, signed a concordat or agreement defining the joint program of operation of the political and religious parts of the combine and whereby the pope became an independent political nation and ruler, and Vatican City became the political state of the religious Hierarchy. That concordat the political legislative body of Italy ratified.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Also the further facts showing the alliance between the political and religious totalitarians to rule the world contrary to The Theocracy, followed, to wit: On January 30,1933, Hitler became the chancellor of Germany; on March 23, 1933, the German Legislature, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reichstag,</span><span class="font4"> voted dictatorial power to Hitler; then on July 20, 1933, Hitler entered into a secret concordat or agreement with Pope Pius XI, and the pope performed his part by withdrawing support from the Catholic Center party of Germany, and the Nazis, or Hitler party, became the only one party of Germany; and with that party the Roman Catholic Hierarchy participates, thus showing the combine, “the king of the north,” with determination to gain world domination.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Furthermore the facts show that in carrying out of the combination or conspiracy these things came to pass, to wit: March, 1933, Dollfuss, chancellor of Austria (a part of “the king of the north”), dissolved the Parliament and ruled as dictator. On September 11, 1933, Dollfuss announced a program of national reconstruction, based upon authoritative leadership of the dictator and the Corporate State. That change brought him more support from the Fascists. On April 1, 1934, Austria ceased to be even called a republic and by its Constitution became a federal state. Its laws were declared to emanate from God (that is, meaning the pope as “God’s representative”, but in fact “the god of this world”), and not from the people. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy church organization was made the established church in Austria. There was to be no freedom of press, of the stage, of the cinema or of the radio, but all must come directly under governmental control. A Council of Culture, composed chiefly of priests and Jesuits of the Roman Catholic organization, was created and it sought secretly to carry into operation the will of the Corporate State religious combine, and concerning which Cardinal Innitzer of Vienna called that dictatorial combine an “independent Christian German Austria based on the Corporative principle and under authoritative leadership”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> These historical facts are here stated for the purpose of showing that the Axis powers, made up of the political and religious combine aforementioned, form and stand for the present “king of the north” mentioned in the prophecy of Daniel. The indisputable facts so fully and completely support and fit the prophecy that there can be no doubt about the proper identification of “the king of the north” and also about the forsakers of the covenant. After the ‘forsakers of the covenant’, meaning the “man of sin” (the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular), and the political element of “the king of the north” had entered into the arrangement above mentioned, a movement went forward for totalitarian rule or domination of the world, in which the politicalreligious Roman Catholic Hierarchy has at all times played a very active part. All of the activities of that “king of the north” combination have been and are against The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> “And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.” (Dan. 11:31) Considering this part of the prophecy, note first this: “And arms [allies, helpers] shall stand on his part”; that is, on the part of “the king of the north”. By the Treaty of Versailles “the king of the north” had been disarmed; but the victorious allies, “the king of the south,” also agreed to at least a partial disarmament, but failed to carry out that agreement. That failure of “the king of the south” furnished the excuse for Germany to re-arm, contrary to the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Italy, under the dictator, pushed its program for military preparedness; and the program for totalitarian rule of the nations of the earth put in action by “the king of the north” progressed as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">October 14, 1933, Hitler, acting for Germany, quit the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations. On March 16, 1935, Hitler proclaimed the renewal of military conscription on behalf of Germany. The following further historical facts here seem to be appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June, 1935, Hitler and Britain agreed to Germany’s building up a navy to 35 percent of the strength of Britain’s navy. Germany was also to build submarines again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The Axis powers, that is to say, “the king of the north,” the political and the religious element acting together and with full understanding, have continued their “lightning-war” with the undeniable purpose of gaining world domination. In that program of wickedness The Theocratic Government, by Christ Jesus, is denounced and openly attacked, and while the Papacy element of the combine tries to conceal its opposition to God’s Kingdom and falsely claims to be Christian, the facts to the contrary stand out boldly, as the prophecy foretells.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” “And they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength.” Undoubtedly the sanctuary here is the same as meant by the prophecy of Daniel at 9:17, to wit: “Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.” The “sanctuary” is Jehovah’s organization, which is now represented on the earth by his spiritual “remnant”, the last remaining members of the capital organization yet on the earth bearing witness to the great Theocracy by Christ Jesus: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you! If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” —1 Cor. 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The sanctuary of Jehovah is the only “sanctuary of strength”. That sanctuary, or temple company, is “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might” and filled with the joy of the Lord: “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Neh. 8:10) “The Lord is the strength of my life.” (Ps. 27:1) “He is the saving strength of his anointed.” (Ps. 28:8) That strong sanctuary is built of “living stones”, the Chief Corner Stone of which is Christ Jesus the Lord, and the other stones the members of his body. (1 Pet. 2:1-10) According to other translations of this text (Dan. 11:31) of the prophecy it is “the fortress”, or “stronghold”, which the enemy cannot overthrow. The remnant now on the earth is a part of and represents that sanctuary. They represent, therefore, the great Theocracy by Christ Jesus the King, and that Theocracy is the great stronghold to which those who love Jehovah and his King have fled for safety.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup>‘ “To pollute [or defile] the sanctuary of strength” is to oppose the Theocracy, to reproach the name oi the great Theocrat and his King, and to persecute the remnant now on the earth, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, who represent and proclaim The Theocratic Government. It was in 1931 that the faithful servants of God on the earth learned that the name of Jehovah was called upon the remnant. (Isa. 62:2; 43:10-12; Rev. 2:17) Since then in particular “the king of the north” has attempted to suppress the witness work and to destroy the witnesses who proclaim the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and who tell the people that The Theocracy is the real hope of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> To the modern political element, particularly of the totalitarian combine who practice demonism, Jehovah says by another prophet: “Say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God, Because thou saidst Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned,” you shall be punished.—Ezek. 25: 3; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PROOF OF POLLUTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Some facts are here set out showing how Jehovah’s sanctuary class has been defiled and polluted by the combine of “the king of the north”, particularly the religious element thereof, and these facts are here published to show that the prophecy has been partially fulfilled and is in further course of fulfillment now, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since 1922 the dictator of Italy has never permitted the name of Jehovah and his Theocracy to be proclaimed in that Fascist land. Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested and imprisoned and to this day are still held in prison with the full connivance of the Papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Hitler came into power as chancellor of Germany he promptly issued an order against Jehovah’s witnesses, and which order was issued at the connivance and demand of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The property of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was seized in 1933 and much of its literature was burned by the Nazis. The property of the Society was again seized in April, 1934, which seizure and confiscation was in violation of the treaty between the United States and Germany. The United States intervened in behalf of the Society, and its property was released for a short time. Then again its property was seized by Germany, without hearing the facts or even giving notice to the Society. The work of witnessing for the Kingdom was stopped by the Nazi government. Then the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses were broken up by the Nazis and thousands of Jehovah’s faithful servants were arrested and imprisoned, and many of them have been killed because of their faithfulness to The Theocracy. All that wicked persecution and defilement is । lone at the instance and demand of the Roman Cath</span><span class="font1">olic </span><span class="font4">Hierarchy, and is a part of Catholic Action to suppress everything that might hinder world domination by the Axis powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A letter of protest against the wicked treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses was sent to Hitler February 4, 1934; and on October 7, 1934, companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, assembled in many places throughout the earth, sent the following message by cable and other means to Hitler, to wit: “Your ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses shocks all good people of earth and dishonors God’s name. Refrain from further persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, otherwise God will destroy you and your national party.” The persecution continues against Jehovah’s witnesses to this day, which shows that such action is a deliberate and determined effort to defile God’s sanctuary class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Austria closed the office of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in .June, 1935, and stopped the public witness ■work of God’s people in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June 8, 1935, French Catholic Quebec, under the Vatican’s direction, entered a judgment in the Appellate Court convicting Jehovah’s witnesses of seditious conspiracy, which judgment was based solely upon evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses were distributing free literature telling of The Theocracy and the blessings it will bring to the people. In 1940 the Roman Catholic dictator of Canada declared Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society an “illegal organization” and stopped the public witness work in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since 1935 and up to 1941 the public witness work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been banned or suppressed in many of the countries, to wit: West Africa, France, Spain, all of the Nazi- and Fascist-occupied territory, Austria, Japan, and other places, and all at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is carried on in practically every part of the earth, and these faithful servants of the Lord are “hated of all nations” because of their faithfulness to God and to his kingdom.—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Further the prophecy (Dan. 11: 31) says: “And shall.take away the daily sacrifice” ; according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version:</span><span class="font4"> “Shall take away the continual burnt-offering.” The many Scripture texts bearing upon the use of the words “daily [or continual] sacrifice” show that the same have reference to the continuous or unceasing activities of Jehovah’s servants in giving praise to his name and proclaiming his Theocratic government. (See 1 Chronicles 23: 28-31; Isaiah 62:6; Hosea 12:6; Psalm 34:1; Hebrews 13:15; 1 Corinthians 15: 31.) That daily or continual sacrifice is the continuous praise of Jehovah by his servants’ bearing testimony to his name and to his government, and doing so publicly by publishing the message of the kingdom of God. This is done by the distribution of Bible literature, which informs the people of God’s gracious provision for them, and by their going from house to house and delivering to the people these truths and reproducing recorded speech, and by other means proclaiming the gospel in obedience to the command of the Lord. That public witness work is designated in the Bible as God’s “strange work”. (Isa. 28:21) The proclamation of the name and the kingdom of Jehovah greatly angers the demons and all that are under demon control. Mark this, that the prophecy says: “They shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the [continual] sacrifice.” Thus it is seen that both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” indulge in the same persecuting work against Jehovah’s witnesses, and they bitterly and relentlessly oppose The Theocracy, proving that they are both of Satanic origin and creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The two “kings” succeeded in taking away this “daily sacrifice” in 1918, during the World War, and under the pretext that the same hindered the war. After the war “the king of the north” continued to hinder and take away the “daily sacrifice” or service of Jehovah by his faithful witnesses. Now both kings, under the influence and power of the demons, continue to suppress the message of The Theocratic Government and both look forward to the time near when they shall be able to say: “Peace and safety”; particularly for the religious element thereof.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> Everywhere the totalitarian-religious crowd are against the true worship of Almighty God because that worship is to worship God in spirit and in truth and emphasizes the great truth that The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus is the only hope of humankind. The reason for the cruel opposition of the two “kings” against Jehovah’s witnesses is that the demons are desperately fighting to now hold control of the world. Therefore the demon-controlled ruling powers of the nations try to compel Jehovah’s witnesses to “worship the beast and his image”, that is to say, the rule of the world by dictators. It clearly appears from the prophecy and from all the physical facts that both the “kings” are bent on world domination in defiance of The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and hence both are in fact totalitarian and dictatorial.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘DESOLATING ABOMINATION’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> “And they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> That prophetic statement foretells the setting up by Satan and his agents of a mimic or substitute for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. The purpose is to desolate Jehovah’s servants and to bring about the desolation or destruction of all the people at Armageddon, thus desolating all the earth. That action of setting up the ‘desolating abomination’ is taken by the demons, with “the king of the north” being used by and acting for the Devil on the earth. Watch then further the nations of the earth claiming to be democratic that walk into the same trap of the demons. The setting up or placing the “abomination of desolation” has for its purpose the turning all the nations of the earth totalitarian. It is a conspiracy, drawing into and associating the nations of the earth in one confederacy against The Theocracy. “The king of the south” brought forth the League of Nations as a substitute for Jehovah’s kingdom, and on which the Papacy tried to ride but failed to get on the back thereof. The Papacy thereafter said little about or for the League of Nations. Italy was in the League of Nations from the beginning, and at that time Mussolini was against the pope. The League of Nations, organized by “the king of the south”, came into existence by the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Austria got into the League in December, 1920. Germany entered the League in 1926. Japan also went in. The League of Nations served as a temporary substitute for The Theocracy until the chief of demons and his associates brought forth and placed the more abominable thing where it has no right to be. Mark now the sly, subtle movement of the chief of demons and his principal religious representative on earth toward setting up “the abomination that maketh desolate”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> In Germany the Nazi party, with the full sanction, approval and co-operation of the Papacy, planned their own League, and an order to that end was, to wit: Hitler assumed the office of dictator on March 23, 1933, by the vote of the Reichstag. On July 20, 1933, Hitler concluded his concordat with the pope. October, 1933, Hitler quit and withdrew from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations. The same year Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. April, 1933, the pope inaugurated the “Holy Year”, and the so-called “Protestant” nations began to walk right into the trap of Satan set for that purpose. In 1934 President von Hindenburg died and Hitler took full control of the nation. Was the Vatican supporting that movement?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> The Roman Catholic bishops held a conference at Fulda, Germany, August, 1935, at the conclusion of which a letter of Roman Catholic Hierarchy authority was read from the pulpits of all Catholic churches in Germany; and concerning the Nazi rule of Germany that letter said: “The Catholic Church indisputably contributed a large share towards German obedience and respect for the leaders of the State”; meaning the Nazi leaders, of course. Thus the Roman Catholic Hierarchy reminded the German people that the Catholic church had rendered real and valuable assistance in bringing the dictator Hitler into power. Shortly thereafter, to wit, October 28, 1935, at Berlin Hitler announced that he would lead the Nazi party along the path of “positive Christianity” [that is, Catholic Action pathway], and not along the false path of anti-Christian doctrine; and he there gave assurance of such purpose to the Catholic bishop of Berlin.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> What is the ‘desolating abomination’ ? Practically everywhere in the Bible where “abomination” (Hebrew: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shikutz)</span><span class="font4"> is used it means or refers to images employed in demon-worship, that is, idol images. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy always uses images. Note what the Bible says about graven images used in the worship of demon gods: “The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein ; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God. Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it; but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.” (Deut. 7: 25, 26) “Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.” “Chemosh, the abomination of Moab.” “Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.” (1 Ki. 11: 5,7) “Ashto-reth the abomination of the Zidonians.” (2 Ki. 23:13, 24) For other Bible texts concerning images, see 2 Chronicles 15:8; Jeremiah 7:30; Jeremiah 32: 33, 34; Ezekiel 20: 30, 31. Unclean animals when eaten as food were called abominations.—Lev. 11:11,13,43; Zech. 9:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> The Israelites claimed to serve Jehovah God, and turned to demon-worship. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims to serve God, but turns to demonism and employs images in demon-worship. The “abomination that maketh desolate” represents an offering, presumably to God and Christ, and is claimed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to be so offered; but in fact it is actually offered to the demons, the chief of which is “the god of this world”, Satan. To partake of that offering means to partake of the “table of devils”, whereas the ‘continual sacrifice' was a living sacrifice on the part of God s anointed servants in that these witnesses of Jehovah served him by proclaiming “this gospel of the kingdom” and gave praise to him with their lips.— Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> The mimic theocracy set up by “the king of the north” is the idol, or “abomination”, which is placed or set up at the instance of the demons. It is the totalitarian rule, which is blessed by religious leaders of the Roman Catholic system. That totalitarian rule is put forward in the place and stead of the kingdom of Almighty God, The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It is a desolating abomination. That desolating abomination has been placed or set up and now stands where it ought not to stand. (Mark 13:14) It is the announced purpose of that abominable thing to rule the world in the place and stead of The Theocratic Government, while at the same time that mimic thing claims to operate in the name of Christ. It will deceive and is deceiving many. Who will give heed to the warning of the Lord and take a wise course?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>&quot;ON EARTH PEACE”—TO WHOM?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font2">T WAS in the autumn season, toward the first of October, and at nighttime, more than nineteen centuries ago, that the angelic train from heaven arrived and stood over the modest little city of Bethlehem. A band of shepherdmen were guarding their sheep from unfriendly attacks. They knew nothing of the coming of this heavenly host; and when the leading angel stood out to announce the birth of the “holy child”, these watchers were sore afraid. To allay their fears that heavenly messenger said to them: “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10,11) From the presence of the Eternal God these holy angels had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nine months before this the only begotten Son of God, The Logos or Word of God, had left the self-same heavenly court, having laid aside his spirit existence to become “the man Christ Jesus”, the Savior of the world. The special messenger from heaven had now made announcement to the shepherds that the Savior was born; and then the mighty host with ecstatic joy together sang: “Glory in the highest unto God! And on earth peace, among men of good-will.” Never before had ears of men heard such wondrous song. Down through the corridors of the ages its sweet melody has reverberated. Now at the coming of the new day, the day of the Lord, its meaning is understood more clearly than at any time past. That anthem, sung by the hosts of heaven, was indeed a prophecy; and its meaning to the people must in due time be understood. That due time is here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A prophecy is the foretelling of future events. It is not intended that men should understand a divine prophecy at the time it is uttered. (Dan. 12: 8, 9, 10) In God’s due time those of reverential mind and devoted heart shall understand. The prominent parts of this prophecy stated in the order of importance are: (1) The honor, good name and fame of Jehovah God; (2) “on earth peace to men of good will”. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay</span><span class="font2"> translation) In every language and tongue this prophetic message has been read by millions of people, but few have understood and fewer have profited by that understanding. Blessed are they that hear and understand and heed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostles of Jesus preached the message of peace and salvation, and many have heard and professed to believe the same. Since the year 800 A.D., when the pope on “Christmas Day” crowned the bloody Charlemagne emperor of the so-called “Holy Roman Empire”, even the nations have professed to be Christian nations. Each “Christmas season”, so called, the preachers have preached some kind of peace sermon; and the people have in some measure expressed a little good-will toward one another by giving gifts, particularly to relatives and friends from whom they expect to receive something in return. Some of the great financiers have on “Christmas” occasions loosened up their purse strings a little, and have given some temporary relief to the poor that they might receive the plaudits of men. The politicians, wielding the power to rule, have on such occasions released some unfortunate ones from prison cells, and at these seasons the religious clergy have boasted of the greatness and generosity of their allies, the commercial and political factors, while with honeyed words upon their lips these clergy have held forth their hands to receive more gifts from the people. “Christmas” in December has been well marked by hypocrisy. But, with these governing factors, commercial, political and religious, the name of Jehovah God has not been honored. Neither by their combined efforts has peace come to the people, nor does there now exist good-will amongst men, one toward another, but now the prophetic words of Jesus are fulfilled toward his faithful followers who bear witness for the name of Jehovah God: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.”—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The birth of Jesus did not bring peace on earth at that time, nor has there been a time since when complete peace has prevailed in the world. All the religious preaching that has been done in the name of Jesus has not brought peace. Addressing his disciples Jesus said: “Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.” (Luke 12:51-53) By this it is understood that those who heard and obeyed his message would be despised by those who rejected it, and that there would be trouble in the households where there was such division of opinion. It has been thus. The truth of God’s great purpose to establish his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus has caused the division in homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further Jesus said: “And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.” And this has been true throughout the entire “Christian era”. Then referring to the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world Jesus said: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.”—Matt. 24: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There may seem to be confusion and discord between the words sung by the angelic host and the words of Jesus, but could there be real conflict and inconsistency? The angels were from God and delivered his message. The Lord Jesus, the Son of God, clothed with power and authority to represent Jehovah, spoke the truth according to God’s purpose. There could be nothing inconsistent or confusing about Jehovah. “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.” (1 Cor. 14: 33) How, then, shall we harmonize the message delivered by the angels at Jesus’ birth with the words of Jesus to his disciples?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus’ words told of the conditions as they were and would be for some time because of the action of the enemy. The words delivered by the angels foretold God’s purpose which in his own due time must be carried out and bring peace on earth toward those for whom it is meant. Before there could be peace the name of God must be honored. Before there could be peace without end Jesus, as the great executive officer of Jehovah, must fight for it. The angel’s words (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Douay),</span><span class="font2"> “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of goodwill,” emphasize the fact that peace on earth is to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">men of good-will only.</span><span class="font2"> Why should the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ ever be a blessing and a joy to anyone who is not of good-will toward God? All the enemies of Jehovah God shall perish for ever, and hence to them the Kingdom will be nothing. (Pss. 21:8; 37:20) After the battle of Armageddon never again shall Satan and his religious agents and their organization be in existence. Then the memory of those wicked ones shall perish for ever: “the memory of the just is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot.” (Prov. 10:7; Isa. 26:14) Today the people on earth that are of good-will toward Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ have reason to rejoice, and should rejoice, because the time of complete deliverance and peace everlasting is near. For that reason God is now making clear his purpose to those who desire his righteous government, The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The war and troubles on earth are due to the evil influence of the wicked one, Satan the Devil, and the demons, of whom he is chief. The people are responsible because they have not kept the law of God, but have yielded to demonism or religion. The governing factors of the world are particularly responsible because they have ignored t he Lord and have not honored his name. All mankind have sinned and come short of the glory of God. In sorrow the prophet of God, at Isaiah 48:18,19, 22, cried out: “O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea; thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. . . . There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trouble on earth is due to rebellion amongst creatures, which rebellion includes both men and angels. This rebellion has brought dishonor to the name of Jehovah God The rebellion must be put down and the name of the Lord God honored before there can be lasting peace. From the beginning God purposed that the earth should be a part of his universal organization of peace and good-will. He created man in his own image and likeness and gave him dominion over the things of the earth. God made a covenant with man that he should exercise dominion over the earth in harmony with the Creator’s will. Adam violated the terms of that covenant by reason of the treachery of his invisible overlord, Lucifer, who turned traitor and became Satan the Devil. As written at Hosea 6:7: “But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.”—Marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s holy prophets were inspired to foretell the complete fall of Satan’s organization and the establishment of God’s Theocratic Government of everlasting peace on earth. Some of these prophets were given a vision of the coming of that blessed time, and they diligently sought to know the manner and the time of its coming, but they understood not. (1 Pet. 1:10-12) The mind of the patriarch Jacob was moved upon by the holy spirit of God and he declared: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah [forefather of Jesus], nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Gen. 49:10) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shiloh</span><span class="font2"> is one of the titles of the great Messiah, the Anointed One, and means “Peaceful One”. Centuries before this Peaceful One came to earth the prophet Isaiah took his position as though he were standing by the side of the manger in the city of David, Bethlehem, and said: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” —Isa. 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The obedient angels of heaven were entrusted with messages to tell to God’s earthly representatives before the birth of Jesus. These angels must have known of God’s purpose to bring peace on earth to men of good-will. Now the time had come for the greatest of all events till then to take place. A mighty host of holy and glorious heavenly creatures was organized and under the command of their leader winged their way to earth. What a joyful train! and what a blessed mission was theirs as they carried the message of eternal peace and joy to the millions of fallen men! These angels did not try to run ahead of God; and although clothed with power and authority to tell this wondrous message on earth, they did not know when the time would come for its fulfillment. About this there can be no doubt; for Jesus said so, at Matthew 24:36. Their joy was in doing Jehovah’s will; and such is the joy of every dutiful and obedient creature to Jehovah God. Then came the miraculous birth of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the fullness of time the holy child grew to manhood’s estate and entered upon the performance of his divinely given commission. Could he be at peace with Satan, the traitor and oppressor of man? Satan, as “the god of this world”, offered to compromise with Jesus when he offered Him the rulership of the evil world if Jesus would fall down and worship him, and which offer Jesus spurned. (Luke 4:6-8) The beloved Son of God refused to be misled or to be purchased by flattery or by fame. A similar temptation has since been presented to the religious clergy and they have quickly fallen and hence are honored by the political rulers of the world. Jesus came to earth to glorify his Father’s name and to do this by joyfully doing the will of God He came to destroy Satan’s organization and the evil works thereof and then to establish peace on earth in God’s due time.—1 John 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why did not Jesus destroy the Devil and set up God’s kingdom at once? This he could have done, but it would not have established peace on earth. The human race was then terribly degraded by reason of sin and the works of the wicked one. God’s loving provision was that the Lord Jesus on earth prove his integrity under test and that the human race be redeemed by his ransom sacrifice, and that then the kingdom of righteousness be established in God’s due time and God’s name be declared throughout all the earth by his witnesses and men of good-will be afforded an opportunity to hear and call upon the name of Jehovah God for salvation by Christ Jesus, and then the Devil should be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past nineteen centuries Jehovah God has made no effort to convert the world, as the religious clergy would have the people believe. On the contrary, Jehovah has been taking out from amongst the nations “a people for his name”, which people are to be associated with Christ Jesus in his Kingdom. (See Acts 15:14-18; Romans 8 16, 17.) These are they who, trusting in the merit of his sacrifice, consecrate themselves unreservedly to do the will of God and become his anointed and commissioned witnesses. To such the Lord gave instructions to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Neither the true followers nor the professed followers of Jesus were instructed to set up the kingdom of God, but, on the contrary, were commanded to await the return of the Lord and the Father’s due time when his great work should be done in his own good way. The religious clergy of “Christendom” have tried to run ahead of God and set up the kingdom before the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this time of the selection of the members of Jehovah’s royal family of which Christ Jesus is the Head there has been no peace on earth, but the very reverse. Brother has been against brother, father against son and son against father, because all the consecrated and faithful followers of Jesus have been oppressed by others under the control of Satan. Satan hates the truth and every one that follows the truth, and therefore he induces all that are under his control to oppose the truth. Therefore to this day we see the fulfillment of Jesus’ words: “Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.”—Luke 12: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now Satan and his demons are gathering all their forces for the great and final conflict. It is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. It is “the great and terrible day of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord”.</span><span class="font2"> (See Revelation 16:13-16; Joel 2 31.) In that fight the Lord God will make for himself a name, that the peoples and nations of earth may know that he is God; and then those of good-will shall appreciate the song the angels sang: “Glory to God in the highest!” “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”—Ps. 46: 10, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R</span><span class="font2"> F</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There can be no peace on earth so long as Satan is m control of the affairs of men. Satan has now been cast out of heaven and sees that his power on earth is in jeopardy (See Revelation 12:1-12.) After his dupes on earth have set up his deceptive arrangement on earth we may not be surprised to hear in the near future the prophets of demonism or religion saying more loudly than ever before: “Peace and safety!” Then sudden destruction shall come upon them, “and they shall not escape ”—1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No power aside from Jehovah’s can now avert Armageddon, and He will not avert it. The Devil’s organization must fall' to make way for the kingdom of righteousness God’s prophet, describing the great and terrible day of the Lord and the waves of that trouble dashing to pieces Satan’s organization, says: “They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. Then they [the men of good-will] cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet, so he bringeth them [the Armageddon survivors] unto their desired haven.”-Ps. 107 26-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great tribulation will so humble the hearts of those that seek meekness and righteousness that they will cry unto the Lord and he will lift them up and establish peace, lasting peace, on earth. “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow, and eutteth the spear in sunder; he buraeth the chariot (of war] in the fire.” (Ps. 46:9) Jesus has declared that this shall be the last trouble; and then with Jehovah’s Theocratic Government established “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”. (Isa. 2:4) The Prince of Peace in charge, and with the government upon his shoulder, there shall be no end of peace. Then shall the people of good-will be led forth with peace and they shall rejoice and be glad.—Isa. 55:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the time of Jesus’ birth there was little good-will toward God among men. A similar condition exists today. Selfishness predominates and controls the thoughts and actions of men. Selfishness and good-will do not harmonize. Good-will means that one’s purpose toward another is for good and that one desires to see his fellow man blessed with goodness, peace, prosperity, and that he takes a keen delight in doing anything that will result to the glory of Jehovah God and in good to his neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But are there no people of good-will now on earth? Yes; there are some, but they are in minority. There is a multitude without number that have an honest desire to see peace, prosperity and happiness amongst the people, but they have been so long misled and mistaught by religion that they are in confusion and know not which course to take. These have a desire for better conditions but find no way to express it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now the time has come for the anointed witnesses of Jehovah together with their faithful earthly companions to lift up the standard of the Lord for such people of goodwill and to aid and comfort and strengthen them that they may see the right way and rally to it. The King of The Theocracy is here and has begun his reign in the midst of his enemies, and now the people must take sides either for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government or for Satan’s organization. The great battle of Armageddon is approaching. Those of honest heart, who are therefore possessed of a measure of good-will, should be advised of Jehovah’s purpose that they may take the right course. It is the privilege of the witnesses of Jehovah to point all such to the Kingdom, to remove from the minds of such people the false doctrines taught them by religion or demonism, and to aid them to see the way of righteousness and holiness. The people must learn righteousness, but they will not learn it unaided.—Zeph. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prophecy sung by the angels at Jesus’ birth is now beginning to have its fulfillment. The first part of that prophecy is to honor and glorify the name of Jehovah. That will be done in the great time of trouble at Armageddon, which is impending. The next step is the establishment of everlasting peace, and this will be done when Satan is destroyed, and the “men of good-will” preserved. It is the privilege of the Christians to see this order of events now, to profit by it, to take their stand unequivocally on the Lord’s side, and to always have in mind the words of Jehovah: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) Consecrated Christians must be the true and faithful witnesses of the Lord God There has never before been such an important time for this to be done as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such Christians can have no sympathy with or part in the Devil’s organization. As representatives of the Lord it is now their privilege to comfort those that mourn by pointing them to Zion, Jehovah’s Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>HERO-WORSHIP A SNARE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font2">NE of the Devil’s favorite methods to accomplish the destruction of a creature is to turn the mind of the creature away from the great Creator. This the Devil does by inducing the creature to laud, magnify or worship </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anything</span><span class="font2"> other than God, and to forget God. Hence the study of God and his works is the only safe course for man. Many creatures worship the Devil. It is the policy of the Devil to induce others to worship some creature, in order that their minds may be turned away from Jehovah God. Always keep this fact in mind. To accomplish his purpose the Devil not only resorts to fraud, but induces others to become hypocrites. He began this practice in the days of Adam’s grandson Enos, when he induced men at that time to call themselves by the name of the Lord, who in truth and in fact were the dupes of the Devil. (See Genesis 4: 26, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">margin.}</span><span class="font2"> The cunning and wicked policy of the Devil is here disclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At all times the Devil has practiced this method of deceit upon mankind. It is only necessary to glance at the history of the great religious system operating out from Vatican City to see that the people of that system have at all times been induced to honor, worship and magnify the names of men rather than the name of Jehovah God. Some of the leaders in this great system, even though very wicked in their day, have afterwards been canonized as “saints” and thereby made objects of worship by the deluded people. Members of the Papal system, even though honest and sincere, are induced to worship images and men, and to pray to Mary and to address her as “the mother of God”. The Devil himself induces this to keep the people in his snare</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same condition has existed at all times in the Protestant system. The names of Arius, Calvin, Luther, Wesley, and numerous others, are recorded with reverence, and their sayings are quoted as authority, even though in direct contradiction to the Word of God. Members of the Protestant church have stood in great fear and reverence of these men and their memories. Many have put their trust in these men instead of trusting in the Lord God. For this reason they have exposed themselves to the snare of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Proverbs 29:25 says: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font2"> shall be safe.” Here the word “fear” means “trembling”, and is from the same Hebrew root as the word in Isaiah 66: 2, 5 : “Saith the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord:</span><span class="font2"> but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trembleth</span><span class="font2"> at my word. Hear the word of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font2"> ye that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tremble</span><span class="font2"> at his word.” This denotes a fear of Jehovah. Psalm 111: 10 says: “The fear of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font2"> is the beginning of wisdom.” This means that a reverential fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the reverential fear or dread of man is a snare of the Devil, to turn man away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan began to operate this scheme in the early days of the Christian church. Then the congregation at Corinth, Greece, was divided because of trouble. Some said: ‘I am of Apollos.’ Others said: ‘Paul is the mighty one who brought me into the truth.’ This condition caused the apostle, under inspiration, to write to the church at Corinth and say to them in substance: ‘Apollos and I are merely servants being used to bring the truth to you. It is God who gives you the knowledge and the increase. We are merely laborers with you and with God. You are God’s building. Selfconstituted wise men will appear among you and tell you what to do, but do not be deceived by them. Such wisdom as they manifest is foolishness in the sight of God. Let no man glory in men. God, the great Creator, is entitled to all honor and glory. The adoration and worship of men, and the practice of calling them great heroes, is the Devil’s scheme to turn away the minds of men from God.’—See 1 Corinthians. 1:10-13 ; 3 : 5-7, 9, 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The church has never been free from this subtle influence of the enemy. It is not unusual for some man, prominent in a congregation, to be exalted amongst the others. He possesses, possibly, more than the ordinary ability; he shows much devotion to the Lord, and the Lord uses him. Some of his special admirers give him much glory and honor. He loves the adulation and receives it gladly from his brethren ; he begins to t</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hink</span><span class="font2"> more highly of himself than he should think, and his brethren have their minds upon him as a great example and forget to look to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This course persisted in results in defilement of the temple of God, according to 1 Corinthians 3:17. The one who receives the plaudits of the others usually becomes impressed with his own importance, takes himself too seriously, becomes proud, and makes himself an easy victim of the Devil’s scheme. Hence Proverbs 16:18 states: “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” The worship of heroes, whether in the church or out of it, is surely of the Devil. It is the enemy’s scheme to turn man away from God, by inducing man to reverence some other man; and thereby many fall into the Devil’s snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is nothing that man has done or can do that is worthy of glory. If he has a clear understanding of the truth, and expresses it for the benefit of others, he is not entitled to any credit or glory therefor, lien should view themselves in the right light, and not think of themselves too highly. When compared with the greatness of God and his higher creation, man is a very insignificant thing When the psalmist David thought upon the mighty creation of God he exclaimed: “When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him<sup>?</sup> and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” (Ps 8: 3, 4) This is a proper view of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let no servant of God glory in his own wisdom, nor deceive himself nor be deceived by glorying in some other man’s wisdom or greatness. No truly great men have ever lived on earth since Jesus’ time. It is unsafe to magnify the names of men. Men are never so wise that they can glory in their own wisdom, and no man is so wise that he is entitled to the glory and reverence from other men. “Thus saith the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font2"> Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font2"> which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.”</span><span class="font2">—Jer. 9:23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The servants of Jehovah God now see that God resists the proud ones who pose as heroes, and likewise turns his face from those who are hero-worshipers. They see that he shows his favor to the obedient ones, because these are earnestly desirous of being in harmony with his holy will These see it is their privilege now to be his witnesses, and to declare his name and his glory in the earth. As his witnesses these faithful ones the great Jehovah God bids to go and tell the glad news to the sorrowing world, and to advise mankind that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus is the King of kings, and that the day of deliverance is at hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In obedience to the divine command let the Christians magnify the name of Jehovah God, lift up his standard for the people, and point them to the way that leads to life and endless joy. It is the solemn duty of each one to encourage every other one with whom he comes in contact to magnify and worship Jehovah God. Honor the Creator and not the creature. Stand shoulder to shoulder and help each other to stand. The proper study of mankind is God and his works God’s anointed servants must set this example, because Jehovah has said: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Due to the shortage in metal we are unable to get sufficient quantities of stitcher wire to put two stitches in magazines and booklets. To persons keeping permanent files of magazines we suggest that they sew the loose ends with thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As soon as sufficient wire can be obtained for double-stitching instead of single-stitching the magazines will be produced that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IN ENGLISH CITY AND COUNTRYSIDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We arranged for a public meeting at the British Legion Hall, Marston. The people were invited by printed leaflets, and then a week before the meeting we received a card to say, owing to unforeseen circumstances we could not have the Hall. The secretary later stated the reason to be ‘You are all C.O.’s; we don’t have anything to do with “pacifists”? We continued with the advertising, and on the day of the meeting we gained permission to use a small piece of ground at the side of the Legion Hall which belonged to the hotel next door. The meeting was arranged to begin at 3: 30 p.m. At 3 :15 the Legion officials with two police officers arrived and stood outside the Hall. At 3:30 p.m. booklets were given to the public, some of whom sat on the grass outside the hotel, and the lecture began. Three parts through the lecture the Legionnaires disappeared one by one; the message was getting too hot for them, and then Judge Rutherford mentioned how some of the police joined with the American Legion to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, and the police disappeared too. We had an attendance of 40. After the lecture was over a news reporter said: ‘You people have got a name that stinks, but I don’t know why.’ He kept the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font2"> and took a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font2"> The action of the Legion helped to advertise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Gloucestershire: “In the heart of the country I arranged a model study with an elderly lady and showed her the privilege of witnessing for Jehovah; even though she was living alone she could witness to tradespeople, etc. Calling back a fortnight later for the model study I was surprised to find I was sent for by two persons living on a neighboring farm. They wished to know what this was all about that Miss------has been telling them. I put on</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the phonograph recording and told them of the Kingdom. When I had finished (1£ hours), one said she had been a religionist all her life and ‘Why had she not heard of this before?’ I left, placing five bound books and a Bible, and returned to carry out the model study with Miss------.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the ladies from the farm came with me. She was so thrilled with the study that she asked if I could leave the phonograph to play to others, and could I please bring the rest of the lecture ‘Government and Peace’. I returned to the farm a day or so later with the records, and she has ordered a whole set of the books and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">'Yearbook for</span><span class="font2"> 1941, and has already been witnessing with the aid of the phonograph in the neighboring houses. I found Miss------had</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">spent over twelve hours’ witnessing in ten days, without going a few yards from home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AT PIMA INDIAN RESERVATION, ARIZONA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Pima tribe are very kind people, but, like others, they are kept in the dark through religionists. I was playing the phonograph at one place when a Catholic priest stuck his head through a window and with rude voice ordered every listener out of the place, leaving me all by myself. He tried to stir up the Indians against me, telling them I was an impostor, not appointed by the State .and therefore not desired in the Reservation. For the sake of those present I answered him that they have kept the people in the dark long enough and it was the Lord’s due time to expose the racket. This enraged him and he started to call for the police, seeing that the Indians were not willing to do his bidding. My wife, working in the other end of town, and I succeeded in working the entire Reservation. We placed much literature and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription When we worked the Reservation the second time I called on the superintendent. He said: ‘Are you the man that disturbs and brings so much strife to the Indians and preaches against their religion?’ I was told I couldn’t do this work unless I had permission from the Council; otherwise I would be taken from the Reservation by force. I told him I was willing to face any of the complainers (who were the priest and the minister, and not the Indians, which fact he did not deny) and that we will keep on with our work without a permit according to our constitutional rights and he would be responsible if anything would happen to us. I had a nice opportunity to give him a good witness. Before I left he took </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Keligion</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State. </span><span class="font2">He thanked me and promised to investigate. When we came to the place where we placed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription the lady gave us a warm welcome, saying: ‘I have been wishing with all my heart for you to come back. We have studied the books and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and fully realize this is the truth; my husband and I want to go in this work too, and we want to know if the Society will give us the permission. We know they will not like it in the Reservation, but we would like to do this work anyhow. We are poor, but we put aside $5 for you to get all the books and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.'</span><span class="font2"> We gave her a Testimony card and a bag with ammunition, and two days later she had already gone out by herself, joyfully.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE THE HIERARCHY’S WORD IS LAW (NEW MEXICO)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Two pioneers were warned at police headquarters to not continue distributing magazines on the street, or else —! The papers next day boasted in bold-face type on the front page that ‘two Jehovah’s witnesses had been given the bum’s rush, and at last reports were seen leaving town for points unknown’. (To their trailer parked by the edge of town was where they went.) The following Tuesday their ear was ticketed for improper parking at a place with no parking limit signs. On going early to the police station to present the chief with the very important message in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font2"> the chief said to them: ‘Yes, I have a very important message for you, too’—and into jail they went without a chance to say a word. The parking ticket was a pure frame-up, a bait to entice them into the ‘cage’. Other publishers missed them and sent word to near-by Albuquerque, from where the zone servant, company servant and another came to their rescue. With foreheads harder than adamant these three sought a copy of the complaint from the police magistrate. The zone servant, spokesman for the group, carried a large reddish manila envelope such as lawyers use. They caused the magistrate to become very jittery and unusually courteous. In tearful tone he consulted over the phone with the prosecuting attorney, admitting, in the brethren’s presence, that there was no evidence nor witnesses against those in jail, though they were to be given a choice of $90, or 90 days, or leave town. As things developed, the two pioneers were released within fifteen minutes. Now the work is respected more than ever there, and the brethren are regularly on the streets with the magazines, unmolested.&quot;</span></p>

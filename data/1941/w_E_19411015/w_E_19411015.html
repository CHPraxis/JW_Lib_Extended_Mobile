<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death In order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DEMON RULE ENDING</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judcea flee to the mountains” —Mark 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TEHOVAH caused Daniel his prophet to write a I prophetic description of the “abomination that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font7"> maketh desolate”, and later the Lord Jesus shows that such prophecy would have its fulfillment at the end of the world, when he, as King of The Theocracy, would take his power and reign. The Lord Jesus not only corroborates the prophecy of Daniel as authentic, but he gives warning, telling all persons of good-will what course they must take to find safety after that abominable thing is set up. (Matt. 24:15) The facts and the prophecy further show that the present is the time of fulfillment and the time to heed the warning. Now the prophecy is in course of fulfillment and the Lord reveals to those who will understand that the ‘desolating abomination’ is Satan’s substitute for The Theocracy, which abominable thing is set up by Satan’s religious agent, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, which claim the right to rule the world. At this point Christ Jesus says to all persons of good-will: “Whoso readeth, let him understand.” (Matt. 24:15) Who shall understand? The Lord God, by his prophet, answers: “None of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” (Dan. 12:10) Those who are of good-will toward God and his King will now be diligent to read intelligently the prophecy, together with the statement of the physical facts showing a fulfillment of the prophecy. Such will take the wise course by immediately fleeing from Satanic or demon rule and “flee to the mountains”, which mountains symbolically refer to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah by his anointed King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•DESOLATING ABOMINATION’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Returning now to the examination of Daniel 11:31: “And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.” Further physical facts are here submitted, which show the steps taken to place “the abomination that maketh desolate” “where it ought not” to be; to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Berlin, November 25,1936, Germany and Japan signed an agreement, which is technically directed against Communism, but the real purpose of which has a far wider scope. The Papacy for several years has held up Communism as a great scarecrow to induce others to support Catholic Action and to draw the people into Satan’s trap, and, without doubt, the smooth and subtle hand of the present pope did much toward the formation of that agreement between Germany and Japan last above mentioned. On November 6, 1937, Italy joined in that pact, supposed to be against Communism, but in fact a furtherance of the scheme or conspiracy for world dominion. Then in the same year, and almost immediately thereafter, Italy announced withdrawal from the League of Nations, which League “the king of the south” had brought forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then on March 12, 1938, Hitler proclaimed the union of Austria with Germany, and Cardinal Innitzer, authoritative representative of the pope, gave public assurance to Hitler that Austrian Catholics fully and loyally supported Hitler; and Hitler becomes the creator of the so-called “Holy Germanic Reich of the Teutonic Nationality”. Hitler has announced that the Holy Roman Catholic-German Empire must be re-established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On May 7, 1939, Germany and Italy announced that they would sign an open political and military alliance as a result of a conference between their foreign ministers at Rome. Whether the pope sat in on that conference is not disclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On August 24, 1939, Hitler diplomatically outwitted “the king of the south” by entering into and signing with Russia a ten-year non-aggression pact, which both governments ratified. Hitler, in keeping with his demon father, did not live up to that nonaggression pact, but broke it and attacked Russia, and the Papacy approves Hitler’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">putsch</span><span class="font7"> against Russia, Communism being given as an excuse for such approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1940 the German </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blitzkrieg</span><span class="font7"> is carried on against Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Holland, all with the sanction of the Papacy. In June the same year Paris falls; and a life-long representative of the Roman</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholic Hierarchy is made the arbitrary ruler of unoccupied France. Then in July, 1940, France ceased to be a republic in name even, and Marshal Petain, the Catholic friend and ally of the pope, became the “Chief of State”, both as premier and president, to collaborate with Nazi Germany. The very next month following, that is to say, August 22,1940, at Fulda, Germany, the Catholic bishops voted to pledge allegiance to Hitler, giving effusive thanks at the same time to his armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> In Japan Jehovah’s witnesses are all behind prison bars because they told the truth about The Theocratic Government, and their imprisonment is the result of Roman Catholic Hierarchy action. September 17,1940, Japan announced itself a Fascist State. Ten days later Germany, Italy and Japan signed a mutual assistance pact, pledging co-operation with each other for ten years. November 20,1940, the construction of the New League of Nations, the rule of earth by dictators, proceeding according to “the king of the north”, was signed at Vienna, Austria. That was a formal alliance between Hungary and Germany, Italy and Japan, and in which alliance Rumania, a few days thereafter, joined. In line with that further movement of “the king of the north” to set up or place the “abomination of desolation”, or “New Order”, in Europe, note the following utterances of the Papacy, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">November 24,1940, Pope Pius XII by radio broadcast from Vatican City prays that “there be set up an order of [nations] more just and more harmonious ... an order that would tend to give to every people in tranquillity, in liberty, and in security, that portion of the earthly source of prosperity and power which belongs to each, so as to make possible the fulfillment of the words of the Creator, ‘Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.’ ” Regarding this the responsible Italian authority says that ‘the pope understands the Axis powers’ [Germans’ and Italians’] aspirations, and that he echoes the aims of the Axis powers’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* As touching the duplicity and hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and further showing their direct connection with the Axis powers, and hence their forming a part of “the king of the north”, which is bent on world dominion, and which is “the abomination that maketh desolate”, note the following written by an English writer under the nom de plume of David Wilkie, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Hitler became chancellor, thanks to the papist von Papen; and he became the ‘constitutional’ dictator of Germany, thanks to the papist Centre Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Murders of June 30, 1934</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Hitler’s next task was to remove from office in the party every sincere Nazi who could by his position or prestige influence policy, and who was not prepared to sell Germany, or betray it, to the general of the Jesuits. This was accomplished on June 30, when about 100 Brownshirt officers were massacred (by Blackshirts), and also a number of non-Nazi patriots were dealt with, such as General Duesterberg and General von Schleicher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Pope Behind the Scenes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Broadcasting to Britishers on July 3, a Mr. Crossman, an eyewitness of the scenes during the Hitler murders, said that whenever he had spoken to the German people, from Munich to Berlin, all, without exception, told him the same thing, i.e., that ‘the pope was behind the whole of the trouble’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To bear witness that the Nazi party was on the wane when the conspiracy which made Hitler chancellor took place, listen to the following accounts of eyewitnesses, a Russian social democrat, a biographer of Nazism, and a French Marxian Communist. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Germany ‘Saved’ for the Jesuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Jesuits saw Germany, and their vision of the ‘Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire, slipping from their claws. ‘Down with Democracy! Down with Tolerance ! Up Murder! Up Dictatorship!’ Von Papen and Hitler ‘saved’ Germany for the Jesuits, just as Mussolini ‘saved’ Italy for ‘the Holy Church’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“‘Fascism’ (meaning ‘Nazism’ too), wrote Ludendorff in his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming War,</span><span class="font7"> ‘is a fighting instrument of the pope.’ ‘Fascism is the offspring of the Jesuits.’ ‘The ways of the Church of Rome and Fascism are identical.’ ‘The Papacy and Fascism are inseparably united: together they constitute what is called “Rome”. . . . ’ “What astonishes me is that the fact should have been overlooked that national socialism of the Fascist type merely means collectivism of the Romish brand.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">flatteries</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> “And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.” (Dan. 11: 32) It is the political element of “the king of the north” that is here named as influencing others by flatteries, wickedly doing what is possible against the covenant, that is to say, The Theocratic Government. The political element of “the king of the north” flatters the religious element, that is to say, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by promising to fulfill the dream of the Papacy to revive and set up again the so-called “Holy Roman Empire”. In this the political element of the composite “king of the north” serves as the active ruling power, and thus serves as the pope’s implement to bring about the desired result. To be sure, the Axis political powers do not love the Papacy, but join forces with the Papacy, moved by selfish desire and hope or expectation of ruling the world. The political element expects and relies upon the religious element, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to keep the Catholic population submissive while the scheme of world dominion is carried forward to completion. The Papacy willingly joins in the conspiracy or scheme for world domination and lends large sums of money and ecclesiastical backing and employs Catholic Action in co-operating with the political element to bring about the desired end. Supporting this conclusion, take note of the following facts, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Mussolini became dictator of Italy he was against the pope. Catholic Action was put forward by Pope Pius XI, and shortly thereafter Mussolini became a devout Catholic and made regular trips to the Vatican to have his conscience oiled. Hitler and Mussolini, the two leading parts of the political element of “the king of the north”, had an understanding with the pope, who had dealt with Hitler through his agents and Secretary Cardinal Pacelli and Monsignor Kaas. Fritz Thyssen, German steel magnate who helped finance Hitler to his position of political power, throws some light on the result of the flattery to which the pope yielded. Thyssen wrote a letter, which was widely published, concerning the deal between the pope and the dictators, from which the following is quoted: “The idea was to have a sort of Christian Corporate State organized according to the classes, which should be supported by the church—in the west by the Catholic, and in the east by the Protestant church—and by the army. . . . Hitler then promised what to me was the most important thing: not to touch the rights of the Catholic church. He repeated this promise in a long conversation with Monsignor Kaas, who paid him a visit, following an order of the then papal nuncio to Germany, Pacelli, now Pius XII, and this without knowledge of the leader of the Zentrum party [the Catholic party of Germany at that time], Chancellor Bruening. This conference led to the overthrow of the last legal German government, that of Bruening, and marked the beginning of the epoch of German and European policies which led to the second world war, of today.” The foregoing statement by Thyssen was published in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Arbeiter Zeitung</span><span class="font7"> of Basel, Switzerland. (See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> August 21,1940.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Hitler became dictator of Germany and on July 20, 1933, signed a formal concordat with the pope. Shortly thereafter the faithful servants of Jehovah, who announced The Theocracy within the land of Germany, were set upon by the Nazis, their property was seized, they were harshly ill-treated, and thousands of them imprisoned. Hitler’s Gestapo performed this act in carrying out Catholic Action.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>T</sup> The Papacy yielded to the flattery of the Nazis for the selfish purpose of gratifying a political aspiration, and entered into an agreement with the Nazis and made common cause with the dictators. Then the clergy or ecclesiastical element took a positive position against the covenant, that is, The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Thus the ecclesiastical element, the Hierarchy, became corrupt, as the prophecy states, in like manner that the Protestant religionists were corrupted and perverted respecting the League of Nations brought forth by “the king of the south” by the Versailles Treaty. The Papal clergy, by joining forces with the dictators, became a party to all the cruel and bloody crimes of the totalitarians, just as the Lord foretold by another of his prophets: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.” (Isa. 24:5) “Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” —Jer. 2: 33, 34.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> The Lord will cleanse the defiled land with the blood of the ones responsible for the present world disaster. (See Numbers 35:33.) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy had for many centuries claimed to be for the Covenant Government, The Theocracy, and had deceived millions of people and still deceives them; but when the time arrived to dissemble, that religious or demon institution chose “Caesar”, the State, instead of Christ the King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’Note the marginal reading of Daniel 11:32: “Cause to dissemble [that is, act hypocritically].” As to hypocritical action on the part of the flattering Roman Catholic Hierarchy, note the following: The public press of Germany on February 10, 1939, commented on the death of Pope Pius XI, who organized and started Catholic Action, and, amongst other things, said: “Although he [the pope] inveighed against Bolshevism, he also tried t,o come to terms with it in the hope of taking over the Russian Orthodox Church.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>10</sup> For some time prior to the assault of the Germans upon the Russians in the present war of 1941 the Vatican had Jesuit priests in Russia carrying on a systematic training work to gain control over the Russian Orthodox Church whenever Germany conquers Russia. This is further proof of the hypocrisy of the Vatican and of its co-operation with the Axis powers. The public press published these facts throughout the country, among which was that by the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">J ournal-American</span><span class="font7"> June 23, 1941, in which this statement concerning the Papacy says: “The Holy See has been training priests for duty in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Russia for some time in the event of a religious change there.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>11</sup> Further evidence of the hypocrisy of the Vatican is shown in the following; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Der Angriff,</span><span class="font7"> German newspaper, says: “As late as 1936 the pope issued permission to Catholics in Japan to participate in the cult of the Emperor and of the heroes, ‘leaving Weltanschauung to the State and religion to the church.’ ” In all the political operations of “the king of the north” in recent years the Vatican has dissembled or acted hypocritically before the Catholic population in order to hide the facts, which facts show that the Papacy is fully co-operating with the Axis powers in carrying forward a campaign for world domination.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>12</sup> The Vatican is now especially acting hypocritically in England and with her allies, which are at war with “the king of the north”; and in that so-called “democratic” nation the Vatican representatives claim to be democratic and to be strongly supporting democracies and that the Vatican is being persecuted by the totalitarians, which claim, of course, is exactly contrary to the facts and is put forth for the express purpose of deceiving the common people and keeping them blind as to the real duplicity of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. God foreknew and foretold of such dissembling or hypocrisy in these appropriate words: “An hypocrite with his mouth de-stroyeth his neighbour.” (Prov. 11:9) The Vatican has played and continues to play the hypocritical game with reference to Belgium, Holland and other countries, where it carries on “fifth column” action. It follows the same tactics in the United States, claiming to be for America, yet dead against all democracies and scheming to grab control of the United States government.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The Hierarchy resort to flattery of the democracies, telling the officials thereof that they are the “higher powers” named in the Scriptures at Romans 13:1, and thus throw the democracy-deluded ones off their guard and blind them to the facts. The above scripture means that only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are “the Higher Powers” and that in no sense whatsoever are political office-holders the higher powers. The political elements have also flattered the religious element by high compliments and by refraining from criticising the Hierarchy and its methods of duplicity; and these political powers have seen to it that the public press does not criticize the Hierarchy nor even mention its glaring and crooked action.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>14</sup> The demon trap of flattery has been working steadily, and into it the so-called “democracies” have been successfully caught. As an example: When the Papacy announced 1933 the “Holy Year”, Protestants and Jewish religionists and politicians joined with the Hierarchy in ceremonies celebrating the year and felicitating the pope and other members of the Hierarchy and expressing the hope that ‘a golden stream of prosperity would flow to the people by reason of the actions of the Papacy’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>15</sup> A few examples of the foregoing follow:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">On October 8,1936, the presidential campaign was on, and Pacelli, the present pope, suddenly turned up in the United States and had a private visit with the then candidate for re-election, Mr. Roosevelt. When the votes were counted, Mr. Roosevelt had gotten most of the Catholic vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Roosevelt had stated that the United States would enter into diplomatic relationship with the Vatican as soon as the American people could be brought around to it. Becoming impatient in waiting for the American people to come around to that state of mind, Mr. Roosevelt, on December 23, 1939, appointed Myron C. Taylor as his personal envoy to the pope, and Mr. Taylor proceeded to Vatican City to felicitate the Papal head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">September, 1940, there was celebrated throughout the world the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Order of Jesuits, and the United States joined in that celebration. All fair-minded people know that the Jesuits are the most hypocritical and crooked Order that the Devil has ever placed on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> In this 32nd verse of the eleventh chapter of Daniel’s prophecy Jehovah by his prophet draws a striking contrast between the enemies of The Theocracy, that yield to flattery and do wickedly against The Theocracy, and those who faithfully support The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The latter, the faithful ones, are designated in the prophecy as God’s people; that is to say: “The people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.” That means the faithful servants of Jehovah who engage, by his grace, in God’s “strange work”. These do know their God and rejoice in serving him. Such are Jehovah’s witnesses, to whom Jehovah has been pleased in recent years to reveal himself and his purposes in order that they might serve him as his witnesses by bearing testimony to his name and to his kingdom. In 1919 Jehovah brought his faithful people back from captivity and the dead state or condition, where they had been held by modern Babylon. He revived them and put them to work in his service. He has made known to them that he is the Supreme One, the Almighty God, who alone bears the name Jehovah. (Ezek. 37:13,14) He has made them to know that Christ Jesus is the King of The Theocracy, who shall rule the world in righteousness, and that his government is the most important of all matters. He has set them free from religion and has shown them that human salvation is not of greatest importance, but that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is of paramount importance; and thus has made known to them what is the joy of the Lord. These faithful ones have entered into the joy of the Lord at the invitation of Christ Jesus. God has made known to these faithful servants the meaning of the ‘two great wonders’ in the heavens (Rev. 12:1-3), that is to say, Jehovah’s organization, which is supreme, and that organization which is operated by the Devil in opposition to The Theocracy. God has shown his people what constitutes the “beast” and the “image of the beast”, that is, the totalitarian monstrosity. (Rev. 15:2) Jehovah has revealed to his people the meaning of his prophecies and has made them “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might”. He has made them strong in faith and in works and to stand up against the totalitarian forces of the demons, and to refuse to have anything in common with the covenant-breaking religionists. God has made them strong to stick to and to proclaim The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus his King.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>17</sup> Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses, as the prophecy states, “do exploits.” They have, by the grace of God and his King, been active in declaring Jehovah’s name and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and in declaring Jehovah’s judgments written against every element of Satan’s organization. Thus they have done a work and accomplished something in God’s name. This they have done particularly since the outpouring of the holy spirit in A.D. 1922. By the Lord’s grace these faithful servants of his “do know their God” and have gone forth in the strength of the Lord and have carried his message to practically all nations of the earth. They have printed and published the Kingdom message, world-wide, in eighty-eight different languages and dialects, which publications in those languages they have placed in the hands of the people to the number of more than 340 million books and booklets, and in addition thereto many millions of free tracts, besides magazines, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age, Consolation;</span><span class="font7"> they have also broadcast over hundreds of radio transmitters to countless numbers of radio audiences, proclaiming the good news of The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, which is the bright and glorious hope of humankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses within that time have held the greatest assemblies or conventions of God’s people that have ever been held within the history of the church. As an example, in London in 1938 there was a large convention assembled, with forty-six other assemblies throughout the earth tied together by land wires with the main convention, together with 117 radio stations, which simultaneously broadcast the Kingdom message from London.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">”In June, 1939, thirty different assemblies were likewise held, united with New York by land wires, together with 75 radio stations, proclaiming the kingdom message; in which multitudes of people heard.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> In Detroit in July, 1940, there was a main assembly of the convention, with seventeen other American cities connected together by land wires, and by radio, who participated in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. In addition thereto numerous petitions concerning the kingdom of Jehovah God have been circulated and signed by millions of people, calling upon the nations to hear and to support the freedom of speech and freedom of worship of AlmightyGod. In the courts of the nations thousands of cases have been tried, in which public testimony<sup>7</sup> has been given to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Many of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have been haled into the courts at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their dupes, exactly in fulfillment of the prophetic warning uttered by Christ Jesus, and thus a further witness has been given to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom: “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. And the gospel must first be published among all nations.” (Mark 13: 9,10) Mark the facts showing fulfillment of the prophecy of Daniel, which are here corroborated by the words prophetically uttered by Christ Jesus; and mark well also in this connection the physical facts that follow.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the wise</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>21</sup> “And they that understand [they that be wise </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{Rev. Ver.)]</span><span class="font7"> among the people shall instruct many ; yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.”—Dan. 11: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> Thus the Lord God and Christ Jesus caused the light to shine into the hearts of his faithful people, giving them an understanding of their own relationship to Jehovah and to his King, and those who really love The Theocratic Government have rejoiced to receive this light and have taken the wise course: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments ; his praise endureth for ever.”—Ps. Ill: 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> The wise one is he who hears and obeys the admonition of the Lord. From and after A.D. 1922 the knowledge and understanding and wisdom of these faithful servants of Jehovah increased. Since then the wise have devoted themselves to the interest of The Theocratic Government and the Lord has made them a part of his “faithful and wise servant” of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (Matt. 24:45-47) Daniel’s prophecy concerning the awakening from the dust and much running to and fro, which for a long while was grossly misunderstood and misinterpreted, began to be properly understood by the wise ones after the coming of the Lord to his temple: “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.”—Dan. 12: 2,3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>24</sup> It is those who take the wise course that increase in understanding and rejoice in the Lord. (Dan. 12:10) Many who were spiritually asleep prior to 1931 and were in the “dust” of Babylon until the Lord awakened them, when awakened, began to realize the importance of the hour and, becoming alive to that importance, they went to work, joyfully going forth to have a part, and having a part, in God’s “strange work”. The number of the pioneers rapidly increased; and those in the many companies that have been spiritually asleep, yet who had love for God, awakened and seized the opportunity of going from house to house to bring the testimony to the people concerning the name of the Most High and his kingdom. Such have become faithful witnesses of the Lord and have carried his message to those who have been hungering and thirsting for righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>25</sup> “Shall instruct many,” says the prophecy concerning Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. These faithful servants of the Lord heard and understood the command of Christ Jesus: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness” before the final end. (Matt. 24:14) In obedience to the Lord’s commandment here given the faithful diligently went about telling the people of and concerning The Theocratic Government. They have become instructors of many by visiting them at their homes and by holding study meetings and aiding them in studying God’s Word. Such has been and is a tremendous witness work and carried on in divers ways, to wit, by the use of books, booklets, magazines, radio, phonographs, and by traveling from place to place and from house to house and speaking to those who are willing to hear. As these faithful witnesses have gone among the people they have met with many who have had a hearing ear, and these the witnesses have instructed in the way of the Scriptures. Their journey and their work as Jehovah’s servants are along the rough and rugged way, viewed from the human viewpoint, but always the way of joy of heart to those who willingly engage in the field witness work. It is not expected it would be easy on the human organism. It has not been too hard for all, and it has been too hard for some. Therefore says the prophecy:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“YET THEY SHALL FALL.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">*’ According to the Hebrew this part of the text reads: &quot;They shall totter in their knees”; (Leeser) “yet they will stumble.” But mark this, that they do not fall down helplessly. They have not stopped pushing forward in Jehovah’s service. The pioneers and company workers have had many difficulties, but on they have gone. They know that they are backed up by almighty power, Jehovah and his King, and therefore, when hindered by the enemy and caused to stumble, they rise up again and go forward: “For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief.”—Prov. 24 :16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“YET THEY SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>iT</sup> In the totalitarian land this part of the prophecy has been literally fulfilled, as the faithful servants of Jehovah have experienced. There some of the faithful have refused to compromise with the demon organization, and these have been put to death, symbolized by “the sword”; some of them literally being beheaded. The word “sword” is also a symbol of violent opposition and persecution waged against the faithful ones by mobs controlled by demons. This has also been the result in many parts of the earth, particularly in the United States, where these have been led by Jesuit priests, deluded members of the American Legion, and other demonized fanatics. The Lord foreknew that these things would come to pass, and caused it to be written down for the comfort of his people who experience them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“BY FLAME”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> The flame here symbolizes hot persecution and public roasting by newspapers, by radio addresses, by public misrepresentation and by false testimony in the courts. From these sources flames of malicious persecution have flared forth against Jehovah’s witnesses. (Lam. 2:3) Against such scorching flames the faithful have stood firm, refusing to yield to any part of the demonized organization. These faithful ones are deeply rooted in the truth and in their devotion to God and his King, and are not like the seed that was sown on stony ground, that “when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away”.—Matt. 13: 5, 6, 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“BY CAPTIVITY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>28</sup> Thus are described other things that have been used by the demon-controlled to hinder the servants of Jehovah, that is, his faithful witnesses. These witnesses have been taken into captivity, physically, in the totalitarian-ruled countries, where they have been physically dragged and thrown into prison. In Germany more than 6,000 of such faithful witnesses of Jehovah have been placed at one time in prison, and many still linger in such prisons. Many have been arrested and thrown into prisons throughout the United States, in the land long boasted of as “the land of the free, and the home of the brave”, which land and its religionist-controlled officers in recent years have yielded to the totalitarian, demon spirit made manifest by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. All of such related wickedness, leveled against Jehovah’s witnesses, is in fulfillment of the prophecy ; and knowing that Jehovah permits the same for a purpose, his faithful servants joyfully endure such suffering and persecution for his name's sake, knowing that in due time he will avenge them.-Luke 18:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“AND BY SPOIL”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>30</sup> From the time that the dictator Hitler came into power in Germany that land has been a place of spoiling of God’s faithful people. The dictator agents, and agents of the Hierarchy, have invaded private homes of Jehovah’s witnesses and there, without any just cause or excuse, have seized the inmates of those homes and carried them away to prison, have seized Bibles and Bible literature, and have burned the same. On one occasion 50,000 books of Jehovah’s witnesses were destroyed in flames by the Nazis. A similar course has been followed by the dictatorial rulers in other countries that form a part of “the king of the north”, to wit, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Rumania, France, Spain, and other places, all of which has been wickedly done with the connivance and at the instance of the Hierarchy, directed from Vatican City.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>31</sup> In Canada the spoiling goes on. There Jehovah’s witnesses, the servants of the Most High, have been declared by the Catholic Vatican-controlled dictator to be an “illegal organization”, and their work and their property spoiled, and many arrests made because faithful servants of God meet together to talk over God’s gracious goodness provided for them. A like policy of spoiling is now carried on in many other countries, which form a part of “the king of the south”, to wit, Australia, West Africa, Island provinces, and other places.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>32</sup> In the United States, to the shame of the nation that for 150 years has held dear freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship of Almighty God, such spoiling work has run wild in recent years. It began particularly in the United States, as early as 1932; and in 1940, on the same day that the dictator Mussolini, with the connivance of the Vatican, stabbed the republic of France in the back, the spoiling broke out in Texas and in other places, where Catholic, demonized persons predominated, and there mobs were led by Roman Catholic priests and other Catholic fanatics, who entered private Bible student classes, and their homes were seized, and their Bibles and other Bible literature, and destroyed. Also they maliciously beat and violently ill-treated many Jehovah’s witnesses, destroying their property and driving them from place to place like wild beasts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>88</sup> “Catholic Action,” organized and directed by and from Vatican City, is the chief instrument of Satan and associated demons in carrying on the spoiling of Jehovah’s servants in different parts of the earth. Referring to this matter, the prophecy says it is carried on for “many days”, and those days are almost certain to continue with increased venom and violence, manifested by the religionists against Jehovah’s servants until the Lord takes a hand in that battle of the great day of God Almighty called “Armageddon”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>34</sup> By these wicked means named in the prophecy, sward, flames, captivity and spoiling, Catholic Action, which is a part of “the king of the north”, hopes to bring about a condition in the world when the religionists, their leaders and allies may say to one another: “We are at peace and safety.” That will be the sign when the Lord will move into action and clear up the demon agents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>35</sup> Through all the cruel persecution suffered by Jehovah’s witnesses at the hands of demon-controlled ruling elements these faithful servants of the Lord have managed to stumble along. Weary in body, yet rejoicing in spirit, they have gone forward singing the praises of The Theocracy and its King. Thus they continue to have part in the “strange work” of Jehovah. Onward they march like an irresistible swarm of locusts, fully determined that in the strength of the Lord they will perform their part of the covenant. Long ago Jehovah, by his prophet, foretold this onward march of his servants in these words: “They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks; neither shall one thrust another, they shall walk every one in his path; and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded [though in among the weapons they fall, they shall not stop </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)].”—^)</span><span class="font7"> 2:7,8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>86</sup> “Now when they shall fall [And when they stumble </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)],</span><span class="font7"> they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.” —Dan. 11: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>87</sup> The Lord here brings to view his “other sheep”, who sympathize with the “remnant” and show their goodness of heart by rendering assistance to the remnant. These “other sheep” are very small in number when compared with the host of the wicked persecutors, called “goats”. The “other sheep” are likened to those who became companions of David when he was outlawed and hunted by Saul. (1 Chron. 12:22-24) So David wrote: “The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.”—Ps. 118:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">*• They render aid as Rahab rendered aid to the spies. So these “other sheep” of the Lord have shown their goodness of heart towards God’s remnant. (Josh. 2:1,2) Likewise as Jael rendered help to Barak and Deborah at the battle of Megiddo. (Judg. 4:17-22; 5:24-27) The Lord has further pictured such help rendered by the Jonadabs, as shown in the relationship of Jonathan and David (1 Samuel 19,20,23); also as that shown by Ebed-melech in helping Jeremiah when he was in the pit. (Jer. 38:7-13) As the “other sheep” render help to the faithful remnant, so they render it unto Christ Jesus, of which He takes notice and administers to them a great blessing.—Matt. 25: 32-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” Some help is also rendered by reasonable and sensible judges of the courts who have rendered honest and sincere decisions upholding the rights of Jehovah’s witnesses in proclaiming the Kingdom message, and which decisions have had something to do with keeping the “back door” open for the remainder of the modern-Ehud class. (Judg. 3: 23-26) The attitude of the British government and many of its war draft boards has shown their kindness toward Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is here noteworthy. The Lord never overlooks kindness that is ministered to those who love and serve him. No doubt the judges referred to, who have rendered favorable and righteous decisions concerning Jehovah’s witnesses, and the officials of the British government who have shown kindness to Jehovah’s servants, will receive some just recompense from the Lord in due time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>40</sup> “But many shall cleave to them with flatteries.” There was an earlier representative of “the king of the north” in power when Jesus was on the earth in the flesh and who yielded to flatteries. (See Daniel 11: 21, 22.) Verse 32 of this eleventh chapter shows a later representative of “the king of the north” who is corrupted and who corrupts the so-called “clergy” by flatteries. The demons try their flattering schemes upon Jehovah’s witnesses. “The king of the north” and its agents and representatives thereby hope to corrupt Jehovah’s witnesses by inducing them to compromise with the Devil, such as Satan attempted to do to corrupt Christ Jesus at the mount of temptation. Some officials of “the king of the north”, particularly the diplomatic ones, try to induce Jehovah’s servants by flattery and flattering words to compromise by having part in creature worship and paying homage to creatures. The faithful refuse to yield, and pray as they are taught in God’s Word: “Lead me, 0 Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. Destroy thou them, 0 God; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.”— Ps. 5:8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>41</sup> There are flatterers amongst the “elective elder” class, who indulge in flattery themselves and who believe in flattering Satan’s organization by putting on the soft pedal when it comes to the Kingdom message and by recognizing political officials as the “higher powers” and yielding to their demands. The result is that such decline to have any part in proclaiming The Theocracy and the deadly conflict of Satan’s organization with God’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The evidence is therefore cumulative showing beyond all doubt that the composite “king of the north”, made up chiefly of political-religious elements, and demon-controlled, has boldly and blasphemously placed itself “in the holy place” and there it arrogantly stands in the place “where it ought not” to stand, in the place and stead of The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, and stands there in defiance of Almighty God. It is the present-day 'desolating abomination’, the instrument of Satan, the chief of demons, by which he would desolate the entire earth. Those who see and understand these truths will now give heed to the warning uttered by Christ Jesus the King and quickly flee to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, symbolized by “the mountains”.—Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>42</sup> At the same time those who have taken the wise course are being subjected to the severe test, and all who will come off victorious must continue to hold fast their integrity. Who of such will now appear blameless before the Lord in this hour of final testing ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{To be continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The works of Jehovah are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. His work is honor and majesty; and his righteousness endureth for ever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered . . .

The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments; his praise endureth for ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">I</span><span class="font5">N THIS trying world crisis “character development” and its claimed importance and necessity are repeatedly stressed from the public platform and the pulpit and over the radio. Said a Toronto, Canada, clergyman recently in New York: “Fighting and beating Hitler may involve the danger of becoming [totalitarian] like Hitler. We must return to the idea that the character of God determines our moral order.” (N. Y. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> July 21, 1941) Expressions also are frequent, such as: “We must in this life become a perfect character or else we cannot eternally dwell with God.” “Fitness of character to meet God’s approval must be accomplished while in the flesh. Death and resurrection will make no change in our character.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is “character”? The word in the Greek text of the Bible from which the English word “character” is taken appears but once in the Scriptures. The Greek word is there rendered “express image”, as follows: “Who being the brightness of his glory, and, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">express image</span><span class="font5"> of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.” (Heb. 1:3) This description of Christ Jesus relates to the time when he was resurrected and exalted to divine glory. The express image of the Father, which Jesus Christ now enjoys, is not something that he developed during his three and one-half years of suffering down on earth. The apostle, at Hebrews 1: 3, plainly says that Christ Jesus enjoyed this “express image” from the time when he “sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high”. This glory he did not acquire by his own efforts, but it came to him as a reward from God because of his absolute obedience and faithfulness and maintaining of his integrity toward Jehovah while on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This “express image”, or “character” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Greek),</span><span class="font5"> is not something that the glorified Jesus possesses separate and apart from his person. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> translation renders Hebrews 1:3 in this manner: “Who, being an effulgence of his glory, and an exact impress of his substance, and making manifest all things by the word of his power, having made a purification for sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty in high places.” From this it must be concluded that when Jesus was exalted on high he then became the “express image” of Jehovah his Father and that life divine or immortality has to do with that express image That being true, it was an absolute impossibility for Jesus to develop it while in the mortal flesh. The Greek word “character” means “the figure stamped in; an exact copy; express image”. (Strong's Concordance)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Character is that which a person or thing really is.” (Webster’s Dictionary) This definition is in harmony with the inspired Scriptures. It is true that in English usage the word “character” has many shades of meaning given to it by lexicographers, but usage by men can in no wise change the Scriptural meaning of a word or term. If the Lord through the inspired scribes plainly shows the meaning of a word used, then no man has authority to give that word a different meaning and then apply that meaning to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Frequently in religious circles these expressions are used, to wit, “God’s righteous character”; “Jesus’ character”; “the Christian’s character”; etc. Observe that in each</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">of these expressions the possessive case of the person is employed, meaning ownership or possession of something as separate and distinct from the person or creature. Does God possess a character separate and distinct from himself ? Does Jesus own and possess a character which is separate and distinct from himself and which he has developed ’ Has a Christian a character which he owns and possesses and which he develops by his own effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Webster further defines the Greek word rendered “character” in harmony with the Scriptures, thus • “The peculiar quality or the sum of qualities by which a person or thing is distinguished from others, that which a person or thing really is.” What distinguishes God from all others’ The answer must be that at all times, without beginning and without ending, the four primary attributes, wisdom and justice and love and power, are expressed by and in him in exact harmony. Such cannot be said of any other. Jehovah, therefore, is </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span><span class="font5"> Character. That being true, the expressions “God’s character” or “God’s righteous character” are unscriptural. These attributes are a part of Jehovah. He is </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span><span class="font5"> Character. He does not possess or own a character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of the creation of God’s only begotten Son, The Logos or Word, afterward called “Jesus”, he was always a character and he was always perfect. When God raised Jesus up out of death and clothed him with immortality and with all power in heaven and in earth and exalted him to the highest place in the heavens, he made Jesus Christ exactly like Himself, his “express image”. Therefore and from that time he is a character like Jehovah. This does not indicate that he possesses something which he developed and which is called “character”, but that he is a character and he is like his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man is a creature, an entity, a soul; as shown by the account of his creation, at Genesis 2:7: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">became</span><span class="font5"> a living soul.” There are many people on the earth who believe themselves to tie Christian and who use the expression, “I have a soul to save,” thereby meaning that they possess something called “a soul” and which is separate and distinct from the body. This is not Scriptural. No man possesses a soul separate and distinct from his body. Every man is a soul. Likewise no man possesses a character. Every man is a character. “Character is that which a man really is” Hence the expressions “Jacob’s character” and “Esau’s character” are not properly Scriptural terms. The patriarch Jacob was a good man and therefore a good character, whereas his twin brother, Esau, was a bad man and therefore a bad character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it a proper expression, therefore, to say that a Christian must develop a character pleasing to God before he can be received into God’s kingdom? Such is not a correct expression, because it implies that the Christian must develop something to a point where God will approve him, that he must do this by his own efforts, and that the thing developed is something separate and distinct from himself. No wonder, then, that many Christians have become discouraged. The improper view of the matter is discouraging, whereas the proper understanding of it gives courage to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">315</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christian. It should be our purpose always to encourage and help one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To illustrate: A printer’s type is made from metal. The letter A is a character. This letter may be cut out of a rough piece of steel. As soon as it is formed into the letter A it is a character, but it is rough and unsightly. The roughness is taken off and it is subjected to a high polish until it becomes very beautiful. The polishing process is not the developing of a character; it is the change of the identical character from one degree of unsightliness to a degree of beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time that a man consecrates himself to God by a covenant to do God’s will as Christ Jesus does that will, that man becomes a Christian. He is then a character. He is a Christian. He does not possess a Christian nor does he possess a character. He is now in the rough. Must this Christian, this character, undergo a change, or must he “develop a character to perfection” before God can receive him? This question must be answered by the Word of the Lord. Man’s theory is unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Peter, in both of his epistles, addresses Christians that have been begotten of the spirit of God as his spiritual children. To these the apostle says: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2: 21) Now the question is: Was Jesus required to develop a character before he could be received into the Kingdom, and did he develop such character while on the earth? The proper answer to this question furnishes the criterion by which the followers of Jesus must be guided, and the answer to the question must be emphatically </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No; </span><span class="font5">because Jesus was a perfect character when on the earth. He did not have a character to develop; he was a character, and he was perfect; otherwise he could not have been acceptable as the great ransom sacrifice to redeem believing and faithful humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But from the time he consecrated himself to Jehovah God and was baptized in water to symbolize that consecration and was thereafter begotten of God’s holy spirit, from that time until his resurrection from the dead did not Jesus have to develop a perfect character as a “new creature”? He did not. Had he developed such a character as a new creature while in the flesh, then Jesus would have had that likeness spoken of by the apostle before he died and was raised from the dead. He did not raise himself from the dead, but God raised him up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Hebrews 5: 8, 9 it is written: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” Does not this mean that he was made perfect in his character? The answer is, No. Jesus entered into a covenant with his Father to do his Father’s will. He was put to the most severe tests of his integrity toward Jehovah God, and under these tests he maintained his integrity and proved his unswerving loyalty, devotion and faithfulness to God. The purpose of the things which he suffered was to prove his faithfulness under the most adverse circumstances. He met all these tests and thereby completely learned obedience. “For it became him [Jehovah God], for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation [Christ Jesus] perfect through sufferings.”—Heb. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “perfect” used by the apostle Paul in the foregoing texts means to complete, to consummate, to accomplish. Note that the texts do not say that Jesus perfected his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">character</span><span class="font5"> by the things which he suffered. What is said is this: He learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and having completed or consummated his covenant with God he became the author of eternal salvation. “He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” (Phil. 2: 8) Otherwise stated, when Jesus finished his covenant of sacrifice God gave him the reward by making him the author of the eternal salvation of obedient humankind. At the same time God gave to him immortality and a glory like unto His own, and thereby Jesus became “an exact impress of [God’s] substance”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Jesus did his followers must likewise do, because they are called to follow in his footsteps. All such as will ultimately be made perfect, glorious characters and “be like him” must be so made by Jehovah God in the “first resurrection”.—1 John 3:2; Rev. 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true Christian has, like Jesus, entered into a covenant to do Jehovah’s will. The word “covenant” is the solemn form of expressing the word “contract”. Two are required to make a covenant, and the minds of both parties thereto must agree. “Christian” is the name applied to a man who makes a full consecration whereby he agrees to do God’s will, trusting in the merit of Christ Jesus as his Redeemer. In substance, his part of the contract may be stated thus: “I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and I promise and agree to do thy will, 0 God, whatsoever it may be.” If God takes a man into covenant with him, that is called a “bilateral” or two-sided covenant. The obligation rests upon both parties to the covenant to carry that covenant into complete operation according to its terms. Jehovah God binds himself to perform all his covenants. Almighty God makes it impossible for his side of the covenant to fail. Can a man who has been taken into a covenant with God treat his obligations under that covenant lightly and violate or break them without punishment ? Romans 1:31, 32 answers: “Covenant breakers . . . are worthy of death.” God is faithful in all things he has promised, and he requires faithfulness of all those who undertake to perform an agreement or covenant with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today the worldly powers endeavor to force God’s covenant people to repudiate their covenant and to break the terms thereof by conforming themselves to the things of this world, which things are contrary to Jehovah’s commandment and will. The facts show that God’s faithful covenant people remain steadfast to Jehovah, faithful to the terms of their covenant and to The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, regardless of all threats or acts leveled against them. The faithful covenant people of God will not fear man or what man can do. They do fear Almighty God and obey and serve him. As for wicked men, their power ends with death, but the power of Almighty God is eternal. If one in a covenant dies unfaithful to God, that is the end of him everlastingly. If he dies at the hands of wicked men because he is faithful to Jehovah and to the obligations of his covenant, Jehovah will resurrect that faithful one to life eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should a man hesitate to faithfully keep covenant with Jehovah in the face of all human opposition or punishment, either threatened or applied! The man who is in a covenant with Jehovah and has partaken of the knowledge of the good things to be given by the Lord God does not permit himself even to debate in mind as to whether or not he should obey man and thereby break his covenant. He who maintains his integrity toward God is determined to keep his covenant obligations faithfully to the end, regardless of what may be done against him by any human power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At 2 Peter 1: 5-8 the apostle says: “And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance [self-control] ; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The apostle Peter is not here telling Christians how to develop character, but is telling them how to perform their covenant, and then, for the encouragement of Christians, he adds (vs. 10) : “If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why read into the inspired words of the apostle that which is not there? Where in the Scriptures do we find warrant for the statement made by religionists: “Your part and my part in the eternal purpose of God depends upon our character development, and we must get busy and develop this character, a perfect character, while in this life”? Every Christian knows he cannot do anything perfectly, but he does know he can do his best to perform that which he has agreed with the Lord to do. The apostle Peter states what he must </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">do</span><span class="font5"> ; and to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font5"> means to work, and that work must be done with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christian may put forth his very best endeavors to do the things mentioned by Peter and yet he is always mindful of his many weaknesses and imperfections. He knows he is not perfect. With the wrong understanding of “character development” he would certainly become discouraged, but with a proper understanding of integrity and of his covenant with God he with joy can say: “My Father is the righteous God. He knows my heart and that I love him and am striving to be his true and faithful witness.” To such Christians the message of the apostle joyfully rings in their ears: TBe not discouraged; if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.’ This means that if you faithfully put forth your best efforts to perform your part of the covenant you are absolutely certain to win and to gain God’s approval and the blessings he has reserved for those who maintain their integrity toward him and thus prove the Devil’s false charge a lie.—Job 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.” (2 Pet. 1: 9) Some may speak gently, never express anger or displeasure, always appear to be very good, quie| and pious, read the Scriptures daily, think of holy things, and imagine they are “developing a wonderful character” ; yet they will fail of the kingdom if they have failed or refused to </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">do</span><span class="font5"> the things required by their covenant. The above words of the apostle are not instructions as to how to “develop a character”, but are plain statements of what must be done by all Christians in the faithful performance of the covenant they made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dreaming Christians are blind. They look to their own virtties and forget that their cleansing was by the blood of Jesus and that their standing before God is only by virtue of his righteousness. Let the dreamers talk of “developing a perfect character”. Let all Christians that would main-tain.-their integrity toward God be active in the performance of their covenant. Those who thus </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font5"> “shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ”, but will be appreciating the light of truth as God gives it to his covenant people and will be showing that appreciation by joyfully participating in his active service. There is a tremendous witness to be given in the earth before the final overthrow of Satan’s organization. Christians, gird up your loins, and go forth to that service joyfully, showing forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Let us do what we have agreed to do by the terms of our covenant, and leave the character to God. It is God who will make a glorious character of him that is faithful to the end In the Kingdom, and not until then, will the Christian become a perfect character. “Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on [serve] thee.”—Psalm 25: 21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark9"></a>LIGHTNING-WAR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">i 'HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> reigneth; let the earth rejoice; . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I his lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.” (Ps. 97:1-4) Jehovah is the source of the lightnings. He uses the things which he has made and which are visible to man, to teach man concerning that which is invisible to him. The things both visible and invisible which God has provided he will cause to work out for good to those who are unselfishly devoted and obedient to him. All lightnings proceed from Jehovah and are a manifestation of his power. This is proved by his words to Job: “Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Behold us?&quot;—Job 38:35, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.” (Jer. 10:13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Lightning illuminates and reveals that which was previously in the dark or obscured. Symbolically, God’s lightnings illuminate his Word for those who wait upon him, and reveal and expose that which is opposed to God and his organization. God’s lightnings apply at the time when God manifests his presence to his people, giving them greater light upon his Word and revealing his purposes toward them and also exposing their enemies. “Thunder” symbolizes the voice of Jehovah: “Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?” (Job 40:9) “The God of glory thundereth.” (Ps. 29:3) With thunder there comes rain in abundance. (Job 38:34) Rain is a symbol of refreshing truth that refreshes and makes glad the heart of the people of God.—Job 29:23; Pss. 68: 9; 147:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time his lightnings, thunders and rains Jehovah has brought forth from his treasury and has poured out his spirit upon all his anointed witnesses on earth to the end that these may tell the people of the day of his vengeance and of his purpose to destroy the enemy Satan’s organization, and to make for himself a name and vindicate it, and to establish his government of righteousness for the benefit of obedient humankind. There could be no other reason why Jehovah God would say to his covenant people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.” (Isa. 43.12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> God does nothing in the corner. He will have notice given and he uses his faithful servants to serve notice upon the people, that those may know of his purposes who might desire to know. The work of thus serving notice or giving the witness to the name of Jehovah is but the prelude to the great battle of Armageddon. Concerning this approaching storm it is written, at Job 36:32,33, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.:</span><span class="font5"> “He covereth his hands with the lightning, and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark. The noise thereof telleth concerning him, the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s lightnings are not aimless. There is a well-preconceived purpose in bringing forth at this time his lightnings of truth. His hand is a symbol of his power, and he covers his hands with the lightnings and strikes squarely home at religion. His people are cheered thereby, and the enemy organization trembles. His thundering voice tells concerning his purpose, and he serves notice upon the small and the great, even those represented by “the cattle”. The declaration of the day of his vengeance is one part of the commission he gives to his anointed witnesses; therefore these anointed ones, in order to be faithful, must perform that commission now before Armageddon.—Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Hebrews 11:32-34 it is written: “And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets; who through faith subdued kingdoms, . . . out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.” Here Barak is specifically named because of his faith With him was Deborah, the prophetess of God, who worked with Barak. In the prophetic drama of God’s vengeance against his demon-worshiping enemies Deborah played a part picturing God’s capital organization under its Head Christ Jesus, while Barak, the commander of the loyal forces of Israel, played the part picturing Christ Jesus the Lord. With a small army of 10,000 men, poorly equipped, Barak joined battle with an overwhelming enemy host, which host was equipped with 900 iron chariots under the leadership of Sisera. In that battle the angels of heaven fought with Barak against Captain Sisera, and Almighty God sent a great storm and flood, which swept away the disorganized and disrupted army of Sisera, and then Barak destroyed the entire lot as they fled. (See Judges chapters four and five.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deborah sent a messenger to the north of her place of abode, a distance of forty-five miles into the territory of the tribe of Naphtali and right close up to the Canaanite city of Hazor, the royal residence of Jabin, Sisera’s king. The messenger of Deborah was sent to Barak, calling him into active service against the oppressors of Israel. The name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Barak</span><span class="font5"> means </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lightning.</span><span class="font5"> Satan, the mimic god, appears to have adopted the same name for his dictatorial representative in Germany who now carries on a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blitzkrieg, </span><span class="font5">or “lightning-war”. The Devil usually seizes upon the things that Jehovah uses, and tries to mimic them, and he uses the same to reproach the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the drama here under consideration the word “lightning” seems to refer to a weapon of warfare used against the enemies of Jehovah. So far in these modern days the Devil (acting through his agency, the Vatican) and the Nazis speak of their vicious assaults upon others as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blitzkrieg,</span><span class="font5"> or “lightning-war”. That war of the Devil’s representatives will avail nothing in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scriptures which show the use and meaning of “lightning” as a weapon of warfare follow: Psalm 144: 5-7 says “Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down ; touch the mountains,-and they shall smoke. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children.” Psalm 18: 14: “Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them ” 2 Samuel 22 : 15 “And he sent out arrows, and scattered them, lightning, and discomfited them.” Deuteronomy 32:41, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver </span><span class="font5">(marginal reading) : “If I whet the lightning of my sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, and will recompense them that hate me.” Ezekiel 21:9,10,15,28, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.:</span><span class="font5"> “Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished, it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter ; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied; ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter. . . . Say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning.” Zechariah 9:14- “And the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning. and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Barak, whose name means “lightning”, plajed the pait picturing Christ Jesus in two relations: (1) As the captain of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses now upon the earth engaged in God’s “strange work” against religion; and (2) as the Field Marshal of Jehovah leading the invisible angelic hosts of God in the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” in the accomplishment of His “strange act” at Armageddon. Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak (“Lightning”), said, at Matthew 24:27: “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When that mighty warrior leads the host of Jehovah in the final battle all the enemy will be completely in darkness and only the Lord will cause the light to shine for his faithful servants, and “his arrow shall go forth as the lightning”, smiting the terrified enemy. (Zech. 9:14) At that time there will be no hide-out for the enemy of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and none of the enemy shall in any wise find a way of escaping the death-dealing arrows of the Lord; and then before the arrows smite them they will know that this is the battle of the Almighty, the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord God chose the scene of battle in Barak’s day, which is evidence of his fighting for his own people. Looking down from the heights of Mount Tabor at the mighty and fully equipped army of Sisera, Barak might hesitate to move into the valley and there engage the enemy in battle without first receiving some definite instruction from Jehovah. Uttering that instruction, Deborah said to Barak: “Up; for this is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone out before thee?” That was the signal for Barak to move into action. That meant that the invisible forces of Jehovah’s organization were now in action against the enemy, which enemy thought himself, with his host and iron chariots, to be invincible. Sisera had not reckoned on the superhuman power being used against him. That part of the prophetic drama pictures the “strange act” of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those forces that went ahead of Barak were led by Jehovah’s invisible executive officer. Likewise, at Armageddon, the forces of righteousness are led by the only begotten and beloved Son of God, even him who is “the Bright and Morning Star” and the great Executioner of God’s wrath against the enemy. Together with him is an army of other spirit “stars”, all moving in their appointed courses and fighting against the enemy. (See Judges 5:20.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the battle against Sisera Jehovah called into action superhuman forces and his invisible Field Marshal used them, and with these a great and terrific barrage was laid down before Barak and his 10,000 men, which shielded and protected Barak and his army from the enemy’s view and aided in the assault they were about to make upon the enemy. Such was the “act of God”. This act of God was manifested when a tremendous storm of wind, rain and </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lightning</span><span class="font5"> came, and flooded the country. The river Kishon, whose dry bed Sisera and his chariots were crossing, was raised entirely out of its banks, and the waters rushing down the mountainsides and over the valley swept everything before them. Sisera and his unnumbered infantry and his 900 chariots could not well fight against that terrific storm. As this storm raged in advance of Barak he moved his army down the mountain into action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“So Barak went down from mount Tabor,” to engage the enemy in battle. In this part of the prophetic drama Barak (“Lightning”) pictured Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s mighty Avenger, and the drama shows that he will employ lightning or other superhuman weapons against the enemy host when the battle of Armageddon is fought. Even now the Lord Jesus is using “lightnings” of truth, which lightnings he shoots out against the enemy. This confounds the enemy and blinds them as to what is their proper course. Without any doubt, the Lord is now maneuvering the enemy for their destruction and confounding them, and this confusion of the enemy will greatly increase until the end. At the same time now the Greater Barak uses those faithful men and women on earth whom the Most High designates as “Jehovah’s witnesses” to herald these truths of light, which also confuse, confound and greatly incense those who are the enemies of The Theocracy. Such is Jehovah’s “strange work”, which precedes his “strange act” at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to this point Barak’s men did no fighting and killing, because the Lord God had gone out before them, confounding the enemy and driving them before the great storm, upsetting their iron chariots and sweeping them away. At this particular point the movement of Barak with his army of 10,000 Israelites down Mount Tabor pictured the presentday movement of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, the spiritual Israelites together with their faithful earthly companions, advancing steadfastly and with unbroken ranks, pressing the battle to the gate against religion, or demonism. They go on regardless of the apparently overwhelming opposition against them. The visible enemies on earth have fortified themselves behind a “refuge of lies” (Isa 28: 15,17), religion or demonism being the enemy’s principal means of deceiving the people. It is against this refuge of Ues that Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions now press the battle by heralding the message of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government against the fortifications of the enemy. This “strange work” immediately precedes the victorious assault by the Greater Barak with his invisible heavenly hosts at Armageddon, and which assault shall result in the complete destruction of the enemy forces there, visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the physical facts now indicate the battle of Armageddon is quite near, when the real fighting takes place and the enemy will be destroyed. Soon Jehovah God through Christ Jesus will fight against the enemy as he did in times of old, and will completely cut to pieces the enemy, and deliver all those who remain faithful and true to The Theocracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JUVENILE WITNESSES, NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The two, one aged 10 and the other 12, are just outside the Byker Police Station, one having had a spill off his bicycle. The policeman on duty outside the station comes over: ‘Are you hurt!’ No, thank you [rubbing dust off his clothes and magazine bag].’ Police, seeing magazine bag: ‘What’s all this! The Theocratic Government!’ ‘That’s God’s kingdom.’ ‘Oh, I see; it has something to do with the Bible then.’ ‘Yes, that’s right, and we have some books here explaining the Bible.’ ‘Oh, I read the Bible.’ ‘Yes, but do you understand it!’ ‘Well, I understand it as well as the next man—Here, do you know the ten commandments!’ ‘Yes, I know them, but do you know the Beatitudes!’ ‘The Beatitudes ! I don’t seem to know those. Are you sure they are in the Bible!’ ‘Certainly they are—but I thought you said you knew the Bible!’ ‘Well, I don’t know about that—’ Second policeman, coming off duty from station: ‘Well, your bike seems O.K., pedals not bent, wheels are quite straight—’ First police: ‘Here, don’t bother about the bike; these two youngsters have me properly tied up and puzzled over the Bible.’ ‘Oh, have they! Well, if they’ve puzzled you, they might as well try and puzzle me. What’s it all about anyway!’ ‘We have a gramophone record here which will explain better than we can. Would you like to hear it! It only takes a few minutes.’ ‘Well, a few minutes can be a long time.’ ‘Yes, but this only takes four minutes.’ ‘Oh, well, we could spare that.’ Boys play ‘Awake’ recording through in the street. Second police: ‘That was a good speech. Why not bring it into the station and let the chief hear it!’ ‘Certainly !’ They enter station with second policeman, who, with broad grin, on entering says: ‘I place you two under arrest !’ The phonograph was placed on a table next to the sergeant’s, and ‘Awake’ was played through again. Six policemen were listening, including the desk sergeant. Whilst the record was running the constable who brought the young witnesses into the station rang up the A.R.P. Auxiliary Fire Service sub-station, in the police station, and held the telephone microphone near the phonograph so that the operator could hear. The constable was then seen to talk into the telephone and replace the receiver. After the record had finished, three booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font5"> were placed, including one to the desk sergeant. One of the constables asked the juvenile ambassadors if a policeman could be a Christian, and he was answered by both at once: ‘Anyone can be a Christian.’ While the record was running the police radio operator had removed one of his earphones, to hear better. The two young witnesses were then conducted downstairs (past the cells!) to the A.R.P. sub-station, where they found two girl telephonists sitting at the operating board, also three men and one girl A.R.P. personnel. The constable left them here, having shown them the side door leading outside. The phonograph was put on again and Judge Rutherford, in great form, exhorted all those hearing to ‘awake!’ While the record ran the telephone rang, but the operator ignored it. Finally in desperation she lifted the receiver and said. ‘I am listening to a most important lecture and I haven’t time to talk to you,’ and thereupon slammed the receiver down. On completion of the lecture the two young Theocratic ambassadors made their exit and continued on their way. Thus was concluded a first-rate witness to the polite and A.R.P. personnel at this station. It resulted in three booklets placed and twelve of sound attendance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN COSTA RICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On June 11, while I was witnessing in the village of Paraiso, in a public establishment, an inspector of sanitation invited me to drink liquor. I refused, and he asked to see the books. When he saw they were on the Bible he ordered me to accompany him to police headquarters. I paid no attention to him and he went out on the street to call the police. Then the young owner of the establishment came out in my defense and told the inspector I was working honestly and he immediately called witnesses, saying that that inspector was going to lose his job because he had tried to do something unlawful. Then the inspector was very fearful and did not bother me any more.—Psalm 34: 7.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEW MEETS CATHOLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My natural brother warned me not to mention my ‘religion’ to my employer (Jew). An opportunity came. I presented </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and other publications. He took a subscription, two books, and some booklets, and expressed pleasure at receiving the information they contained. During the St. Louis convention in August he was away on business, and when he came back he told me the following: ‘I was sitting in front of the resort hotel with seyeral pieces of literature on the bench, reading one of the publications. Suddenly a man standing before me said: ‘What have you there!” I replied, “Some very interesting and enlightening literature,” offering him a piece to examine. He said: “Are you one of those Jehovah brothers!” I said I did not know, but am pleased to read these publications. He then called me an ugly name and said I ought to be thrown out of the hotel. I said: “Who are you, and where do you get the liberty to talk to me that way!” He said: “I am Dr.----</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of the state medical society.” I replied: “Oh, so you are a doctor, working for humanity, and now you want to do me injury for exercising my right to seek knowledge and to worship God!” He said: “Well, I am a Catholic and I get mad when I see that literature.” “Well,’.’ I replied, “I do not criticize you for being a Catholic. I am of Jewish origin, but that is not to say I must believe the way my parents did as a matter of course. I am looking for the truth, and am ready to take it where I find it. This literature is beautiful.” He then became apologetic and suggested that we go some place where his folks would not see him. So we went into the woods, where we examined and discussed the contents of the booklets. He asked me to forgive, and when I left the next morning he went with me to the train and continued to apologize and seemed to be a changed man.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A MODEL STUDY ON WHEELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A witness who drives a school bus suggested we gather the interested in the bus. After those near by were gathered we drove to another home several miles away, where the entire family are interested, and invited them to take their places in the bus, where ample seats, lights, and heat aided in carrying on a delightful model study. There were seventeen in attendance.”</span></p>

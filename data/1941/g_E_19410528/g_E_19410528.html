<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Domination</span><span class="font9"> [JSy /TIion Groves] ♦ The newspapers have deluded many into thinking that .Hitler is henton destroying the Catholic Church. This is mere propaganda, as the facts easily demonstrate. The truth is that Hitler is the Catholic Hierarchy’s weapon to force Catholic domination on the world. Both Hitler’s goal and his methods were devised by Jesuit priests hundreds of years before the Fuehrer came on the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Papal backing behind the march of the Catholic dictators has been revealed by many journalists, among which are included Pierre van Paassen, Dutchman; George Seldes, American; Lawrence Fernsworth, American Catholic; G. E. R. Gedye, Englishman; Jose Ber-gamin, Spanish Catholic; John McGovern, Scottish Catholic and member of Parliament ; Lord . Strabolgi, English member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fate of publications on this hemisphere which carry any comments reflecting discredit on the Papacy is noteworthy. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font9"> written and published by cx-priests of the Roman Catholic Church, has been boycotted from the newsstands in the city of New York, where it is printed. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Protestant Digest,</span><span class="font9"> which has constantly pointed out the tie between the Hierarchy and Nazi-Fascism, has suffered the same fate. A visit to Brentano’s, which claims to dispense the greatest variety of publications in the world at its Fifth Avenue store, will bring you only shakes of the head and sly looks from the clerks, if you ask for either of these publications. Similarly the books of Judge Rutherford, which have reached the amazing total of 350,000,000, in 75 languages, are stocked in no book stores, because they have been proscribed by the Hierarchy. Though found at the New York Public Library, it is said that they are fast disappearing through theft. These facts alone show the Hierarchy’s hatred of a free press.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font13">Hitler’s Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font9">S IT of no importance to you that the scourge of Europe, the bloodiest butcher of ail times, is’ a Roman Catholic? Do you know that the Catholic Church admits that Hitler is a recognized Catholic? Are you familiar with the curious fact that a group of Polish Catholics has requested the pope to excommunicate Hitler and that he 'has ignored their plea? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do you know that Masonry has been destroyed in Nazi Europe, and that Masons have been persecuted like wild beasts at the command of Hitler and Mussolini? Is it news to you that not only are the dictators of Germany and Italy both Catholics, but- also Petain, Weygand, Quisling, King Leopold of Belgium, Salazar (the dictator of Portugal), Franco (knighted “Defender of the Faith” by the pope), and Joseph P. Kennedy, ex-ambassador and chief American critic of Great Britain? Have you ever read in an American newspaper that the sale of the Holy Bible was forbidden in Catholic Quebec, or that 110,000 copies of the Bible were shipped by an English Society and permitted to enter Spain, afterwards to be confiscated and ground up to make paper pulp, at the orders of “Defender-of-the-Faith” Franco? Do you think that a glimpse of what Catholic domination will bring to America is worth your consideration? If these facts or considerations do not matter to you, then read no further. (See Notanda, p. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hierarchy outrages have been perpetrated upon </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century, The New Republic,</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font9"> a liberal weekly published in New York city for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">more than half a century. Where other attacks failed, they have been smeared as “Reds”. For an. interesting study of the technique of “Red-baiting”, George Seldes’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Witch Hunt,</span><span class="font9"> published by Modern Age Books, New York city, is recommended. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Note:</span><span class="font9"> You need not try the local bookstore for this.) Seldes is . also author of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Crisis,</span><span class="font9"> in which he records no free editor in America of any consequence that has </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span><span class="font9"> had pressure or threat of boycott from the Papal agents in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Examples could be multiplied, but the above is considered enough to focus attention on the reason for this Catholic attack on freedom of publication, namely, _ that the Hierarchy organization, which is founded on a “refuge of lies”, cannot endure free expression. It thrives on darkness and deception and flees from the light. Once the people are enlightened about its murderous activities, it is impossible to drain substance and support from the protesting populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This explains the Franco “Rebellion” in Spain, The Catholic Church owned the land, the power companies, and citrus and other food supplies so pitifully needed by the starving peasantry. Enough freedom of speech had been permitted under the Republican administration to expose this feudal tyranny so thinly veiled under a religious name. Rome must act. The legions of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco finally crushed the cause of freedom, while Catholic bishops throughout the world ballyhooed about the 'valiant struggle’ of “Christian Franco” against the “hordes of Communism”. H. B. Southworth, writing for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Nation,</span><span class="font9"> described this hullabaloo as the “most dishonest of our age”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">America is going into a tailspin chiefly because the Hierarchy has thrown a monkey wrench into the free principles of our operation. Boycott and threat sometimes serve her purpose. Against Jehovah’s witnesses she has employed priest-led mobs, burned their possessions, driven them like cattle, mutilated their bodies by castration, and persecuted them with all the fury of the Holy Roman Inquisition. Few newspapers have covered the facts, and Americans have been led to believe generally that Jehovah’s witnesses are “troublemakers” who “hate everything”, as described in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post.</span><span class="font9"> As for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post's</span><span class="font9"> un-American conduct and policies, more will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this country we are permitted to see the first step in Catholic domination, which always carries with it the bludgeoning of free press and free dissemination of ideas. It is pointed out that such freedom is heinous to Rome, for the simple reason that free expression means her undoing. Her vicious assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses is incited by the desperation with which she views exposure. When her self-exaltation, and her claims to represent Almighty God, and to have sole power to dispense both salvation and punishment, receive a thorough going-over, in the light of Bible truths ; and the history of her antiChristian conduct is set beside her extravagant assertions of representing Christ; when all this is brought out for intelligent examination in plain English, it appears to her that “the jigius is upius pretty quickicus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This predicament of the Catholic Hierarchy was foretold centuries ago by Jehovah through His prophet Isaiah. “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death [such as sole rights on praying out of “purgatory”, claimed by the Catholic Church], and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have-made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, . Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall .overflow the hiding place.” (Isaiah 28:15-17) The Lord’s truth is likened unto a “fountain of living waters”. (Jeremiah 2:13; 17:13; compare Revelation 22:17) “Hail” refers to His. hailstorm of truths’. “And there fell upon inen a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men [particularly the Hierarchy] blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” (Revelation 16: 21) The comment made in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font9">(BookTwo), copyrighted in 1930, was as follows: “This is not literal hail, but cold, hard and destructive truths which fall from Jehovah’s heaven. . . , [Jehovah’s -witnesses] are the ones that hurl the hail, and this they can do only by faithfully keeping the commdYidments of the Lord and giving the testimony of Jesus Christ. Therefore the remnant must be his witnesses and publish God’s truth. There must be a widespread witness to the truth amongst the nations to make known God’s purposes, particularly with reference to the prophecies which smite Satan’s organization; and while doing this work the remnant will be the object of persecution and much opposition. The opponents will blaspheme God’s name because that hailstorm of truth ‘shall sweep away the refuge of lies’ that have Jong blinded the people. —Isaiah 28:17.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here is stated the Scriptural reason why the Hierarchy persecutes everything and everybody that stands in her way to world domination. In America it has been noted that she starts out with throttling the press and choking every organization that is offensive to her schemes. One might reasonably ask, What has this to do with Hitler? The</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">answer is that Nazi Germany, now including most of continental Europe, represents complete Catholic domination. Nazism is Catholic Action run rampant. It is the result of the unrestrained ambition of all popes to crush even the semblance of opposition. The Papacy does not love even “good Marshal Petain” or Brother Benito with the same devotion of heart' accorded to Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Papal-Berlin Axis</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our cowardly press has failed to note the heart-and-hope alliance between the pope and the Fuehrer. Aside from all the documentary evidence which will be presented, let the intelligent and honest man ask himself this question: Why should the pope favor England or America, two nominally Protestant countries which support the “heresy'’ of freedom? Does not everyone see that the Boman Catholic Hierarchy has a tremendous stake in Hitler’s conquests? Hitler’s first move has always been to destroy every opponent of the Church .of Rome in each butchered country. The corpse of the nation has always had a big injection of Catholic religion; Masonry has been exterminated, and Catholic orders reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The most important fact about Hitler is that he is backed up by the international power of Roman Catholicism. If this is true, and it is true, is not every priest an agent of Hitler, and every Roman Catholic who obeys the priest without question, a suspect of subversive activities? Let those who have set upon the Communists and Jehovah’s witnesses give that consideration, if they honestly seek t6 rid the country of spies. If they are only smearing red paint for Hitler, then they will surely rue such action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord foretold the appearance of the triple monstrosity of Communism-Fascism-Nazism. (Daniel 12:11; Mark 13:14) They were reared up by the Catholic Hierarchy, at the instance of the Devil, to mock and oppose God’s kingdom, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span><span class="font9"> “It is Satan, that wicked one, operating his religious-total</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941 </span><span class="font9">itarian conspiracy against </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy,</span><span class="font9"> that is now desperately fighting against Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no compromise and no possibility of peace between God and the wicked. Today the Vatican officials, together with Fascist, Nazi and Communist dictators, are moving with all their power to destroy everything in the earth that will not submit to their devilish rule.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine, issue of January 15, 1941, paragraph 1) Thus is clearly stated the great issue today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler is a Catholic. He has a concordat or working agreement with the Vatican. The pope himself was one of the first to acclaim Hitler’s puppet, Petain; and a Belgium cardinal was loud in praise of Leopold’s treachery that shocked the world which remembered the brave stand of Leopold’s father, Albert; the United States ambassador to Belgium astonished the uninformed with the news that the advancing German troops protected all the Catholic churches ; a remarkable feature of the Nazi advance was the behjnd-the-lines strategy of parachute troops landed in priest and nun costumes; yet the United States press continues to peddle the deception that the pope is a great benefactor. The press systems of America form the greatest propaganda agency for Rome that exists in the world today. When they do not lie, they suppress stories of public interest. If it is difficult to prevent some leakage of incriminating evidence about the Hierarchy they manhandle the dispatch or hide it among the obituaries. They have done a brilliant piece of batting for the foreign foes of this nation, and every outcry has been drowned under belittling epithets or outright libelous abuse. There is a partial picture of the majority of newspapers. Listen to them if you want to be fooled!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Turn back the pages of memory to the year 1933. Communism and Fascism were already disturbing the world with their raucous voices. Pope Pius XII, present pope, was then secretary of state</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">to the Vatican, and was active with von Papen in the affairs of Germany. That ' was the year also of the Reichstag fire and Hitler’s appointment as chancellor. Then came the concordat that started the Buehrer to Catholic victory on the bloody corpse of Europe; July 6, 1933:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pact with Pope to Be Signed Today</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Herr Hitler, the German Chancellor, is not going to abandon his Catholic faith. Reports that he will join the Evangelical Church of Germany were denied in Berlin yesterday, says Reuter . . . Although a concordat between the Pope and Hitler is virtually concluded-—it is likely to be initiated today-— the offices of all Catholic societies and clubs in Prussia were shut down during the weekend. Even the offices of the Y.M.C.A. were raided and documents and funds seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Centre Party’s Exit</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The disappearance of the last political party outside the Nazis is considered to be only a question of hours, following the announcement that the Centre (Catholic) Party has dismissed all its employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whether the Centre deputies will retain their seats or not it is certain, says the British United Press, that political Catholicism is doomed. [Thus Paeelli fooled the world by changing the name of “political Catholicism&quot; to “National Socialism&quot; or “Nazi&quot;. This trick probably earned for him the Papal crown in 1939.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Christian Social People’s Party “faded out’’ yesterday, its four members in the Reichstag joining the Nazi ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A prophecy that the National Socialist State would flourish for centuries, and a threat to crush with all brutality and entire lack of consideration any attempt to overthrow the Government, । were uttered by Hitler in a speech at Bad Reiehenhall, Bavaria, adds the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Internal unity, that is to say, the disappearance of every party save the Nazi Party, is on the eve of attainment,&quot; he declared. “From this inner consolidation will evolve external power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus Hitler thundered as reported in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font9"> (England) July 6,1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler’s ‘destruction’ of the Catholic Centre Party did not disturb the pope any more than the change of name in marriage disturbs a bride. In fact, he was gratified. It afforded an opportunity to delude the world into believing that his ruthless ally was, in fact, persecuting the Catholic Church in Germany, and so the murderous Hierarchy would appear in the guise of a martyr, receiving the world’s sympathy just as the real victims of Nazi terror. American presses could be counted on, with a little pressure here and there, to play up this martyr-role. Hitler would be rewarded with some special favor or indulgence, perhaps even a by-pass to bliss without the usual sojourn in “purgatory”. He thanked the god of this world, Satan, (2 Corinthians 4:4) for the ingenuity of his secretary of state, Eugenio Paeelli. The Papal march to world domination could now proceed under the new banner of Nazism without detection by the liberal, democratic nations. Now the world may observe the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nazism was referred to by a German in South America as the ‘Catholic Revolutionary Movement’. (New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times') </span><span class="font9">Just as Coughlin's National Party means “Nazi” Party, so the Nazi swastika is the smokescreen behind which the minions of Rome advance. Fascism is merely a synonymous term, and both are linked with Communism. The combined purpose is to rule the world in defiance of </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy,</span><span class="font9"> otherwise known as the Kingdom of Heaven, which Jehovah has decreed shall destroy this “abomination that raaketh desolate”. (Daniel 11:31) “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron.” (Psalm 2:9) “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left, to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.’’ (Daniel 2:44) “And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.”—Revelation 11:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler is in the lead of the totalitarian monstrosity that seeks to ‘•'consume” all other nations, in defiance of Jehovah. This totalitarian combine sets itself up in the place of </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy,</span><span class="font9"> and is therefore the “abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not”, or “in the holy place” assigned to God’s kingdom. (Compare Matthew 24:15 with Mark 13:14. See also “Lovers of Righteousness”, Part 2, in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine of September 15, 1938, which gives a brief history of the rise of C omnium sm-Fascism-Nazism and then states, page 277: “The monstrosity, the giant Goliath, therefore pictured a ‘totalitarian state’, which places the state above Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and which commands all people to be subject to the ‘state’, in defiance of Jehovah God.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is the year 1941. The people have no time to look back. The present is filled with terrors sufficient to blind all thought. It is upon this terror that the Hierarchy relies. People blinded by fear can be driven much more easily. Jesus foretold this day: “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” —Luke 21: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are indeed terrible days, fraught with peril, “for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath.” (Revelation 12:12) It is therefore the more imperative that the people put aside hysteria and give sober thought to the situation. Fear of creatures is worse than hopeless. It makes those who yield to it the easy victims and dupes of propaganda and they join the headlong rush to destruction. (Proverbs 29:25) Only<sup>7 </sup>the Lord is properly<sup>7</sup> to be feared, for He alone can save and destroy, grant life and cause to perish in death, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9; 10) “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1841</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">y<sup>7</sup>our fear, and let him be your dread.” Not even death is to be feared, because if one dies in the righteous performance of duty, a “martyr” or witness to the name of Jehovah, the Lord will resurrect such as may fall at the enemy’s hands. Jesus stated this admonition: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul [right to existence]: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”—Matthew 10: 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seek the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, should the reasonable creature do? ITow often the Scriptural answer is repeated: “Seek the Lord”! (1 Chronicles 16:11;22:19; Ezra 6 : 21) The-prophet Isaiah shows that there is a time limit set for such seeking: “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call y<sup>7</sup>e upon him while he is near.” (Isaiah 55: 6) It is necessary to act at once, because Armageddon is near. “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may he ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” (Zephaniah 2 : 3) Such teachable people are admonished to do this “before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon y<sup>7</sup>ou, before the day<sup>7</sup> of the Lord’s anger come upon you”.—Verse 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Included within the meaning of ‘seeking the Lord’ is the study of His Word, the Bible. (2 Timothy 2:15; Psalm 119 :105 ; John 17 :17) In the first chapter of Isaiah (verse 18) the Lord calls this to the attention of the people : “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.” The Lord is now giving an understanding of the prophecies for the comfort of those who seek Him and study His Word. Among these prophecies now to be understood, several prophetic dramas depicted the close alliance between the religious and commercial with the political element, particularly the totalitarian monstrosity<sup>7</sup> now overrun-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ning the earth. It is therefore important to consider how the facts today show the fulfillment of these prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler’s religion and his alliance with the Papacy consequently have significance, because the pope and the Nazi dictator are the foremost representatives in religion and politics. The relationship between the two is pointed out, not to ridicule the Catholic people or the German nation, but in order to give further evidence of the fulfillment of the prophecy that religion and politics, together with commerce, would join hands to oppress the people and fight against Tun </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy</span><span class="font9"> in these latter days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The emphatic statement is here made that Hitler is engaged in a work of 'converting’ Europe to Catholicism such as existed before the Reformation in which Luther, Zwingli, Huss and the English “martyrs” led a break-away from the Church of Rome. The fires of the Roman Catholic Inquisition, instituted to consume these “heretics”, failed to stop the rise of Protestantism. The pope also organized a counter-Reformation intended to offset the loss of influence and power due to the Protestant cleavage. Four hundred years ago the “Society of Jesus” was founded by Ignatius Loyola. The members of this order became known as “Jesuits”. Their announced purpose has always been to destroy Protestantism. Masonry, democracy and liberalism, called the. “children of Protestantism”, are also slated for oblivion. This is the Jesuit aim, has never changed in 400 years, and has only been amplified to meet modern developments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Back in the sixteenth century some terrible things were perpetrated upon the people of Europe by Catholic authorities in their anger against the loss of power through Protestantism. Catherine de Medici, niece of the pope, caused the massacre of the French Protestants whom she had invited to her daughter’s wedding, while Catholic church bells in Italy celebrated this mass murder; the bloody duke of Alva butchered and burned in the pope’s name; “Bloody Mary” fostered the Catholic Inquisition, in which several hundred righteous Englishmen, such as Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Rogers, were burned at the stake, and thousands more punished; and in 1588 the destruction of the Spanish Armada, sent against England by the pope, vras a great backset to the Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Jesuits did not get very far for several centuries, but their efforts were by no means abandoned. Under President McKinley the United States, Protestant and consequently hated, was both attacked by Catholic Spain and menaced by Catholic Germany, whose fleet Admiral Dewey eluded in Manila. Again in 1912 the pope urged the kaiser of World War 1 fame to become the “sw’ord of the church”. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all of these instances the Papal aggressors received setbacks. But today, the Scriptures disclose, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will have a brief moment of complete success in which she will cry ‘All is well, all is safe’. Since it is the Lord’s purpose to permit this short term of power, it is certainly not the purpose of this publication to prevent rise to world domination, nor could it be prevented. But attention is called to the evidence of its advancement, and its methods of advancement, that the people who so desire may “come out of her [the death-dealing Hierarchy organization]” that they may avoid the punishment and “plagues” presently to be visited upon antitypical Babylon by the hand of Jehovah’s Executioner.—Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Returning now to the fulfillment of prophecy concerning the conspiracy between religion, commerce and politics, particularly with the totalitarian monstrosity. Some still believe that Hitler has fought the Roman Catholic Church. Nothing could be farther from the facts. The dissolution of the German Catholic Centre Party had long been desired by the pope because such was in reality a liberal party, and consequently as much hated by the ruling Jesuit element of the Church of Rome as is Protestantism. Competent journalists such as the abovementioned clearly pointed out these facts. The same was the cause of the demise of the Catholic Dolfuss in Austria.. It was to the liberal element that Mussolini referred in his tirade against the democracies and “a certain vacillating Catholicism” with which he “would know how to deal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consider the facts revealed in the year 1936, year of Italian triumphs in Ethiopia and the Catholic onslaught upon men of their own faith in Spain. The pope was not “mad” with Hitler about anything in that year. Some interesting disclosures are made by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Leader </span><span class="font9">(English newspaper) in its issue of April 14, 1936, in an article about the pope entitled “Man Who Rules Over 350,000,000 People 1” This was a complimentary sketch containing such statements as, “His income [the pope’s] is over £30,000,000 a year, and yet he has no direct interest in the spending of-hardly a penny.” Under the subhead “Hitler as G uest” comes the paragraph: “Tradition orders him to eat in solitude. He does not obey. Usually a secretary or a cardinal is the guest. Sometimes bigger fry. Hitler lunched with the Pope not long ago.” No indication of Papal disapproval at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this four-column glorification of the pope and Vatican there is but one doubtful note that Englishmen especially would do well to reflect upon today:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is this man of whom now the world wonders: Could he stop the Abyssinian war? . . . Could the Pope excommunicate Mussolini as a courageous Pope once excommunicated King John ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even Archbishop Hinsley of Westminster, head of the Catholic Church of England, cannot give an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Until he is invited to intervene by both sides he cannot act as judge,” the Archbishop has explained. “Our Holy Father’s choice is between evils. Either he must condone what the world regards as a monstrous injustice, or he can denounce his neighbour as a law</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 23, 1941 </span><span class="font7">breaker. If Fascism g°<sup>es</sup> under nothing can save Italy from chaos. God’s cause goes under with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“God’s cause goes under with [Fascism].” Those were the words of the head of the Catholic Church of England, spoken in April 1936. Since Italy has now joined Germany in the murderous attack upon England, and the present pope has blessed the arms of Italy, the real enemies of the British Empire readily appear. Other issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> disclosed how German bishops, with the sanction of the pope, similarly praised the arms of Hitler, and quoted newspaper accounts of the treachery of priests in various parts of the Empire. Another case of this kind is published in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span><span class="font9"> (England), February 11, 1941:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">. Priest’s Secret Code: Fined</span><span class="font7"> £20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A code by which, it was stated, information could be sent out of the country was found in the possession of a young Roman Catholic priest on his arrival by air at a Barton (Lancashire) aerodrome from Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was Father George Colum McCabe, aged twenty-six, of St. Ambrose’s Rectory, Bir-mingham-road, Kidderminster. He was fined £20 at Eccles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Airport officials said that the document, giving a code and its key, was found in Father McCabe’s wallet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is no wonder that Catholics have been excluded from the Churchill government, and the British Purchasing Commission in New York specifies in hiring typists that they must be of English* Scotch, Welsh or Ulster Irish (Ulster is a Protestant county of Ireland and head of the several northern counties fighting with Britain against Hitler’s army of Catholic Action; Southern Ireland, of which Dublin is the capital, remains Catholic and anti-British, the harboring place for spies such as McCabe). (Authority for information about the British Purchasing Commission is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact, </span><span class="font9">issue of March 17, 1941.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler’s cementing together of a Cath-olic-Latin bloc of Central and Southern</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Europe has been pointed out by Wythe Williams, ‘'well-known radio commentator and journalist,” recently the coauthor with Dr. Albert Parry of a publication entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Riddle of the Reich. </span><span class="font9">(The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> Book Review, March 23,1941) Hitler describes himself as “Katholisch&quot; in the German </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Who’s Who</span><span class="font9"> called &quot;Wer 1st”, eqntaining an autobiography of the Fuehrer which precedes all other names in the volume. “Katholisch” means Roman Catholic. The following words of Hitler’s are so definitely the speech of the bigot that their Catholicism is unmistakable:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We shall recreate the splendid tradition of the Crusades, we shall carry out our mission to bring civilization to the east of Europe. A great field of activity will be opened up, and there will be a lot to do for the German Catholic clergy among the people who have run wild and who have been robbed by Jews and Bolshevists, not only of their land but of their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Paris the German controlled wireless has lately broadcast declarations that Hitler has never been against the churches. In Germany also since the war began Hitler has eased the restrictions upon some churches and in particular has sought a new working agreement with the Catholic elergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are well-authenticated accounts, for instance of a mission to the United States undertaken for Hitler by Father Odo, otherwise Duke Carl of Wurttemberg, with the purpose of persuading American Catholics that Hitler is fighting to give them fresh fields for conversion to Christian belief, says the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the above quotations are from a dispatch of Times-Southern Special Service, carried by the Vancouver </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font9"> (British Columbia, Canada) Tuesday, January 7, 1941. Americans should be and some are interested in the mission of “Father” Odo. The facts were published in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> of November 4,1940.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">News Service released the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome,</span><span class="font7"> Jan. 3. (By International News Service) Marking perhaps the first time that the Vatican has obtained any important concessions from Russia, Josef Stalin especially relaxed Soviet anti-religious laws to permit Catholics in Russian-occupied territories to attend Christmas services,—learned today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was learned that Chancellor Hitler aeted as intermediary between Pope Pius and the Soviet dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pope Pius, it was learned, was intensely gratified at the action of Germany and Russia —especially his success with Stalin. The Pontiff sent his personal thanks to Hitler through Mgr. Orscnigo. [Requoted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font7"> February, 1941]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer,</span><span class="font9"> newspaper which has been barred from Germany, had the following headline three days later, January 6, 1941:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pope Thanking Hitler for Aid, Stirs Capital</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BAN ON CATHOLICS EASED BY STALIN AT HITLER REQUEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Washington, Jan. 5. — Excitement is running high in the capital today over a turn in the events in Europe considered of leading significance—the liaison furnished, according to news stories, by Hitler, which resulted in Josef Stalin acceding to the wishes of Pope Pius XII and permitting the holding of Catholic holyday services in the Russian-occupied countries of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania during Christmas week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to apparently well-authenticated news stories of the past few days, the Pontiff was not only “intensely gratified at the action of Germany and Russia—especially his success with Stalin,” but, according to the same stories, he “sent his personal thanks to Hitler through Mgr. Orscnigo.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is conceded by many persons high in diplomatic circles here that the fact that the pope “sent his thanks” to Hitler is of tremendous import.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perhaps even Washington officials are beginning to see the close co-operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">between Hitler and the pope, and also that Communism Jias always been in the little family group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who have been shocked by the ruthless ferocity expressed in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font9"> will be interested to learn, according to Otto Strasser, “co-plotter and intimate friend of Hitler,” that the book was really written by“'Fathcr”Staemptle, “a priest of great learning and editor of a paper at Miesbach.” According to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font9"> February issue, Strasser says in his book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Hitler and 1 </span><span class="font9">that Hitler, “fearing the knowledge Father Staempfle had of his weaknesses, had him assassinated by a ’special death squad’ on the night of June 30, 1934.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pope’s plans for the “new order” in Europe are accurately described in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,</span><span class="font9"> February issue, under the subhead “Latin Catholic-Fascist Bloc”, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newly Catholicized, Fascist France js to play an important role in Hitler’s plans for his new Europe. According to the Overseas News Agency, all the Latin Catholic nations —France, Italy, Spain and Portugal—are to be formed into a Catholic-Latin religious bloc, providing that military, political and economic control remains in the hands of Berlin. Marshal Petain, who is even more in favor at the Vatican than Mussolini, will head this bloe of Catholic-Fascist nations, under certain conditions: France’s navy to be turned over to Germany, French Morocco to Spain. Mussolini, weakened by recent defeats of his armies, is being induced to revoke his claims on Nice, Corsica and Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This shapes up to the whole preconceived aim underlying Nazi-Fascist efforts, the restoration of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. All that would remain (after the collapse of Protestant England) would be the crowning of Hitler by the Pope as a modern Charlemagne. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Europe has thus been Catholicized and returned to a condition far worse than the “dark ages” which prevailed before the Reformation gave that continent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941 </span><span class="font9">some measure of freedom. England re-‘ mains the chief “heretical” country, w’hose Queen Elizabeth was ex-communicated a little less than four hundred years ago. England is the thorn in the Papal side and, of course, is to be exterminated along with Protestant America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just how tender will be the mercies of Catholic Action, if once England and America lie prostrate, is well illustrated by what befell Germany itself after the death of the Republic, and the conditions there today. On page 2 of the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mirror</span><span class="font9"> Magazine Section of February 9, 1941, appears a “General Map of the Concentration Camps, Prisons and Jails in Germany”, the locations being marked in red. These red markers are so numerous they blur together so that the whole half-page map appears like a blotch of blood. Beneath is a reproduction of a photograph of a weeping, aged woman, and the explanation follows: “Hardly a family in Germany has escaped suffering some form of punishment by the police.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bibelforschers (Jehovah’s witnesses)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Says the article:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At present, many political prisoners are from the ranks of the Bibelforschers (literally Bible Searchers, actually Jehovah’s witnesses). There are few Communists, but very many plain citizens who could not embrace the new ideals and so became punishable. For the most part they are convicted of specious criminal offenses with, however, a criminal background •—perjury, offenses against the national economy, sins against rules for giving work, insults. etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After release, any prisoner may, if the authorities so desire, be sent to a concentration camp for an indefinite period of “preventive custody”. Every </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibelfokscheb must</span><span class="font7"> be so transferred, women as well as men. No </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibel-forscher</span><span class="font7"> may </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ever</span><span class="font7"> attain freedom. Communists, eye ept party officials, may possibly be released after some years of proved “conversion” ; BiBEr.FORsciiERS, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In line with this description of the treatment of Jehovah’s servants is the</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reich Ba</span><span class="font9"> cikisr </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sentenced to Die</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Berlin, March 21 (UP)—Ludwig Cyranek, 33 years old, a member o£ the “International Society of Earnest Bible Scholars”, which opposes any form of military service, including air-raid defense, has been sentenced to death by a special court at Dresden, D.N.B., the official news agency, reported today. Five others, including two women, were sentenced to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> did not explain that “International Society of Earnest Bible Scholars” Is one of the names given Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> prefers to howl with the mobs, and call Jehovah’s witnesses ‘‘Fifth Columnists”, as they did last summer. The end of their howling time is even now fixed by the Lord God of Hosts,— Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Happens in a Concentration Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such glimpses, as reported by Konrad Heiden in his book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The New Inquisition, </span><span class="font9">of life inside the concentration camps are given to us now and then:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arrived in Buchenwald, we were ordered to descend (from the truck), “Hats Off,” came another command, and now we had to run between two rows of S.S. men. Some of them struck out with their fists and feet; others used brass knuckles and whips. A bulky sergeant wielded a short-handled whip resembling a Czarist knout, and doubtless intertwined with wore or studded with lead pellets. He laid it on our heads and every lash brought,-a spurt of blood. . , . There were no facilities for washing. . . . There was one latrine about thirty feet long for the entire barracks with their 10,000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is also among Rome’s modern Inquisition methods the rack, the thumbscrew, the squeezing of head, testes, and torture with molten iron, until death itself becomes a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rome’s Conqueror</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler, who has a commission from the pope to conquer in the name of the Catholic Church, is not lacking in assistants in America. The same’priests and Catholic Legionnaires who have assaulted and tortured Jehovah’s witnesses in many parts of the United States will form an effective nucleus for the American S.S. In the Catholic clerics, already trained in fiendish cruelty, is found a Gestapo, now organized and bloodthirsty to destroy any opponent of the pope. Recent information shows that their ferocity is unabated against Jehovah’s witnesses, who daily report destruction of their property and assaults on their persons. Let this be borne in mind: Jehovah’s witnesses will not be the only victims of Catholic Action unrestrained. Look upon Germany, and devout-Catholic Hitler, and be warned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s purpose is to permit wickedness to go to its full and be cut off by His Executioner when at its height. (Psalm 92: 7; Judges 3: 29, with explanation in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine, October 15, 1940, issue.) Religion, chief among which is Hitler’s Catholic religion, is doomed. Does anyone conceivably think we need more pf Hitler’s religion ? Our blood brothers at Valley Forge had not a Papist among them. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, sixty among Washington’s generals, John Hancock and a great many of his cosigners of the Declaration of Independence, w’ere Freemasons. So were the Marquis de Lafayette, Diderot, D’Alembert, Condorcet, the famous Swiss philosopher Helvetius, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire, wdio vitalized the French Revolution, which struck so heavily at Catholicism. Our authority for this enumeration is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The American Mercury,</span><span class="font9"> in its article on “The Annihilation of Freemasonry”, w<sup>?</sup>hich outlines the destruction of this anti-Catholic institution in Europe and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Nasis acted more swiftly. Immediately on Hitler’s rise to power the ten Grand Lodges (Masonic) of Germany wtjre dissolved. Many among the prominent dignitaries and members </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of the order were sent to concentration camps. The Gestapo seized the membership lists of the Grand Lodges and looted their libraries and collections of Masonic objects. Much of the loot was exhibited in an “Anti-Masonic Exposition” inaugurated in 1937 by Herr Dr. Joseph Goebbels in Munich. The exposition included completely furnished Masonic temples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The persecution was carried over into Austria when the country was captured by the Nazis. The Masters of the various Vienna lodges were immediately confined in the most notorious concentration camps, including the horrible living hell in Bavaria. The same procedure was repeated when Hitler took over Czechoslovakia, and then Poland. Immediately after conquering Holland and Belgium, the Nazis ordered the dissolution of the lodges in those nations. It was also Point One on the agenda of Major Quisling in Norway. It may be taken as part of the same ugly picture that General Franco of Spain in 1940 sentenced all Freemasons in his realm automatically to ten years in prison. When France fell last June, the Vichy government caused the two Masonic bodies of France, the Grand Orient and the Grande Loge, to be dissolved, their property being seized and sold at auction. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[The American Mercury,</span><span class="font7"> February, 1941]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus an age-old dream of all the popes is being realized through Catholic Hitler. The Catholic Church is sweeping all freedom from the face of the earth, and the attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses who expose her crimes is merely one part of an international program. What is no part of her plans is Jehovah’s decree that in the height of her power she shall be cut off by His Field Marshal, Christ Jesus. Her allies will turn against her, and in the end she will try to escape alone, as did Sisera, defeated general of the Canaanites. But the doom of religion is sealed, and those who look to it for support shall likewise perish. Thus the choice of life or death lies before all men. One must choose </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy,</span><span class="font9"> which affords protection and salvation, or religion’s read to death, exemplified by Hitler.—Elton Groves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J, Hemery (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The War’s Burden</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• The daily expenditure of the nation is about thirteen million pounds, or, stated in dollars at current rate of exchange, about sixty-five million dollars. It is a tremendous burden, but is borne without murmuring. Some of this expenditure is, of course, received back in wages and profits, and many businesses are doing well out of the war, and the rate of wages paid is much higher than in ordinary times. The Exchequer in turn gets back a very considerable amount of the extra by taxation of profits and by income tax deduction. There are limitations ip ability to purchase, because of shortness in supply, and there are the limitations in food, both by dangers in importing and by rationing; but there is no complaining, because the nation is ready and willing to sacrifice to see Nazism and Fascism rooted out of Europe, and to make as certain as possible that any attempted invasion of Britain shall have no chance of getting a hold on this land.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“New Order”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• Since Hitler and his gang of aggressors began to use this word as a cover for their actions in Europe the word has become common among those who look beyond the war, and whose hope is for a better adjustment of conditions of life for the masses of the people. Its use by Hitler is more recent than his cry for more living room for the German people. His grand ideas of dominion grew with the increase of his early successes, and he began to see himself as a world ruler with some chance of putting his demonized ambitions into a grand fulfillment,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">with himself as the dominant figure in the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">His original profession of being Germany's deliverer from its domestic troubles expanded to living room for the great people they were to be; now this great people are on the warpath to establish a “new order&quot; in Europe, and, when that is accomplished, to spread the rule over the seas and establish that &quot;order” throughout the whole earth. How much Hitler’s grandiose ideas have permeated the German peoples within his kingdom no outsider can know; but, human nature being what it is, there can be little doubt that he has persuaded the majority that he is a man of destiny to raise them to his own claims for them. It is certain that the youth and the younger of the last generation are obsessed with Hitler.’s notions and claims for himself. Those amongst the peoples through the earth who have heeded the call of Jehovah to His Word know that the time is come when the Devil and his evil hosts are abroad in the earth, and that men everywhere are being subjected to evil suggestions, and to<sub>#</sub>otherwise commendable ideas for a readjustment of social conditions which are absolutely opposed to violence in their establishment, but which are intended to lead the people away from thoughts of the purpose of God in His Theocratic kingdom, and to cause them to believe that of themselves they can bring order out of the chaos into which the earth is thrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whatever may be thought of the possibilities of Hitler’s success there can be no question of the fact that his schemes and the successes he can already, count have forced the nations into a realization that new forms of national life and international relationships have become an imperative matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Men of Good Intent</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• Separate from religionists there are very many men educated and fully alive to the need of much alteration in the regulation of the management of the nation’s affairs if there is to be a better sharing out of the fruits of labor. There are inequalities in educational facilities: money can give to the children of the well-to-do that which is as yet impossible to the great majority. The publicschool education, however good it is, or however clever the scholar, does not-give access to the professions as readily as that of the acknowledged schools practically separated to the education of the children of the rich. This distinction is almost rigidly maintained as one of the means of keeping up a class distinction in the land. An applicant for some position is asked, “At what school were you?” and if he can name one of the acknowledged schools his chance is a much better one than if he had to say, “At so-and-so council or board school.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Then there are men who see the imperative need for a readjustment of the agricultural industry, not only for the nation’s safety in wartime, but in order to have waste land brought into cultivation, and, too, for the improvement of the land laborer’s lot. There are many who seek to get the health conditions of the people improved, and their social conditions vastly altered for betterment. The Labor Party ’which has thrown its power into the war effort intends to see to it that the nation shall not be run for the special advantage of capital, nor in the money interest, and that the facilities of the nation shall be open to the people instead of at the disposal or to the particular advantage of the wealthy. The changes will bring an abundance of domestic scrapping when the time comes for the attempts at all this change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the meantime there is the war, and no man can foresee the course of events, however expectant or hopeful he may be. Hitler and his gang are wading through seas of blood for the realization of their plans and ambitions, and both Britain and the smaller nations of Southeast Europe have much to bear and to suffer before this dread thing is over. The Brit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ish people, now feeling the material as well as sympathetic aid of the American people, are set in their purpose, and are confident of the outcome, and are looking forward to the better things to be in consequence of being forced into a terrible war, and the consequent sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That all this is related to the judgments of God and His purpose of setting up the long-foretold Kingdom on earth is something which religionists refuse to believe, and which politicians, and the intelligent of the people, wdll not take into account. The religionists must be held to be mainly responsible for the refusal of the people to listen, and for the darkness which covers the people concerning the purposes of God. They have perverted the plain words of the Bible, and have led the people to believe they, the religionists, were the only ones who could say what the Scriptures reveal, and that they only have the right to so teach. They have made a great set of organizations for themselves; in fact, they have made a kingdom of their priesthood, and have proclaimed the most terrible of sanctions for unbelief of what they teach, threatening the pains of eternal torment if their dogmas are rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Religionists Disturbed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• The Papacy has already made its proclamation through the recently published five points of the pope’s declaration, and the British religionists have told the world they accept his points, but added five others, mainly to make themselves heard. Undoubtedly all of them are feeling the blowing of the winds of trouble. The Papacy, looking back through the centuries, and knowing the hold it has in the earth, confidently expects to be foremost in any readjustment in the affairs of the nations, having weathered the storm. The British religionists, confident in the strength of Britain, not only to withstand the threatened invasion of Britain and the attacks on the ‘Empire’, but also to carry the war through to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">destruction of Nazi aggression, and believing they are helping in a battle for righteousness in the earth, also expect to share in the “new order” outlined by the pope. But they have not the consciousness of strength Rome has: they are divided among themselves, although on occasion they will sing, “All one body we”; and they are very conscious of the fact that the profession of religion in Britain, and the standing of the priests and the parsons, are ever getting less in numbers and esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• Like most other Roman Catholic activities, this takes various forms. The war situation is providing opportunities among the various forces for great Boman Catholic activity. A “Militant Christian” (as he signs himself) writes to his paper suggesting the formation of an “Anti-blasphemy League”, “which ought to include both Catholics and all who believe they are fighting for Christian civilization.'<sup>7</sup> Cardinal Hinsley, who is doing some broadcasting, takes care to put over something that is calculated to associate non-Cafholics wfith their organization. He has already got more than 300,000 crosses which he has blessed distributed in certain forces, and wants to get the navy accepting them. This is not propaganda! But what of this as blasphemy&quot;? A “Legion of Mary” is being brought into notice. It is said that Mary is a priest, and the mediatrix of all graces; that God would not have willed to send a Savior except through her; that all God’s gifts and virtues and graces are administered by her. This i^ said in the name of religion, but it is grievous blasphemy against the name of the Father, and Jesus Christ: of the Father, who in His love for the world gave His only begotten Son; and of the Son, who so willingly conformed to the Father’s will as to give himself unto death as “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Moderation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font9">UR day was prophetically described in these words: “As in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” —Quoted from Christ’s words at Matthew 24:38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wine is a beverage or liquor made from the juice of grapes and allowed to ferment. The alcoholic content thereof produces intoxication when used to excess. There could be no wine without fermentation, the result of a natural law which the great Creator God made. In the Genesis account, chapter nine, it is recorded that after the flood Noah planted a vineyard, gathered the grapes that grew therein, and made wine from them, and drank the wine and became intoxicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To say that Noah did that because he was ignorant of the natural law of fermentation would be foolish. The record shows he planted the vineyard with full knowledge that wine by fermentation would result, otherwise why did he press out the juice from the grapes and wait for it to ferment before he drank it? Had he desired only the grape juice he would have pressed out the juice and drunk it immediately. The flood had nothing to do with the operation of fermentation, as has been improperly claimed. God was not displeased with Noah and did not subject him to a fine, imprisonment or other punishment for making and possessing wine; but long thereafter gave to him the very highest commendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Read Ezekiel 14:14; also in Hebrews, chapter 11, Noah specifically is commended for his faithfulness and devotion as a witness for Jehovah, and it is plainly stated that he had God’s full approval. But religious clergy and prohibitionists denounce him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Centuries later Christ Jesus performed miracles for the purpose of establishing the faith of the people in Him as the Messiah sent from God. Would it be at all reasonable that in the performance of miracles for this purpose Jesus would use anything in connection therewith that God had prohibited or that was at all displeasing to God? Certainly not; because He repeatedly stated He came to do, not His own will, but His Father’s, who sent Him. Therefore what Jesus did had the full approval of God, His Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first miracle Jesus performed was that of making wine. The record thereof is found in John </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font9">1-11. He was present at a marriage feast at which all the guests were drinking wine which the bridegroom had provided. The supply on hand was exhausted. Being called up? on to do soatething for the guests in the way of supplying wine, Jesus then and there performed His first great miracle by making wine from water. The divine record shows it was even better than the other wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Pharisees, priests and scribes and lawyers who composed the clergy when Jesus was on earth, and whom Jesus denounced as hypocrites, accused Jesus of being a winebibber, as recorded at Matthew 11:19. Manifestly they did this because Jesus indulged in the moderate use of fermented wine. Had He been drinking plain grape juice they would have said nothing about it. Had God ruled that the making, possession and use of wine should be prohibited, Jesus certainly would not have drunk any of it ^whatsoever. He kept God’s law fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just before His death Jesus established the Memorial of His own death by the breaking of bread and by pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font9">duringwine and inviting His disciples to drink of it. (Matthew 26:27) Further-: more, He commanded His followers to continue to perform this Memorial once each year until the coming of God's kingdom. If prohibitionists had their way, no wine could be had for use in obedience to the'Lord’s commandment. The fact that the Lord used wine on this occasion is conclusive proof that its making, possession and use has God’s approval. This instruction is given to one of God’s servants : “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.”— 1 Timothy 5: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A great amount of sorrow and suffering amongst men has been by reason of the excessive use of wine and strong drink. The use of wine is authorized by the Holy Scriptures, but the use thereof must be in moderation. Manifestly it is proper to use wine in moderation, otherwise the Lord* would not have caused to be recorded, with His approval, the use thereof. There is a wide distinction between the moderate use of wine and the use of tobacco in any form. Tobacco is not Scripturally approved under any condition, whereas wine is frequently spoken of with approval in the Word of God. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Moderation in all things is the proper and Scriptural course. Philippians 4:5 reads: “Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.” An immoderate eater is a glutton. A drunkard and a glutton are placed in the same class, and both are disapproved by the Lord. (See Proverbs 23:21; Deuteronomy 21: 20.) The Scriptural admonition to God’s servants is to take “a little wine for thy stomach’s sake”, but <sup>c</sup>do not be given to too much wine’. (1 Timothy 5:23; 3: 8) If one finds he cannot take a moderate amount of wine for his wellbeing, then he should avoid it altogether. If it works injury to himself or to any other person, then it should not be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is written, at Proverbs 23: 20, 21: “Be not among wunebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: for the drunkard and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, l»4t </span><span class="font9">the glutton shall come to poverty ; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.” Manifestly Jesus used wine and ate food, and that furnished an excuse for the Pharisees to charge Him with being a glutton and a winebibber and a friend of publicans and sinners. Concerning this matter Jesus said: “The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and pinners.” (Matthew 11:19) Of course, the Pharisees falsely charged Him with excesses, because Jesus always does right. Proverbs 23: 31 reads: “Look not thou upon the wine w’hen it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it mov-eth itself aright.” According to Rotherham’s translation this text reads: “Do not look on wine when it becometh red, when it giveth in the cup its sparkle, glideth down smoothly.” Some have insisted that this text means that no one should even look at wine; but that is an unreasonable construction of the scripture. Wine made from certain grapes is red at all times and does not change its color. When a man, however, has imbibed wine to excess he begins to see “red”. Stated in modern phrase, then, this text really means: Do not look on wine to use it when you see red, that is, when everything looks red to you. When it looks red to you and slides down easily, then it is time to let it alone; you have had enough or too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When one is engaged in the service of the Lord, strong drink in any form should be avoided. To those’Levites who served in the priest’s office God gave commandment: “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations ; and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean.” (Leviticus 10:9,10) The clear inference here is that it was not improper to drink moderately when not serving in the tabernacle. It cannot be successfully argued that these scriptures, because taken'from the “Old Testament”, no longer apply. The entire Bible was written for the instruction of men in righteousness, as stated at 2 Timothy 3:15-17. When one is engaged in God’s service he should avoid wine and other intoxicating drinks. That is not the proper time for such things. At other times, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">be moderate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Theocratic Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• The apostle Peter wrote, “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”; and all the signs the Lord Jesus gave concerning the establishment of that kingdom are coming to pass.' Using the current phrase, we may call that kingdom God’s new order, though the worti does not cover what is purposed by the Kingdom. That the world’s troubles are greater than can be contended with, even taking no account of the inherent weaknesses of men, is apparent to everyone who will allow himself to consider the position and the condition of the world. It is of that kingdom Jehovah’s witnesses give witness, both to warn the people and to witness to the goodness and mercy of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The apostle Paul, mentioning the Devil, Satan, says, ‘We are not ignorant of his devices,” (2 Corinthians 2:11) Undoubtedly all this talk of a “new order” is part of his scheme, its intent being to discount the message of the new heavens and new earth—God’s arrangement of His kingdom. When the Japanese representative. Matsuoka was in Borne he spoke bold words of the “new order” which Germany and Italy are to establish in the West and Japan establish in the East—they purpose to control the world! and set it in good shape. The pope will help them, and that will be the Papacy’s contribution; the so-called “Protestants” will rally to the support of the Papacy in the general interests of mankind—and in their own, and all the men of good intent will want to share in the settlement for the world’s peace and readjustment. There will be few amongst all these who will see that Satan, the enemy of God and His kingdom, and man’s enemy, is the chief instigator, and is the deceiver of the whole Avorld, as it is said at Beve-lation 12: 9, “That’old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.”—J. Hemery, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Church’s “Meddling” in Politics</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Times</span><span class="font9"> (London) quotes the pope’s envoy in Britain as telling the Scots, in effect, that the reason why the “Church” meddles in politics is that that is the Church’s business and chief aim in life. The envoy is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“If the Church has a Divine mandate to lead the world and teach it to behave according to the code and creed of Christ, you may, on occasion, be just as absurd in asking that question as if you asked whether a barber meddled in haircutting or a doctor in doctoring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Blessing of Weapons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Kennedy thinks it all right for Italian priests to bless Italian weapons, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The American Freeman</span><span class="font9"> can’t quite figure it out. It speaks of similar blessings in Germany, Poland, Belgium, France and Spain, and remarks: “The weapons of the'enemy have always been blessed by priests—the enemies of freedom, tolerance, decency, humanitarianism, democracy and progressiveness. Did it ever occur to Kennedy that a church dedicated to Jesus need not have blessed anyone’s weapons?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How the People Love Demonism!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ How the people do love the demons, their worst enemies! And how the demons do love to kid the people that look to them for guidance! The Ballards had their fling in Los Angeles, and finally got into the courts. Ballard himself posed as the great I Am, or at least that he was in touch with Him. He died, thus helping humanity considerably. His wife was supposed to be Joan of Arc, while her son Donald was Lafayette. The idea appears to be that it is a good thing to cash in on some other person’s fame or popularity. The demons like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Pine Mountain church, Kentucky, the demonism takes another form. An unidentified magazine gives a record of the demon-worship from which the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Between the rough pulpit and the first row of benches, shouting, ecstatic men and women took up serpents—two rattlesnakes and a copperhead—danced and pranked with them. Men held their hands in flames and appeared to take no hurt. Shivering and sweating, a man strode and skipped about the rostrum uttering unintelligible syllables—“the unknown tongue.” Women, eyes shut, hands waving, wheeled in slow backward circles, their feet pounding the floor; they jerked spasmodically, with the effect of snapping the spine as one would a whip. All sang a monotonous, almost tuneless chant; clapping hands, stamping feet, cymbals and a tambourine marked the time in a powerful rhythm that beat heavily on the senses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many spirit mediums or clairvoyants are as unprincipled as the demons for whom they act. In Garfield, N. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">J.,</span><span class="font9"> a spirit predicted John Heil would soon die, and the best thing he could do with his $5,000 house was to turn it over to the medium, which he did. But he did not die. He got well; and so he came into court to ask that he might have his house back. If you want to keep well and sane in this evil day, avoid every form of demonism as you would the plague.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“See the Clairvoyants”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Dr. U. L. Ghilini, who several years ago exposed a ministerial mill in Los Angeles after it had ordained a duck, and who now has a regular job in Washington exposing frauds, says that if one wants to get ahead in Washington he should “see the clairvoyants, for these exponents of the mystic arts hold the baL ance of power in the capital today”. Some of his other expressions are, “If you contact one palmist or one crystal-gazer you automatically contact about 50 legislators directly or through their wives or sweethearts,” and, “I estimate the readers collect ten percent of the salaries of fifty percent of the Washington political strata, both men and women.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Caught in the Snare of the Demons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Not believing the Scriptures, that “the dead know not any thing” and that when a person dies “his thoughts perish”, the “Very Reverend” W. R. Matthews, dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, said that “some persons survived bodily death but the investigations could not show that all persons did”. The “Very Reverend” has been caught in the snare of the demons, as is plainly evidenced from his further statement that “some persons apparently make contacts with some source of energy that reinforces natural endowments and gives them unification of purpose that makes them most formidable”. Those “sources of energy” are evil spirits, devils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonism Taught at American University</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Mind reading, or “extra-sensory perception”, now taught at American University, Washington, D.C., is nothing more nor less yian demonism, and all parents should see to it that none of their children are brought under such influences. Indeed, the whole world today has run mad after demonism, in hundreds of forms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ After nearly completing this city there was trouble brewing, so I worked the police station and courthouse in an endeavor to have a show-down fight, and leave the town clear for the friends to work after the special pioneers left. The police chief acted friendly, but the mayor came in and said, “This is the vicious gang, distributing propaganda to foment dissension among the people. This is the bunch we have been looking for. This gang must be stopped.” He then took the chief into a private conference for a few minutes, and when the chief came back he was mad all over and said, “How many of you are there ?” Answer: “We are servants of Jehovah, and each one can answer only for himself. However, Revelation 7: 9 will answer that question.” Then the chief said, “Well, if you want to preach in this town you will have to go and build yourself a church.” Answer: “I would not w'ant to be in a place that the Lord says, at Matthew 24: 2, he is going to destroy now shortly. Furthermore, I have here a Supreme Court decision, delivered by Chief Justice Hughes, that shows that we have a right to do this work.” The chief said, “I don’t care. You cannot do this work in Vicksburg.” That night we brushed up on Scriptural and legal defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following day Carmen Golden was picked up at 5:45 p.m. and by 6:00 p.m. had been tried and sentenced to 90 days and $100 fine and was in a chain gang. When the police were called by ’phone they denied knowing anything about Carmen. Later, about 9:30 p.m., when the police were ’phoned again they said, “No, we have never heard of him. Where are you at?” I said, “None of your business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscriber -was then called on who readily volunteered to go to the police station. When he got there and asked about Carmen the police grabbed him and were going to lock him up, but they soon found out their mistake. He was informed that the whole pioneer group would be in jail by morning. The police then tried to get us all by following him in a prowl-car, but were again fooled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As we could not reach the telegraph office down town without getting picked up, we stopped at a home where a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study had been conducted for 32 years. The conductor was secretary for the company. When he ■was informed of the battle and permission was asked to use his telephone, to call the Western Union, so that the Society might be informed, he said, “No, no! I can’t be getting mixed up in anything like this; you will have to go somewhere else,” which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the morning the whole group went out and called on every new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> subscriber, of which there were about 50, also every one in the city that showed any interest in the Kingdom message was called upon and asked to call the officials of the city and urge them to discontinue persecuting Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By 5:30 p.m. I had no names left to call on, so began the regular house-to-house witness. About the second house I called at the lady showed interest, and when she heard about the battle she said, “Hold everything until I get my old man and you tell him just what you told me.” When she got her husband, a big, tall man, he crossed the street and called another man, a little, short man, and when they had been informed the little man looked up and said, “Where in hell do they get that stuff, locking our pilgrims up ’when they come to town? we’ll go down there and tear that jail down.” At the police station, the little man, being</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Previous to the conference a snooper was sent to visit every preacher and quietly inspect his library for the forbidden books. Then at the conference the guilty were firmly warned.</span></p>

He wants to know more about our work and why they are all against us. He related a conversation with a colored Baptist preacher.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Zeal Peculiar to God’s House</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ I am writing to ask if it would be possible for me to work on the streets of the nearest large town, w’hich, so it happens, is not in the territory of the unit with which I am connected. My reason for making the request is that I can work' only in a large place, as I am in a wheel chair, which I control by pushing it around with my feet. [See illustration. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Ed.] I</span><span class="font9"> am in this condition as a result of vaccination for typhoid fever several years ago. I am very anxious to do this, as I have so few opportunities of publishing the Kingdom message.—Verneta Pierce, Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Un-Ajnericans at Hammond, Louisiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ At Hammond, Louisiana, un-Ameri-cans put four of Jehovah’s witnesses, one of them a woman, out of town for preaching the gospel of God’s Kingdom in their midst. Name of inciting priest is unknown.</span></p><img src="g_E_19410528_files/g_E_19410528-6.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:156pt;">

<p><span class="font9">♦ Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers of Louisiana, in semiannual assembly, write that they see the “strange work” of the Lord’s people coming to a close and are determined as never before to push the battle to the gate. Though deprived of the use of halls for their assemblies, thrown into jail, fined, mobbed and otherwise opposed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, they are glad to have the opportunity of being publishers of The Theocracy and determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with all other Theocracy publishers until the work is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Worshiped the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ When I tried to talk to a lady about the great Creator, she said to me, in substance, “You folks are always talking about Jehovah this and Jehovah that, and it is enough to make one crazy.” When she stopped for breath I asked her, “If you do not worship Jehovah God, what God do you worship?” and she almost took the wind out of my sails by saying, “I worship.the god of this world.” I referred her to 2 Corinthians 4:4, where it shows that he is the Devil.— Contributed.'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Americans in Florida</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Americans have been discovered </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">Florida. One of them is in the editorial office of the Ocala </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Banner.</span><span class="font9"> In an editorial on “Legislated Patriotism” he takes note of the example of the city of Eustis, following the lead of Orlando, in admittedly passing legislation specifically directed against Jehovah’s witnesses, and providing a $500 fine or 60 days in jail for anybody who for conscientious reasons refuses to salute the flag. The Ocala editor wonders if the folks at Eustis and Orlando ever heard of that interesting provision in the Constitution that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Matter of Principle</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Youth Crusade at Tampa</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ On the street corners of Tampa several of Jehovah's witnesses had taken their fctand and wen: offering _77te </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-tower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font9"> They were encircled, on two different corners, by bands of young people known as the “Youth Crusade”, which latter lustily sang “Onward, Christian Soldiers” and invited the witnesses to leave, informing them that they did not appreciate their presence. The witnesses calmly informed the disturbers that they did not appreciate the presence of the Crusaders and, as the witnesses of Jehovah were there first, they would remain; and they did. With that the intruders walked away. Stand your ground, as is your right, or you will find you have no liberties at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Liberty-Lovers in Louisiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The Louisiana Supreme Court sustained Jehovah’s witnesses in their right to distribute Kingdom literature, in a ease of seizure of an automobile and books. The Louisiana League for the Preservation of Constitutional Kights and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief, amicus curiae, in the case. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ If it were not so pathetic it wmuld be comical to hear Brown Whatley, chairman of the board of education of Jacksonville, Florida, say that it is unfortunate that the school children have to suffer for a matter of principle, but that older persons must show that they<sup>7</sup> have no principle, and go through with this flag-salute business, right or wrong; for if they do not do so it will be an admission that everyone else who salutes the flag is sacrilegious, lie came so near the truth that he fell all over it.</span></p><img src="g_E_19410528_files/g_E_19410528-9.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:157pt;">
<p><span class="font7">Kingdom Hall, Gary, Indiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“We Were Catholics”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ We were Catholics and believed the Devil’s lies regarding &quot;purgatory” and eternal torment. It was a blessing to us when some of Jehovah’s witnesses called and through them we obtained the books which explain the Bible. When we had studied the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font9"> it made us so happy to know that God is love, and that it is the Devil that brings all the woes and suffering. I am now a Kingdom publisher and was with other of Jehovah’s people cast into prison in Rayne, Louisiana, for bringing the wonderful Kingdom message to the people. It is a great privilege to be able to serve God. We now know that religion commercializes the Word of God and that religion and Christianity are not the same. We are so happy to be able to teach our little girl Christianity. We are wholly and unreservedly for The Theocracy, and will remain loyal regardless of all opposition. We are grateful to God for the spiritual food that has been provided for us through the columns of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font9">—Mr. and Mrs. Duhart Duhon, Louisiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Chief Caters to Hell-Raisers</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The following is the conversation between the chief of police of Lebanon, Tennessee, and a Theocratic publisher who was distributing magazines on the streets of that town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chief: Come out here a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publisher: Get your copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font9"> Just five cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chief: Do you have a license to do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publisher: No; T don’t need one, as the Supreme Court has held that we may do this work without a license, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chief: Come on over to City Hall and get a license; the people are raising hell about you folks and these magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publisher: No, I can’t do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chief: Get off the street and get out of town 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Later on the chief had a similar conversation with another publisher, but none of the publishers were intimidated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">About two days later the chief was reported to be seriously ill. The following Saturday the'magazines went like hot cakes.—R. K. Moyer, Tennessee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Well-soused Religious Gentleman</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ At Pratt City, Alabama, a well-soused religious gentleman ordered his wife to get Judge Rutherford’s books out of his house; and when she fell on her knees before the Lord he came over and hit her on the head, ordering her not to pray in his house. The lady summoned the police. They came, and the loving husband told them his wife was a Jehovahite and two of them were in jail. The police replied that they knew nothing about that, but they did know his wife had a perfect right to keep and to read any books she desired, that it was none of his business, and' that if they had to return they would pick him up and land him in the calaboose. The religious hero then subsided.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Told “His” People Not to Read</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ At Lonaconing, Md., one of Jehovah’s witnesses offered a preacher a Bible and a bound book together, on a 50c contribution. The preacher declined and stated he was warning his flock “not to read them books”. The advertisement worked • fine. It resulted in placing 651 booklets with his flock, two members of which stated they had been praying earnestly one night for light and truth. The next morning the booklets were at the door.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Britain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain Resists the “New Order”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Britain is not in the “new order”— not yet, Canada was, pushed overboard and Canadian nickel is reaching Germany by way of Japan, One shipment went as late as November 25, 1940. The shipments leave regularly, but not from Canadian ports. Common sense (and news reports too) indicates that the shipments go via Japanese ships from southern ports, along with United States copper which also reaches Germany by the same means. Both of these metals are absolutely necessary to Germany at war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Japanese-American Review</span><span class="font9"> states that Japanese oil supplies will now rise to more than thrice former shipments, as a result of arrangements made with the (American) Standard Vacuum Oil Company and the Rising Sun Petroleum Company, Japan subsidiary of British Shell; and Joseph Curran, president of the National 'Maritime Union, says, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Pilot:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pot</span><span class="font7"> the past three months, British, Norwegian and American ships have been carrying high test gasoline and the best grades of lubricating and fuel oils to Spain, We know that Spain does not consume more than onefourth of that oil. The rest is going to Italy and Germany. Thus, while it is almost unbelievable, it is a fact that Italian and German mechanized divisions are operating by means of British oil from Venezuela and American oil from Texas. British and American products are helping to kill British workers. Whose war is this, anyhow? Although the copper industry in Chile is controlled by Great Britain, copper ingots are being carried to Spain on British, Norwegian and American ships, whence they are sent to Italy and Germany, Yet, Britain is at war with the Axis powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In his book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Inside Europe</span><span class="font9"> John Gunther says that in December, 1934, “The Bank of Rugland granted a $3,750,-000 credit,to Germany in order to facilitate the mobilization of German com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">mercial credits, i.e., so that Germany might have means (new credit) to meet old debts and build airplanes that can cross the English Channel in seven minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> contains a two-column story by a distinguished Russian publicist in which the claim is made that 80,000 German troops perished in two attempts made to land on British shores, the defense weapon in each case being huge seas of burning oil and gasoline. The story avers that thousands of dead German soldiers were washed ashore and that there were mutinies in the German army over a third attempt to face the string of oil and gasoline tanks planted in the channel. A later story by another writer is that 75,000 were burned severely enough to require hospitalization and that there were several executions of soldiers who expressed opposition to further attempts at invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The British are showing a courage and spirit that is magnificent. They would far rather die on their feet than live under Roman Catholic Hitler. It is literally true that in Coventry and many other places women went back into roofless homes, used their wrecked furniture for kindling wood, and contrived to prepare meals so that their husbands could have them as usual. Men did harvesting w<sup>T</sup>ork with bombs falling all about them. Men that came back from Dunkerque were fighting alongside Greeks in Albania. Kaiser Wilhelm said recently, “Hitler is the damnedest fool to fight the British.” He'ought to know. Twenty-five thousand fire bombs were dropped in a single air raid over Portsmouth. One plane may drop 800 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The British authorities anticipated 30,000 casualties a month among civilians, but the total for any one month never exceeded more than 12,000. The surgeons are doing wonderful work in putting new faces on men whose own</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">were burned off. A flap of skin is taken from the stomach, grafted to the arm and after three weeks is brought up and placed over the face. Educational opportunities are being taken into the air raid shelters. Gramophones and games are in much use. Quite likely the grand message of The Theocracy is often heard in such places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">German authorities say that they are willing the British should live and do their work as a freight-carrier. Their once-announced program was to turn Protestant Ulster over to Catholic Eire, transfer Gibraltar to Spain, Malta to Italy, Cyprus to Greece, Palestine to the Arabs, the Sudan to Egypt, the Falklands to Argentina, and Bermuda to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Bulletin of British Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of Home Security </span><span class="font9">♦ The following bulletin of the British Ministry of Home Security, published in the London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express</span><span class="font9"> for January 19, 1941, shows to what pathetic straits this so-called “civilization'’ has been brought by its disregard of the Scriptures;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Before, During and After the Raid </span><span class="font6">KEEPING WARM AND COMFORTABLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN YOUR SHELTER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">--AND THE HELP THAT IS READY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IF YOUR HOME IS HIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you are sleeping in an Anderson or brick surface shelter, every extra, bit of immediate comfort and convenience that you can arrange in your shelter makes it easier for you to stand up to the bombing. Here are some hints taken from leaflets which are being issued to all shelterers by local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE EARLY EVENING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For reading or knitting, a good light is necessary. Try a candlelamp or nightlights. These are good for the eyes. Oil lamps arc dangerous, as they may get spilled by shock from bombs. They make the air foul, too. If you do use one, be sure to put it out before going to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HEATING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never have a coke or other brazier in the shelter. They give off dangerous fumes. Oil stoves are also a source of danger, as they use up the oxygen which you need for breathing. A candle heater is useful. Put the candle in a flowerpot, and then put a second flowerpot over the top. Raise the lower pot slightly from the ground. Try a hot water bottle or a hot brick in the bed. Heat the brick in the oven for two hours first and wrap it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">GETTING TO SLEEP</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A warm drink helps, particularly with children. Remember that when you are not sleeping on a thick mattress you need as much underneath yon as on top. Have a good thick layer of newspapers or brown paper to lie on. Paper is draught proof. It is most important that bedding should be thoroughly aired every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN THE NIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have something to eat with you, in case you get peckish in the night. Keep plenty of warm outdoor clothes beside you, in case you have to go out of the shelter. If you feel a draught, hang a curtain in front of the bunk. Wear your ear plugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AFTER THE RAID</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Have your plans made</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Make plans </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font7"> to go and stay with friends living near, but not too near, in case your house is destroyed. They should also arrange now to come to you if their house is knocked out. It’s comforting to feel that everything is fixed up, just in case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Help is ready</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If your home is damaged, there is a great deal of help ready for you. Full arrangements have been made to give you food and shelter, clothes and money if necessary, and to find <sup>f </sup>you somewhere to live. If you have not been able to make arrangements with friends, go straight to the emergency Rest Centre. The ivardensand police know where it is. As/c </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Labor for Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ In an article in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American Federa-tionist,</span><span class="font9"> official magazine of the American Federation of Labor, Ernest Bevin, Brit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ ish minister of Labor, says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the British labor movement we were under no delusion as to what would happen once Hitler came into power. We knew that everything labor stood for would go if his regime succeeded. His object was to make a slave state. And what ruthless methods he adopted in order to achieve it! Not merely the crushing of the trade unions but also the knout, death or the concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thing has followed in his train wherever he has gone. The Nazis have taken trade union leaders and put them to death. They have stolen the money and assets of the movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We feel in our very bones that we are the bastions of liberty. The words ‘they shall not pass' have greater meaning than ever before because we know that we are preserving not only our own liberty but that of the whole Commonwealth. Indeed, in saving ourselves we save every lover of liberty in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it is useless to underestimate either the power of our enemy or the task we are called on to perform. He has dragooned forces, subjugated millions of people to his will and created a vast arsenal, utilizing the labor of a population of nearly 200,000,000 people, many of whom hate him and would turn their weapons upon him tomorrow if only the opportunity presented itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We in this tight little island have a working population of 17,000,000. We have tp face the output of his formidable labor force and simultaneously bring goods and raw materials from overseas. And bravely the mercantile marine of our own and allied nations are doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You would hardly think the war would affect women’s heels, but it does. The British Timber Control wants women to wear lower heels and save wood.. The Leather Control wants trimmings omitted that waste leather. The Wool and Silk Control wants fewer such materials used for evening shoes. And the Ministry of Supply wants plain shoes, to save the skilled operatives’ time. These changes will be beneficial to the women. High heels are a menace to life and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All British women between 20 and 21 and all men between 40 and 45 were</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941 </span><span class="font9">called for registration, to take the place Of male workers called into the armed forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mobile canteens are now in service all over England, Men are stationed everywhere, and the canteens go to them with food of every sort, and with soap, chewing gum, cigarettes, shoestrings, buttons, ink, tooth paste, razor blades, combs, stamps, and socks. The women drivers give the soldiers writing paper, bring them books and newspapers, do their shopping in town, mend their socks, and take their washing away. The canteens cost $1,500. They sell sandwiches to the men at 3c and provide a good square meal for 12c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the duration of the war the prime minister may compel workers to work twelve hours per day seven days a week; to stop production of luxuries; to favor export trade at cost of domestic trade; to control all wealth; to regulate the hours and wages of every worker in the kingdom; to send labor wherever needed; to draft all unemployed and order them into the mines; to compel home owners to give lodging to workers without compensation; to inspect.business and private premises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the war is on there must be no flying of either kites or balloons in Britain. They might be used by the evil-disposed as,helps to the Germans to show where to drop bombs. Also, no foreigner may now have in his possession a map on a scale exceeding twelve miles to the inch, or a guidebook giving road routes or information. Britons themselves may not possess maps on a scale exceeding one mile to the inch, except by special permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Graf Spee</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ You remember the tale of the British captains who went out to the cemetery in Montevideo to honor the memory of the 36 German sailors who were killed in the sea fight? Well, one of the graves was opened and it was thereupon discovered that 36 coffins were buried with</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">enough machine guns and ammunition to take Brazil, if they could have been got into the hands of the 1,000,000 or more German citizens- of that country. The men slain in the Graf Spee fight went down when the ship was scuttled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The secrets of the Graf Spee are gradually coming into possession of the British naval experts, but it is a slow job taking the wreck apart, to avoid explosion of the magazine. The deck plates were made of a special steel alloy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ships are life to Britain now. It is said that there is one ship in use now that is made of the bow of one vessel and the stern of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Mediterranean a merchantman was hit by a torpedo at the extreme end of the bow of the vessel. The submarine then came to the surface, and the merchantman, seeing it was in a position to be rammed, put on full speed, struck the submarine broadside, turned it over and sank it with all on board. The merchantman herself put into Malta and was fixed up so it could complete its voyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The island of Malta, which lies only a few miles from Sicily, was still holding out bravely after the Italians had bombed it 203 times and the Germans had published pictures of the supposedly great damage done. The garrison and naval station were in continuous use, and the civil population was confident of ultimate British victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Raids Across the Channel</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ British night raids across the channel netted the raiding parties prisoners of German officers and men in Ostend, Boulogne, Calais and Dieppe. These are taken to Britain for questioning and imprisonment. Tn one place (Ostend) the raiders broke up a ball and took all the men off to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Up to January 1, 1941, the British airmen had made 1,400 attacks on German industrial areas, with an average of more than five trips to each city or town in which are located the principal industries. More than 500 of these raids were</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">made in the Ruhr area, which is Germany’s Pittsburgh or Birmingham. The most famous railroad marshaling yards there were visited 82 times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ralph Ingersoll gives a choice collection of the slang in use in 1940 in the Royal Air Force. He describes an airman as saying of an enemy airman, “I gave him a squirt in the greenhouse and wrote him off.” The “squirt” was a burst of machine-gun fire; the “greenhouse” was the cockpit, glass enclosed; and the man that was 'written off was finished where he sat at the controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe You Have a Heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Maybe you have a heart, and if you have, maybe you saw the pictures of the bomb-shocked babies that go into hysterics when they hear the air sirens, and that lose their power to walk or even to balance themselves, and maybe you wept, and if you did, you had company. The Lord will put an end to all that. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When taken into the country, and taught anew to walk, the little patients recover rapidly and rarely show symptoms of relapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No sooner had the raids tapered off than the debris was removed from London’s streets and the salvaging of the damaged buildings was under way. Streets were repaved, windows and doors were fitted with wood, tin and beaver-, board, debris was sorted, and in a very short time London was ready to go on again with its fight for liberty and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Good-bye nothing.” That is what British laboring classes say when the Nazis blow their slum dwellings into fragments. “That’s the end of that*: we shall get better homes in the future.” Indeed they have been promised better homes. But their only real and lasting hope, if they did but know it, is in the kingdom for which Jesus taught His followers to pray—-Jehovah’s kingdom, which shall for ever put an end to such horrible things as are now going on in the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased Penalties for Looting</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ With property losses running into the hundreds of millions, the people of England are not temporizing with those who steal their belongings when the roofs are blown off their homes. In bne instance four members of a famous bomb-disposal squad received sentences of riine months at hard labor for stealing shaving brushes and soap worth, all together, not more than three dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The British Government is now taking 60 percent of the national income in taxes and is expected to take 85 percent in two years, if the war goes on. The war is costing Britain $12,000,000,000 a year, with ruin and destruction on all sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fire-ruined financial section of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">London is undergoing the greatest era of land speculation in its history. Brokers are buying up the bombed sites, and such scandals have resulted that the Government had to set up a committee to check their operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">600,000 Tons of Idle Shipping</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It does not set too well here to see the British making frantic appeals to us for tonnage while at the same time wasting it in order to keep up business as usual. For instance, London is routing oil tankers around Africa to Persia when they could shoot across the Atlantic to Venezuela and get oil in a third of the time— saving two-thirds of the tonnage by shortening the haul. It’s the desire to preserve traditional trade arrangements that seems to be causing part of the trouble. In all 600,000 tons of idle shipping are available here. Sluggish bureaucracy in London is preventing most of it from going into service.—Raymond Clapper, in New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Liberty-Haters</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The most comic part of the affair was the attitude toward America. We dared not insult America, for we were naturally as keen on getting American help as is a drowning man on catching a deck chair ... In their ignorance many people came to believe that it was the duty of the Americans to come over and help, and, what was more astonishing still, it was represented to them as a matter of life and death, not to us, but to themselves. The Americans were told (Heaven knows whether any of them believed it!) that if the Germans, Austrians, Bohemians, Slovenes, Croats, Bulgarians, Turks, etc., won in their push against the English, French and Italians, that if the half-baked won against the baked, the next thing would be a sailing of the conquerors over the sea for the rude domination of Scranton, Pa. Fiddlesticks-cnds! But people did really talk like that. They shook their lingers at the United States, and said: &quot;It will be your turn next!”— Hillaire . Belloc, famous liberty-hating British Catholic writer, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Cruise of the Nona,</span><span class="font9"> published in 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a heritage of centuries of hatred will accomplish is summarized by Jay Franklin in the Kansas City </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font9"> as follows: “Neither in the days of Wolf Tone nor in those of Sir Roger Casement did the Irish allow themselves to be terrorized. It remained for the De Valera government to bring the whole race of lighting Irish to a mood in which they are ready to risk slavery to the Nazis rather than incur some immediate danger by supplying bases to the navy which protects them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At a German home in Dublin, Eire, police found the effects of a roomer consisting of an open used parachute, a code book and papers relating to wireless telegraphy, a wireless transmitting and receiving set, information regarding Irish harbors, airdromes, roads, bridges and landing grounds, also $20,000 in United States currency. The roomer had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is no wonder that both Irishmen and Englishmen are highly suspicious of each other’s intentions. During the war of 1914-1918 Trish rebels traveled on German submarines and even provided fuel and information to the U-boat commanders. Whether anything like that is going on today cannot be said with authenticity, but northern officials from Ulster and British radio operators have complained about suspicious shortwave within Eire. That the Nazis maintain a large intelligence staff throughout Eire, shielded by Irish radicals, is well known to British scouts.—Perdix, in the Spring-Held </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Australia, New Zealand and Fiji have also taken their stand against liberty, though nominally on Britain’s side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Tn Manchester, England, lives a fifteenyear-old boy, Eric Tench, who has been to the hospital fifty times with broken limbs. So brittle are his bones that on one occasion he reached out to touch his mother, his hand caught her frock, and a hone snapped. It is a peculiar form of rickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tn Britain, where sheep are plentiful, tufts of wool are often left on hedges and fences. In the spring the children gather these valuable fibers and after adequate treatment they are used to good purpose as fillers for quilts, so that woolgathering is quite a proper expression after all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Britain had its worst railway tie-up in history in the winter of 1941. In one instance passengers spent thirty-seven hours in the huge snowdrifts that blocked the main line and all its branches. Rescuers loaded with food had difficulty in finding the lost trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the seal of the City of Plymouth, England, occur the words &quot;Turns For-tissima Est Nomen Jehova”; which, being interpreted, is “A very strong tower is the name of Jehovah”.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Roosevelt Among the Prophets</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ “For three long years I have been going up and down this country preaching that government costs too much. I shall not stop that preaching. ... I propose to use tliis position of high responsibility to discuss up and down the country at all seasons and at all times the duty of reducing taxes. . . . For three long years the Federal Government has been on the road toward bankruptcy. Too often in'recent history liberal governments have been wrecked on the rocks of loose fiscal policy. We must avoid this danger. . . . The [Hoover] spending, my friends, is the most reckless and extravagant pace that I have been able to discover in the fiscal record of any peacetime government anywhere, any time. Taxes are paid in the sweat of every man who labors. If these taxes are excessive they are reflected in idle factories and tax-sold<sub>;</sub> farms and in hordes of hungry people tramping the streets and seeking jobs in vain. Our workers may never see a tax bill, but they pay it. They pay -in deductions from wages, in increased cost of what they buy or (as now) in broad unemployment throughout the land. . . . Let us have the courage to stop borrowing to meet continuing deficits. Stop the deficits.”—Franklin D. Roosevelt, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jefferson, The 'Forgotten Man,</span><span class="font9"> by Samuel B. Pettengill, pages 88, 89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Pegler Pans President</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The effects of the trade of .destroyers with Britain and of the military protectorate over Canada may be desirable, but the manner of putting across these deals was so shysteresque that only a nation already reconciled to cunning and mocking dishonesty would accept them without protest. There will be no protest worth President Roosevelt’s notice, because the people long ago wearily abandoned principle and surrendered to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 28, 1941 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font9">what-the-hell philosophy, which holds that any crookedness short of downright criminality is all right if it is clever and if it produces results. This attitude of resignation is the result of constant attacks on the morals of the country—first on one front, then on another—ranging in magnitude from a petty but scandalous deal in faked philatelic rarities to the advantage of a few individuals who knew very well what they were doing, to a plain, defiant violation of law and the Constitution in which the attorney general of the United States delivered a leering insult to Truth. It will be noticed that most of the comment on the destroyer trade recognizes the dishonesty of the transaction but accepts the results and justifies it on the ground of necessity. The spirit of the trade was the spirit of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin and, incidentally, of the New Deal, and, worse luck, the prevailing spirit of the citizens of the United States.—Westbrook Pegler, in the New Haven </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Register.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Blood of a Dictator</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The blood of a dictator has been boiling in the veins of Franklin Delano Roosevelt ever since he made the pronouncement, in Madison Square Garden, in 1936, that his opponents had met their match and were now about to meet their master. Only a man of infinite selfconceit could ever have made such a foolish statement. Has not the wmrld had enough self-advertised “saviors” in the past 6,000 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Says Amos Pinchot</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Says Amos Pinchot: “Mr. Roosevelt once did some fine things, and the people are not ungrateful. In his first term he ran a good race. But in his second term ambition bumped him and he ran off the track. He has lost both his stride and his head. He has had his day and should be turned out to grass.”</span></p>

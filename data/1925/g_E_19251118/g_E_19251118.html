The Indians make good citizens. Most of them work on the roads, and at odd times resort to their old trades of hunting and fishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why Financiers Make Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE capital stock of all the banks of all kinds in the United States is two and one-third billions of dollars; their surplus is a like amount, the grand total being slightly less than five billions of dollars. But these same banks have outstanding loans amounting to more than twenty-five billions of dollars; and if the average interest on these loans is only six percent, the annual interest income is one and one-half billions, or over sixty percent on the capital invested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">City Freight Must Go Below</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE cities of London and New York are both discussing means to get the trucks off the streets by building freight subways, far below the levels of the passenger subways, which will connect all the principal freight termini with the largest freight-producing and freight-receiving points. It is stated that New York City receives annually 140,000 freight cars of food, which would be enough to make a solid train with the engine in Denver and the caboose in New York. All this food is now trucked through the city^s streets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> contains an interesting study of the suicide problem. Four men commit suicide to one woman. The Pacific Coast states hold the highest record for suicides in the United States, and Massachusetts the smallest. Education frequently promotes suicide, but ill health is the principal cause of self-destruction. Germany has the highest suicide rate of any country; then come France, Denmark and the United States.

The wind whipped his shirt to ribbons, but he made the trip safely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Three Billions in Automobiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">OME idea of the size of the automobile industry may be gathered from the fact that the wholesale value of the cars produced in this country in 1924 was a little over three billions of dollars, or a little over a thousand dollars for the average car. There are now sixty thousand buses in operation here, of which twenty thousand are operated by schools.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Plan for Saving Niagara</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fTUIE remedy proposed for saving Niagara</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Falls is to erect an obstruction in the river at some suitable point above the V-shaped notch through which so much of the water is flowing. This will spread the water out to the wings, where the rocks are harder and the erosion is negligible. The plan has been adopted successfully to preserve waterfalls elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Two Causes of Mail Delays</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font6">NE fruitful cause of mail delays is where mail is addressed to a person who lives at the corner of tW<sup>T</sup>o or more streets. Sometimes as many as four postal routes meet at a street intersection and it takes time to find the proper carrier. Another difficulty arises where mail is addressed to a large office or apartment building; and not infrequently there are two, three or more persons of the same name among the thousands of tenants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">T LEAST three railroads, the Pennsylvania, the Boston and Maine, and the Great Northern, have adopted the policy of buying bus and truck lines as feeders. The Pennsylvania is said to have at least a thousand miles of truck lines hauling local freight. In addition, at certain railroad termini, the package freight is now exchanged by trucks, the railroads having found it cheaper to do this than to move the cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Boy Rangers of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE Boy Rangers of America is a new organization, intended for boys from eight to twelve years of age. It is intended as an auxiliary for the Boy Scouts. It is said that there are already 10,000 Boy Rangers in the country, with lodges in forty-two states, and identified with some fifteen denominational groups. Boys from one to eight years of age and those still on the bottle have not yet been organized into any group of prospective fighters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Report on the Oil Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE American Petroleum Institute has issued a three-hundred-page report on the oil supply in which conclusions are reached that there is no imminent danger of the exhaustion of petroleum reserves in America, because of better methods of reaching the deeper deposits, increased supplies from countries to the south, better methods of refining and the ultimate use of almost unlimited oil shales, coal and lignites from which oil may be extracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bats as Mosquito Destroyers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE mosquito is one of the worst enemies of man. The bat is the deadly foe of the mosquito. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Manufacturers' Record</span><span class="font6"> reports that Dr. Charles A. R. Campbell of San Antonio, Texas, has devised a scientific bat-roost which is automatically adopted by bats as a permanent home and is self-sustaining, as one roost filled with bats will create annually four hundred dollars worth of guano. The suggestion is made that the installation of these bat-roosts twenty or thirty miles apart in any mosquito-infested country means the end of the mosquitos. On account of wet weather mosquitos have been unusually pestiferous in New Jersey and about New York City this past season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TV </span><span class="font6">ONDERFULLY important discoveries </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">V » </span><span class="font6">now being made in plant life. In Virginia it is so certain that cedar trees harbor and develop natural enemies of the apple that the law requires the destruction of all cedars within two miles of any apple orchard. On the same principle the barberry is an enemy in wheat lands, the black currant in white pine regions, and the common rosebush in potato belts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New York’s Water Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font6">EW YORK’S water supply comes from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ashokan reservoir, located in the Catskill mountains, six hundred feet above sea level, on the opposite side of the Hudson river. The water comes to New York through circular tunnels fifteen feet in diameter, and is delivered into the mains from as far as 750 feet below the street surface in some sections of the city. The water is excellent, always clear and always cool. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wild Life Reservation in Mississippi Valley</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE government is now taking steps to create in the upper part of the Mississippi valley, between Wisconsin and Minnesota, a reservation for wild birds and wild animals which will be about three hundred miles long and in some places five miles wide. The bluffs of the Mississippi throughout this district rise precipitously for hundreds of feet. The .district between these bluffs is often overflowed and, while useless for farming purposes, is ideal as a resort for game. Hunting and fishing will be allowed under regulations.</span></p>

But in Europe it is worse; for hundreds of thousands of Greeks were expelled from Asiatic territory in which their ancestors lived 1000 B. C. Similar movements have taken place in a dozen countries, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Esr thonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Hungary, Rumania, Albania, Czechoslovakia.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By W. E. Brokaw,</span><span class="font6"> Editor </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Eqwitist</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE statement in the The Golden Age, issue of July 1, page 613, about street-cars in Phoenix, Ariz., having been adandoned for bus lines is not quite accurate. At the City Manager’s office I was told that the street-car company is to cease operating the 15th of October, but that it is not yet known just what will be done after that. A variety of schemes have been suggested and are being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two Pictures </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE first picture is of a poor woman scrub-bing the hallway of a great modern office building. For this service, which is a great task for her, she is paid one dollar and fifty cents |jer evening. She has three children whom she is trying to keep in school long enough to be of some help. Her husband is a hopeless invalid and cannot even feed himself. Let us look at her. She has large beautiful eyes, but they are encircled with dark rings; her complexion is sallow and she looks weary beyond description. She is stooped and her small hands but infirmly hold the mop as she swings it back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ‘‘boss” of the building appears; he has a perpetual leer. He stops and tells the woman that she had better do a little better job or else her job will be given to another. He adds that there are plenty more who want work and there will be no trouble to get them. Now she enters one of the offices where there is a great amount of work to do. Everything is helter-skelter and she must rid up. This job has but recently been added to her regular round of duties in addition to her work in the hall, with no increase in pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With a deep sigh, now that her “boss” has gone, she enters in upon the task. Just a little care on the part of the occupant of the office would have greatly lessened the woman’s work. But he has been sitting there, feet higher than his head, all day long, making money by his wits and tossing things right and left as he smoked the best cigars. The woman’s lips are set firm; they do not move; but in her heart is the question : “O Lord, how long?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second picture is at the home of the wife of the man who lolls so comfortably in his office, tossing things right and left as he so comfortably counts up his easily made money. She is giving an afternoon tea during which will be a rendition of musical selections and readings. This lady is a specialist in giving cute child recitations, although she weighs nearly two* hundred pounds and is unbecomingly fat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The guests now begin to arrive and a colored maid takes charge of the wraps. They are of the best there is, many of them costing thousands of dollars. The program begins. Silly little songs are sung by women with mediocre voices, and soon they become the recipients of many false compliments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the hostess rises. She is going to “do” one of those child recitations. She gently' swings her two-hundred-pound frame into the middle of the floor amid tremendous applause and a wild flutter of excitement. Someone says, “Oh, she does those little things so dear.” Now she begins and she smirks and sways from side to side shyly and says, “I know where the violets grow,” etc., in a lisping, childish voice. The roof almost comes down with applause after she finishes. You know her favor is worth having; for she is a great lady, financially speaking, and that is all that counts now-a-days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I know that some who read this •wall say: “Just some wretched. bolshevik, who always wants to change everything, has written this.” Someone else will say that it is a mean picture of conditions that do not exist and was only written to stir up bitterness. But is it a false picture ? I do not think so. These same befurred women will go to church and sing: “He rules the world with truth and grace,” according to a certain hymn much in use. I wonder whether they ever compare conditions that now exist in the world with such a statement about God, and if so whether they do not come to doubt the accuracy of that statement. Thy kingdom come |</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">He is one of many explorers who are penetrating the still untrodden places of the earth in search of the secrets of cities and civilizations which will throw new light on the history of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The discovery last year by Oapt.

<p><span class="font4">There are still in the Antarctic five million square miles of untraversed land; the Kola peninsula, in Arctic Lapland, awaits the pioneer, and there are two million square miles of South America which may yield priceless discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the heart of China there has been found a race of blonde 'women with yellow curly hair, descendants of a people whose very name lias been lost; while in the Becker-Nihon islands </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the Hawaiian group, among the ruins of an unknown city built in stately terraces, there has been found a colony whose men are Apollos and whose women are of extraordinary beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Isthmus of Panama, beyond the Darien mountains, Mr. Mitchell-Hedges found a mysterious race of Indians with pure Mongolian features, living among ■prehistoric animals. In the same region was found a race of white Indians settled among the ruins of a great citv which flourished 5,000 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ A race of white savages has been found in the Vnyam-. wezi country, in tha heart of Africa, while in the hills to the north of the Mekliong valley, in Indo-China, is a silent tribe, which has no deity, worships no idols and has a language which consists only of five simple sounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Panama jungle travelers have found the perfectly preserved mummy of a girl whose hands and feet bore claws like those of some weird bird. These and ether relics point to the existence in that region in past ages of a race of human tree-dwellers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HE above confirms the prophecy concerning the new age we are entering, that all the secret things would be brought to light. “There is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest,” are the words of Jesus on this point. And in the light of such discoveries as the above, we see that this applies just as truly to the buried cities of the past as to the moral conduct of men and nations. Those who think the earth is in danger of becoming overcrowded now or in the Millennium can soon allay their fears by considering the fourth paragraph of this editorial, which declares that there are “five million square miles of untraversed land” in the Antarctic, and two million in South America as yet unexplored, besides the Kola peninsula, which still await the ax, pick' and shovel of the pioneer. And. if all the people who ever lived on the planet could find plenty of “standing room” in the Lone Star State, even on the basis of a very liberal estimate, allowing more generations to a century than the known average, most’ assuredly the contention of such is proven groundless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, we can befuddle our intellects with false reasoning and by juggling statistics, and still be unable to comprehend the truth with reference to this subject; but sanity and plain, ordinary “horse sense” will impel us to accept gladly such an easily demonstrable fact. Many who cannot see the mountain peaks of truth, towering before them in all their simple grandeur, have no difficulty in seeing (?) with great clearness of vision the mole-hills of superstition, creedal ignorance, and “science, falsely so-called”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The feel can readily understand and will quickly acknowledge that the crudest mechanical contrivance possible of production had a maker, that it was designed by somebody capable of thought and possessed of intelligence, but the poor thing is silenced -when the marvelous mechanism of the Universe, with literally billions of complicated and delicately balanced and adjusted parts, looms up before him in all its appalling magnificence I And in reply to the query, Has it a Maker, a Designer? he shakes las head, or says: “I do not know”I</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HE “blonde women of China”, the “stately terraces” of the “unknown city”, and the “Apollo-like men and women ... of extraordinary beauty” found among its ruins, referred to in the fifth paragraph, all belie the Darwinian hypothesis of an evolutionary origin of mankind. “The mysterious race of Indians with pure Mongolian features, living among prehistoric animals,” and the “race of white Indians” found in the Isthmus of Panama, living among the ruins of an ancient city, and the “white savages” of the Unyamwezi, all bear testimony to the falsity of Darwinism. The mummified freak' with claws “like those of some weird bird” confirms the Bible utterances concerning the fall of man and his tendency to become more brutelike and to gravitate to the level of the lower animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ Possibly Satan has to do with the production of freakish deviations from the normal human form and appearance, for the purpose of deluding humanity into believing and accepting his “Gospel of Dirt”, as Carlyle termed the evolution theory. King Nebuchadnezzar’s degradation to the level of a beast of the field, also confirms the foregoing, and shows us that humanity’s tendency is downward, and not upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We may be sure that when the kingdom of truth and righteousness is established in the world under Christ (Matthew 6:10; Daniel 7: 27), and Satan is bound for a thousand years, then the trend of the human race will be upward.—Acts 3:19-21; Isaiah 35:8-10.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Drastic Economy, A Hindrance to Progress </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">h. r.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Hewitt</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">T PRESENT a well-organized plea for systematic economy seems to be prevalent in all countries, especially in the'United States. At first glance and without due consideration, it would appear that this policy is the only door of relief or hope remaining to mankind for the settlement of the distressing problems of the civilized nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6"> fact worthy of our notice before we proceed further is that the most ardent advocators of economy in our fair land do not offer to reduce their salaries in the least. From the Chief Executive, Congress and the House of Representatives down to those who draw up the economy charts for the already struggling masses, all remain quite content to pocket what seems to the man of the street salaries far in excess of the service rendered. No doubt these advisers would plead the cost of maintaining appearances ; but why should millions toil for a mere pittance in constant dread of penury to uphold a system of veneered barbarism and exploitation and its great outward show?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor do we find the financiers and business men who so strenuously uphold and defend the economy theory relinquishing any of their so-called “God-ordained rights” as an example. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ah</span><span class="font6">. no! As usual, budgets will be prepared showing the already trodden-down laborer how/ to save twenty cents a day out of the $2.00 he receives; and, as ever, the advisers will give great and costly banquets, send their wives and daughters to seaside resorts in palatial steam yachts, and squander millions on the wheels of fortune in foreign lands or on the ever shifting and deceptive stocks and bonds of Wall Streets all over the land.' And following the regular, fi</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">rml</span><span class="font6">y entrenched custom, millions will be expended to hold huge naval maneuvers in far-off isles, while the sons of the soil ask for relief and get only a few begrudged crumbs of favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cannot every thinking man see that a policy of economy will halt development, commerce, invention, education, and human progress? And can they not discern that economy also means inefficient service, accidents, and underpaid, uneducated human labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What we need is not to cut the wages of the plumber, the carpenter, the bricklayer, and the railway man and to begrudge them the few comforts they get out of life, but to bring even the most underpaid trades up to and above that level without placing a skyrocket under the prices of the needs and necessities of life. And, by the way, let us not forget that though these trades average $5.00 to $12.00 a day they average only seven @r eight months’ work per year and hence, cannot amass the huge fortunes which many would have us believe they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Possibilities Within Reach</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font6">NLY a false standard of government would economize on development, human necessity, as well as human progress. Let us consider a few things which, if they were developed, would feed, warm, and supply comforts to the now longing masses often stinted of life’s necessities by a system of frugality where consideration of man’s need and comfort are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First of all there is the great Colorado river, from which could be developed power, heat, and light to ease the burdens of and give comforts to many. And not only these, but also millions of acres of dry, fertile, desert sands could receive the life-giving waters and as a result provide luxuriant abundance of grains, fruits, vegetables, etc., as well as a place where thousands of the dwellers in our overcrowded, reeking slums could establish comfortable, delightful homes in the midst of plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second, let ns cast our glance to those great undeveloped areas of natural resources adjacent to our highways of travel and the still greater areas where only a few brave explorers and pioneers have gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A little farther off we perceive Alaska, lying 'dormant with its millions and millions in undeveloped mineral, coal, and petroleum wealth, and with its broad, extensive tundras on which huge herds of reindeer and musk-ox could be raised by the millions for meat, hides and even dairy products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then skip to the undeveloped, unexplored, fertile tropical isles of the Pacific on which so little human care and effort is now expended, yet which, if efficiently subdued and cultivated, could produce shiploads of delicacies for many hungering palates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next consider what great good would result to commerce if a few of the millions so freely spent on war were diverted to the purpose of cutting through the St. Lawrence river-bed so as to permit Atlantic ocean-liners to come up to Detroit, Chicago, and Duluth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Direct your mind now to.the Avoeful lack of good roads in this enlightened land, which could easily be remedied by the unselfish use for the good of our neighbors of the abundant natural resources, efficient labor-saving machinery, and the man-power now lying idle in our cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then a great reforestation progTam is necessary to restore that which greedy corporations and individuals have like vandals stripped with little thought for the men of tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As with our forests, so with the fish and the game have the civilized vandals wreaked their destruction wholesale. It is true that our government has put forth some noble efforts to check the ruthless waste and restore that which those of the past so wantonly destroyed, yet how much greater should be the effort expended </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inventors and the greatest benefactors to our race must starve and shiver their uphill way to a pauper’s grave, in many cases, while others reap the millions resulting from the child of their brain. Must we economize at one end of the scale alone while checking creative invention and effort as a result of a policy of thrift ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Advantages of Aircraft Expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HEN there is that great field of commercial aircraft to expand. How easy it would be in time of flood, famine, pestilence, or other distress to rush airplanes to the scenes with the needed food, medicines, and relief! But, no I Christians (?) are too much occupied in making the world safe for democracy with poison gas, disease and blight bombs, liquid fire, etc., to do anything so useful and Christlike I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Education: How broad are the opportunities not to scrimp and save, but to expend more on constructive, technical education to fit our younger generation to meet skilfully and efficiently the demands of life! Shame on the nation that would take liberty and enlightenment as its motto, and then report through its census millions of illiterate or semi-educated citizens! Let us utilize our now deadly ships of war to take our youth to other lands on educational tours and thus bring men into a closer union and, as a result, deal narrow, cramped patriotism </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">death blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is folly to curse our bountiful Creator when a famine occurs, while there are millions of acres in the Amazon Valley, the jungle, and on the Nile that could be conquered and made to produce abundance for all if efficiently distributed. The plague-infested swamps from which rise hordes of disease-carrying pests—why not let science eliminate both the swamps and the insects, as was proved to be practicable in Panama and many other places?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Space will not permit more than a brief review of a few of the countless tasks which humanity could profitably make into useful agents for man’s common welfare. There are huge irrigation projects, such as that of the Sahara desert by artesian wells; the cutting of many canals to connect useful waterways; radio programs from powerful stations in an international language; the gathering of power from the winds, the tides, the rivers, and even from the subterranean heat of volcanoes; the planting and efficient cultivation of millions of acres of now idle lands; the education of the peons, slaves, both the literal and the wage variety, and the masses of foreign lands as well as the uneducated of our own domain; and lastly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">most-needed reform, the replacing of the disease breeding slum tenements with pretty stucco cottages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Just Distribution Would Bring Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HESE are not Utopian dreams, but the practicabilities of today, although we fully realize that until the full establishment of Christ’s kingdom the selfishness in all classes of men will prevent much of this being done, if not all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let no one hastily cry: “But if these things were developed ihere would be overabundance!” Ah, no! there might be under the present selfish, brutal law of “supply and demand”, but under a just system of distribution humanity’s needs would use up many times what is now produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rather we would not see men and women with pinched, starved, longing faces gazing wistfully at the things which, behind plate-glass windows, their undernourished stomachs so pitifully crave; nor would men long for the juicy steaks so temptingly displayed while knowing that their portion is a soup-bone. And then, there are the neat though not extravagant clothes which so many would like to have in place of patched, ragged overalls, etc. Nor would many shiver under thin rags while tons of coal and millions of unharnessed water-power go to waste, or lie dormant. Nor would men and women in the sweat-shops of our slums and cities long for a chance to till the . vacant fields and valleys, held by grabbing land-barons, while now even the sunlight rarely se ds its purifying rays upon their filthy conditions and surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ah! what vistas of comfort (and remember, comfort is far from the “fullness of bread” and vice of Sodom) we can vision; and these would not come as a result of thrift or economy but from free, open-handed, intelligent development of nature’s abundant resources, which when produced would not be wastefully left to rot on the fields as at present, but efficiently distributed where most needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hear of the “overabundance” in California. What a mockery, when one sees hundreds and hundreds in its large cities standing in line for a sandwich only! And then think of the multitudes that are too proud to ask for relief but grub along on the very verge of starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How far away relief seems to the despairing masses led from one false hope to another by their unfaithful leaders who are in the pay of the oppressor! But lift up your heads and rejoice, ye sorrowing of earth; for the time of deliverance is at hand, and just beyond the storm now hovering overhead, lie far greater glories than we can now conceive or imagine, under the righteous rule of Him who has promised to “break in pieces the oppressor” and to bring back to the misled masses their long usurped rights. Rejoice; for the time is at hand!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark38"></a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Dances </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6"> SEE by the papers that certain natives of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Africa were not pleased because they were not allowed to dance till they died, to give pleasure to the Prince of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They have similar customs among the Mexican Indians. I witnessed such a dance in 1906, in Zacatecas. I went with Mexican friends, a three days’ journey, in a coach of six horses, through great cactus forests and through the Rio Grande, out to a fine sheep ranch, or “hacienda”, in the wildest place . imaginable. Here we saw a large snake basking in the sunshine, and went out of the Avay to avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We then went to a small Indian village to see the natives celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross. The procession was ready to start when we arrived. Four Indians carried a large cross on their shoulders. Behind them four women carried a smaller one. Both crosses were decorated with large white flowers made from the interior white leaves of the maguey or century plant. As the procession started, the dance be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Elisabeth D. Whyte</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fore the cross began. The dancers were young, some very good-looking. They jumped up and down, whirled around, then for a time the step was 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An old man with a mask and long white beard, whom they called “El Perro” (the dog), carried a whip with which he kept the dancers in line. In the rear several wealthy Mexican “haciendados” (ranchers) danced. They were on horseback. Such beautiful animals! The costumes of the men and the trappings of the horses were heavily decorated with silver. They danced a sort of quadrille, slowly moving gracefully in and out, yet keeping pace with the procession, along the banks of the river. They halted a moment to pass the crosses on to others, and then the same performance continued until Ave returned to the Plaza, where many sought the privilege of carrying the heavy cross up the church steps, on their knees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the middle of the Plaza there was a high pole holding up a large globe, from which streamed many bright colored ribbons. The dancers each took hold of one and at a given signal they all started together like living shuttles, and they wove a beautiful design all over the globe; then, reversing the movement, they undid it, releasing a flight of snow-white pigeons that fluttered over our heads and settled on the roof of the- church. While the dancers were weaving the globe they kept perfect time to the music and the dance steins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was wonderful; yet those poor natives were' half savages, in spite of the church in their; midst, and were willing to dance till they' dropped. If they were willing to suffer for their eternal torment god, how much more so they will be when they know that God is not a monster, but a God cf wisdom, justice, love and power! The feast was over for us, but the fanatical natives kept on dancing until they were exhausted, and many died.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Adrenal Glands—Humaii Chemical Laboratory </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph Greig</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HY does the hair on a cat’s back, and the hair on a human head, go straight up, and 'the-flesh turn “goosey<sup>5</sup>in the presence of fear? Scientists tell us that two little glands the size of a walnut, and located just above the kidneys, are responsible for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These glands, known as the adrenal glands, ■shoot forth a chemical into the blood stream which prepares the system for instant combat with outside foes. Adrenalin is the name of the chemical which these glands discharge, and which immediately changes the size of the blood vessels. These glands also affect the liver, whoso function is to store up sugar for instant use in an emergency and at the moment of the chemical discharge the liver pours out at once sufficient of its store to meet the necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another precaution which the human organism involuntarily takes during times of stress is the instant diminishing of the size of the arteries leading to the stomach, while ‘those leading to the lungs, heart, brain and nerve centers become temporarily larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the above facts and certain other blood tests, present-day super (?) education is seeking to identify reasoning man with the lower orders of animals, which are governed by instinct. While the organic principle in man and in lower animals may be similar in many respects, who would dare to assert that reason by a process of logic and deduction is to be found in any other animal than man? Moreover, those of the protoplasmic evolutionary theory, are bare of all hope as respects a future life, whereas the Bible inspires the mind with a resurrection prospect for man, built on a basis of absolute justice through the legal transaction of the cross of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, while these sticklers for godliness in creation swallow their monkey and camel, Holy Writ clears our vision completely by saying that man was made a little lower than the angels, and crowned with glory and honor, and given dominion over the works of God’s hands. Thus the human king fell as per the Genesis record and blurred the image of his Maker to the extent that man does not now wish to retain Jehovah in his knowledge. The average of life has greatly shortened since the Flood also, and at present, is about thirty-five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is apparent that this adrenalin chemical secretion in nature was simply arranged by an All-wise Creator to increase the blood flow in times of distress and has no special bearing upon the matter of instinct. In fact anger and all the human impulses have not only a direct connection with the character status of the person but materially affect the health and physical structure of the organism, even beyond whrl is discernible by the senses.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Youth and the (Modern)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">E CULL the following remarkable declaration from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Life of Youth,</span><span class="font6"> which is a monthly magazine published in Zurich, Switzerland. It shows how even amidst the ranks of Christian youth opposition to the old order is developing, which, together with many other</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">State </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By F. Leon Scheerer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">factors, is working towards its certain dissolution, and breaking ground for a new and better order of things. The article purports to set forth the attitude of the rising Swiss generation in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We reject the modem state in its threefold aspect, • We disown its claim of being Judicatory. While at one time perhaps the sponsor of uplift and progress, it has, like its legal code, become hardened and the most bitter opponent of every innovation born in its time that tends towards a possible change of established forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We deny to the state a rightful claim to public morality. We claim it to be the resultant of the public’s expression of morality and not an expression of the existing state itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J We reject it as an organizer of communal life. As protector of the class struggle it stigmatizes its egoistic interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This worldly partisan spirit finds expression in the sanctified competitive system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We renounce state feudalism and base our hope in the community rooted in the Gospels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">L; And we finally reject it as a state of coercion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P We are compelled to reject the state, because its very Constructive principle is that of force. To might or force of any kind, we deny the claims of morality and : moral worth. To the spirit of our youth the thought 5 of force and of every institution based upon it, is irreConcilable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The history of the past ten years has robbed us of our last shred of confidence in the modern state. We have seen modern political economy before our very eyes, develop into class rule internally and into nationalism externally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We direct all our energy against both; for they will culminate in a joint use of the military against the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">foe within and for war against the national enemy without. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The modern state pursues the ideal of material support and spiritual development of its citizenry. But since it actually fails even in this respect, it is our prerogative to challenge it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The point at issue is not the continuity and maintenance of the state so much as the welfare of the people <sub>t </sub>and opportunities for an unhampered expansion and ’ intellectual development of their character. But whatever obstructs such moral development must be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are made to feel that the state as now organized is blocking the path of God’s incoming kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For this reason we challenge the modern state. We challenge it, even though knowing, yea because of this very knowledge, that youth is recognized by the modem state. This has a double significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We love our country. But we are not misled in our love by the patriotic huzzas of Swiss carnivalists of the type, “From a distance far, we greet thee,” nor by the distress of our people, daily crying their needs more loudly to heaven, nor yet by the preparedness frenzy of our militarists and their followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our love for our country and people is deeply rooted in our hearts, but above our native country and people towers God’s coming kingdom. Strong peoples are needed for its support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Brave men who work while others sleep, Who dare while others fly—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They build a nation’s pillars deep And rear them to the sky.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Youth is the Symbol of Palestine</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">U</span><span class="font6">NDER the above title the Jewish National Fund Bureau for America, 114 Fifth Ave., New York, publishes a little pamphlet which Contains much that is heart-cheering for a Bible student. The little booklet opens with a suggestive poem by Rudyard Kipling, which we republish herewith, together with the first page of the booklet: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am the land of their fathers, In me the virtue stays,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I will bring back my children After certain days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under their feet in the grasses My clinging magic runs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They shall return as strangers, They shall remain as sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">■—Rudyard Kipling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tthe Jewish people is the oldest of the nations; Palestine counts among the earliest lands of civilization. Yet from the reunion of the Jewish people and Palestine has sprung the miracle of a vigorous new youth for both. For the waste places of Palestine are being transformed into fertile fields and luxuriant plantations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The moribund classic Hebrew has become the living virile national tongue proudly spoken by old and young, and recognized as an official language by the government of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sons and daughters of the Jewish people have become pioneers in Palestine, consecrating their youth to the regeneration of the Jewish Homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer youth of Palestine, better known by their Hebrew name of Haiuzim, have come in thousands from Germany, Austria, Poland, Russia, Hungary and Ozecho-Slovakia since the end of the World War. Most of them are members of well-to-do Jewish families, and have abandoned comfortable homes, university studies and professional careers for the sake of their Zionist ideals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">:<sup>f</sup> The ideals of the pioneers are declared to be identical with the promises given through the ancient prophets; plain living, high thinking; a return to the soil under such conditions that there shall be in all Palestine neither gentlemen farmers nor farm laborers; and the universal use of the Hebrew tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until now, it seems, the acquisition of land in Palestine has been bound up with many legal and social difficulties, and large tracts were not available under any circumstances. But now the situation is extremely favorable, and every Jew who can do so is being urged to contribute $20, which will recover for the Hebrews as a whole a dunam (% acre) of the ancient homeland. To our way of thinking there are blessings for everybody who can and will take an active part in this restoration of God’s typical people to the land promised to them as an everlasting inheritance. The little book closes with the following appeal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Some young men. and women, will go from America to share in the pioneering achievements of the Haluzim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But the majority will remain behind, even as a majority of the Jews remained behind when Ezra led a devoted band on the Return from Babylon. Then, those who did not give themselves, gave of their gold and silver. So must we do today. If we do not give our own selves, we must furnish the means for those who do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall we in America eat, drink and be merry while Palestine is yet to be redeemed ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall we let the pioneers hunger in vain for the soil of Palestine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall we leave the Jewish Homeland without land?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">MAZING claims as to speed and vertical rising are put forward on behalf of a monoplane of an entirely new type, the plans of which have just been brought to London by a young Austrian aeronautical engineer named Charles Gligorin. The Ministry has offered to build an experimental model on his specifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new monoplane is based on an application of the rotor principle used in the Plettner rotor ship. Among remarkable claims made for the machine are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It can rise almost vertically up from the ground, like a helicopter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Its speed is three times greater than the fastest plane of a similar size at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Economy would be effected up to thirty-three percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is nothing “freakish” about the appear-.ance of the new monoplane. It does not depend solely for its power on its rotor, which takes the place of wings. At the axis of the rotor is an ordinary 240 h. p. engine, driving a propeller on the ordinary principle. An average speed of something over 300 miles an hour is claimed, which would bring the American continent within twelve hours of Europe—a dream which would be further realized by its independence of landing fields. One of the problems facing the air traffic experts in the past, has been the loss of time taken in the transportation of passengers from the center of the cities to the outly--ing suburbs. Where it now takes over seven minutes to rise to a height of 1,000 feet, Mr. Gligorin claims that his machine will take only one and one-half minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He also claims that the machine possesses “safety” properties in respect to engine failure, which would materially minimize the risk of flying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Machinery for Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">l\/r Rakovsky, Soviet agent, who has re-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">■1V1.. </span><span class="font6">turned to London, has come prepared to place orders with British firms to the extent of no less than £15,000,000, says the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald.</span><span class="font6"> Of these some £10,000,000 will be for agricultural and other machinery required as the result of the good harvest that is said to be assured for Russia this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Motor Cars in Great Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HERE were 1,393,000 motor vehicles licensed in Great Britain on May 31, including </span><span class="font4">533,000 cars 518,000 cycles</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">217,000 trade vehicles</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">92,000 cabs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These figures are given in a return by ths Ministry of Transport, which also shows that in the period December 1, 1924, to May 31,1925, gross receipts for taxes on motor vehicles were £13,002,255.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Smoke jJvil</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font6">URING a London smoke fog a twelve-year-old child in twenty-four hours breathed 250 miles of smoke particles. Manchester’s smoke deposit exceeds London’s by a great deal. So said Mr. Fletcher Allen, the organizing secretary .of the British Humane Society, addressing Manchester Rotarians. The smoke, he said, practically denied children the right to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Century Ago and Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TpANCY Stephenson’s engine puffing along &gt;*• from Stockton to Darlington as it did a hundred years ago! True, the poor old centenarian with its comic funnel and queer mechanism, had a brand new petrol motor hidden in its “tummy”; grafted into it, so to speak, like a youth-renewing monkey gland—else it could not have made its brave show. Its smoke and steam were counterfeit, but for the rest it was the genuine ancestor of all the world’s locomotives. Imagine, then, the contrast between this venerable machine and the latest triumphs of steam engineering that have followed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The eye beholding the first and latest engine can see a hundred years of pregress in science and skill; but the imagination can hardly realize the tremendous consequences of this mechanical development. That first little tin-pot puffer started a change in human relationships and activities second only to the mental and social revolution caused by the invention of printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The English towns were on holiday recently, to watch a six miles procession of locomotives and rolling stock of every type, from the old '‘Puffing Billy” and dandy coach to the latest high-speed mammoth and its luxurious carriages (coaches) and dining saloons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Railway Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">N HIS presidential address to the National Union of Railwaymen’s Annual Conference at Southport, Mr. W. Dobbie said that they met in the shadow of great industrial depression, and that the workers were faced with the greatest crisis this generation-had known. As with other industries, so with the railway industry. Whenever employers want to curtail expenses it is always the workers who are called upon to bear the brunt of the burden. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are always called upon to make sacrifices in the national interests, but we know from bitter experience that the life of a workman and his family is one of continual sacrifice; and I say definitely that the time has arrived when sacrifices must be made by the other class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So long as there is the desire on the part ef the railway companies to enforce reductions on our members, go long as men are being dismissed 'and throws on the streets, so long as there is a shopman on short time, there can be no justification for railway shareholders receiving seven and a half percent, five percent, or even two and a half percent quarterly dividends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Continuing, Mr. Dobbie said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have given careful consideration to the whole problem with which we are faced, and I can see no reason why our members should sacrifice one iota more-of the conditions we have succeeded in obtaining. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Iji</span><span class="font4"> my opinion the depression through which the trade of this country is passing does not justify the further lowering of our standard of existence. The statements of the railway companies are a confession of their failure to run. the industry efficiently, and the time has arrived when the industry should be taken over by the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mining Situation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The subcommittee of the Miners’ Federation have worked out plans for an alliance with railwaymen, transport workers, and engineers. These unions have a membership of 3,000,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Miners’ Viewpoint</span><span class="font6"> 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpi-IE miners claim that the owners are to blame for the condition of the industry, because they have never taken the miners into their confidence as provided in Part Two of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, Continuing, Mr. Smith said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whether the country believes in nationalization or not, it will be driven to adopt that as the only possible solution to save the mining industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Yorkshire a resolution was recently passed by the miners condemning wars, declaring that the workers were used as pawns in the game, and calling on the Miners’ Federation to give a mandate to the Miners’ International to declare a strike in the mines of the whole world in the event of a situation arising whereby any of the nations might become involved in war. At the time of writing both owners and miners are looking to the government to take action over this resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Mammoth Engineering Feat</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">B</span><span class="font6">Y BRINGING the waters of Loch Treig, which lies 16 miles inland and 700 feet above sea-level, down to Loch Linnhe for driving a plant which will supply 100,000 horsepower for refining aluminum-bearing earth, which corresponds in magnitude, for technical reasons, to a 300,000 horse-power station providing electricity to a municipality for lighting, etc., there will be made in the heart of the Western Highlands of Scotland sufficient electricity to supply the wants of three cities the size of Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking to a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Post</span><span class="font6"> representative, Mr. Halcrow, the engineer responsible for the designing of the scheme, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You can say that it will be the biggest engineering feat attempted in Britain since the Forth Bridge was built. You may also say that the tunnel, when complete, will be the longest in Europe, and will be surpassed in the entire world only by the Shandaken Tunnel in the Rocky Mountains, which, incidentally, is only half the diameter of the proposed Lochaber Tunnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Already the main task is being attacked in bringing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the waters of Loch Treig down </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to i£a fefioTSS o? </span><span class="font4">Loci Linnhe—Ben Nevis lies right in the way—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">job </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font4">quiring the faith that moves mountains. But engineer! do not rely on faith very much; we put our trust iat tunnels instead. Actually the results will be the sama, Ben Nevis will be eliminated, and through its granitai heart will rush a river of water packed with a tremens dous force into a concrete-lined cylindrical tube, fifteen miles long and about sixteen feet in diameter; about half as high again as a London “Tube”, which no one considers small. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a railway twenty-two miles long to be made, already working at three points, and to be finished in October. Camps have to be built—twelve altogether— for the housing of workmen. The largest of these will be on ths bare hillside near Spean Bridge, and will contain canteens, recreation-rooms, and playing fields. In one of the wildest and most barren regions in the whole British Isles these signs of industrial progress must be created before the first drill can bite into the virgin rock of the mountain; and every ounce of material must be brought there somehow. A temporary power-scheme must be created on the River Spean to furnish electricity for running the drills. This alone will require thirty miles of transmission apparatus, steel masts, wires, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present the work occupies 1000 workmen, and when in full swing 2500 will be employed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">for 5,000 peony blooms arrived in Glasgow a short time ago, on the Canadian Pacific liner Montreal, enroute to the exposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The London Midland and Scottish Railway had special refrigerator cars in waiting to convey the blooms to Wembley. On a day arranged the blooms were distributed to all the women who called at the C. P. R. Pavilion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bulk of these blossoms were cut from plants grown by Mr. W. Ormiston Roy, the well-known Montreal landscape gardener. In order that everything mighi? be done to keep the blooms in proper condition, his brother, Mr. John F. Roy, came over with them on the steamer. It is believed that this is the first time that cut flowers have been sent across the ocean on so considerable a scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Say not the struggle nought availeth, The labor and the wounds are vain, The enemy fainteth not nor faileth, And as things were, they still remain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">But westward look; the land is bright!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The Periodic Coal Strike</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ECAUSE </span><span class="font6">they will not invest a few dollars three or four months ahead of time for the coal which the’ must have later, the common people of the north and the east do all humanly possible to encourage the oft-recurring coal strikes which boost their prices skyward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">April is the best time to buy coal, because the prices are then the lowest. The prices thereafter raise about 25 cents per ton per month. July and August are good months in which to buy because the mines are running light, the coal is dry and well cleaned, and the deterioration from then to time of use is nil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The so-called coal strikes are usually little more than a tacit agreement between miners and operators to work off accumulated coal stocks at a high price and thereafter for both to get a slice of increased profits; for the coal once boosted in price, because of a strike, never comes down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By waiting till the late fall or winter rush, the consumer gets a full quota of slate, bony, culm or any other fancy name you wish to call </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it. </span><span class="font6">Also, there is usually a generous quantity of plain dirt. And by waiting until snow falls ths consumer also has a chance to pay for a quan-&gt; tity of ice and snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a coal strike does come, the first people looked after are the Canadians, partly as ah act of mercy and partly because the railroad haul is longer, and the railroads like to get the benefit of the long hauls. By waiting until bad weather comes, coal consumers are subject to delays due to slow movements of cars and ferries; and not infrequently the railroads are then congested with the movements of crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the consumers would keep their bins filled up with coal at all times it would be best for them and best for the miners. Work would be steady for the miners, stocks would not accumulate which would have to be moved by resorting to the “strike” method, and prices to the consumers would be lower and steadier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is nonsense to talk about federal control of anthracite mines. The anthracite mines can be worked only by trained anthracite workers, and no human power can compel them to work unless they wish to do so.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark47"></a>What is Evolution? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Leonard Tucker</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">N APPRO ACHING a discussion of man’s creation we find it necessary to dispose of evolution as an antagonist. Popular evolution, or modernism, is to the effect that all living matter has evolved from “one living filament”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6">far as I have read, all writers of the Darwinian school acknowledge the antagonism between the creative and evolutionary theories. A writer of the article on evolution in the “Encyclopedia Britannica” has this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is clear that the doctrine of evolution is directly antagonistic to that of creation. . . . The question how far the doctrine of evolution, in its most extended and elaborate form, absolutely excludes the idea of creatlr# activity need not be dwelt on here. It is sufficient </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">say that the theory of evolution, by assuming an intelligible and adequate principle of change, simply eliminates the notion of creation from those regions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of exis</span><span class="font4">tence to which it is applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This much furnishes sufficient proof that the evolutionary proposition cannot be debated intelligently until its proponents agree upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">definition of terms, or tell us plainly what they mean by the term “evolution”. Thus defined we can know whether or not evolution is antagonistic to creation. I think we are entitled to a definition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">But a smile somehow had replaced the frown. It puzzled me much; and so, one day, I seized his hand in a friendly way, And said: “Mr. Horner, I’d like to know What can have happened to change you so?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He laughed a laugh that was good to hear; For it told of conscience calm and clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And he said, with none of the old-time drawl: “Why, I’ve changed my residence, that is all.” “Changed your residence?” “Yes,” said Horner, “It wasn’t healthy on Grumble Corner, And So I moved; ’twas a change complete;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And you’ll find me now on Thanksgiving Street.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Significance of the Mass </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By c. s. Yarwood </span><span class="font6">(Reprinted from an old magazine)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TT WAS a Saturday afternoon in the autumn 4- of 1904, that I entered the Roman Cathedral at Westminister. For some time previous I had been revolving in thought a crucial question. A suspicion had arisen in my mind relative to the real meaning and significance, the true inwardness of that central rite and institution of Romanism—the Mass. I had resolved to bring the question to an issue whenever I might find myself in contact with any authorized exponent of the doctrine of transubstantiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On entering the Cathedral, almost the first person I observed was a Romish priest in cassock and biretta, presumably one in residence; he entered the church from a side-door, and made his way with quids step up through the length of the nave towards the other end of the building. With an instinctive feeling that my opportunity had come, I immediately followed. The priest made his way past the huge block of granite, a monolith of some twenty tons weight, destined for the high altar—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in situ,</span><span class="font6"> but not yet dedicated to its object—mounted a few steps to the stage behind, then turned round and stood to survey the vast space before him, which doubtless his imagination filled in the not distant future with a vision of pomp, of priests, and of people doing homage to the Roman Eucharist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I qui ckly made my way towards him, and in a moment or two was at his side. My first remark was of the immense building they had erected, to which he assented with, manifest satisfaction. &quot;And that,” I said, indicating the colossal block ©f granite just before us, “is, or will be, the high altar at which High Masses will be said.” “Yes,” he replied. I then said, “'Would you permit me to ask you one or two questions by way of inquiry?” He assented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I believe it is the teaching of your Church, that after the words of consecration uttered by the priest, the substance of the wafer bread undergoes an absolute change and becomes substantially the very body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. An invisible miracle takes place, so that under the outward forms of bread and wine it is Christ Himself who is present on your altars ?” “That is so,” he replied. “You do really and truly believe,” I continued, “that the very same Christ, who lived on this earth 1,800 years ago and died upon a cross on Calvary, is present in person on the altar after the wafer has undergone the process of consecration by a priest—that the priest really holds Christ Himself in his hands?” “Yes,” the priest answered. “We touch and handle Him, just as I am touching you,” he said, placing his hand at the same moment'upon my eoat-sleeve. “You mean to say,” I suggested, “that Christ is present, under the form of the wafer, as truly as my arm is under the sleeve of my coat.” “Yes,” he said. “Well,” I replied, “that is not my faith, but I am not wishing to discuss that matter now. Assuming, for the moment, it is as you affirm, and the dogma of transubstantiation to be true, the question I was wishing to ask you is this: When you have the Lord Jesus Christ upon your altars, and actually in your hands, then what do you do with Him? Do </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you profess to put Him to death?”</span><span class="font6"> His . answer was Wes.<sup>7</sup> <sup>rf</sup>You profess,” I insisted, &quot;to slay Him, to immolate and kill Jesus Christ upon your altars?” I confess a chill went through me as I proposed the question and listened for his reply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">He gave me the impression of being taken off his guard, or, rather, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rome has no guard at this vital point of her system,</span><span class="font6"> or he might have evaded my question. I had taken him on a high tide of feeling. Did not Rome’s colossal cathedral in which we stood, with the most magnificent pageants of her cult, stand upon and centre in the dogma of the Mass? Does not the very word by which the wafer is known after consecration, &quot;The Host,” from the Latin </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hostia— </span><span class="font6">a victim—signify one who has been immolated? Does not the term altar connote a victim offered in sacrifice; and what other victim suffers on Roman altars, according to Rome’s dogma, but Christ? But, again, does not the apostle also speak of those who &quot;crucify the Son of God afresh and put Him to an open shame” ? What does such language point at? And, says the same apostle, they do it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“to themselves”.</span><span class="font6"> (Heb. 6:6) They speak of “the Adorable Sacrament of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> altars”. They proclaim aloud to the world (to quote their own words) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“our</span><span class="font6"> unswerving belief in the central mystery of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> religion, the fact that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, ever offers Himself” (i. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e.,</span><span class="font6"> is offered by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> priests)—&quot;as a sacrifice upon the altar of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> churches, and unceasingly dwells in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font6"> tabernacles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He who died once for all, for the sins of the whole world, is thus put to death daily, if the 'dogma of transubstantiation will hold, in the interests of a sect, and for the sole benefit of its adherents, from which benefits all “non-Cath-olics”, so they teach (that is, six-sevenths of the human race) are excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us be thankful that St. Peter, who instrumentally opened the kingdom of heaven to all men, and St. Paul, whose commission was “to every creature . . . under heaven” (Col. 1:23), never preached a “gospel” so uncatholic, sectarian, and exclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest had entered upon the conversation evidently under the impression that my purpose was to argue the question of transubstantiation ; for to this he reverted. “We believe,” he went on to say, “that the sacrifice of the Mass is the very same sacrifice as that offered on Calvary ; that,” said he, indicating the huge block of cold gray stone, &quot;is our Calvary” “And you,” I said, “that is, the priests of your Church, put Christ to death there?” “Yes,” he said, but there was this time a tone of hesitation in his word. I replied: “Well, I felt that the doctrine of the Mass must involve that conclusion, but was not prepared to hear it openly avowed as you have done. You remember who they were who crucified Christ?” “The Jews,” he replied. “And the Romans,” I added. “Then the priests of your Church, who repeat in the Mass the very sacrifice of Calvary, are the successors of the Jews and the Romans.” At this point he seemed to lose assurance and began to flounder. “Oh,” said he, “the Jews were the instruments.” “And you,” I asked, “what are you?” “Oh, but we don’t put Him to death really. We haven’t His glorified body—that is in heaven. We do it as far as we can.” “You do it as far as you can; you would do more if you could?” I queried. “It is a representation, it is not a reality. Why not then tell the people this and say: Good people, this ceremony of the Mass is our way of representing the death of Jesus Christ upon the cross?” “No, no!” he exclaimed. “It is a reality. We believe that after transubstantiation Christ is really upon the altar under the outward forms or the species —as we say, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in propria persona” I</span><span class="font6"> said again: &quot;Whether the miracle of transubstantiation does or does not take place, is not just now my point. I know your dogma asserts Christ to be really there, ‘His flesh, bones, nerves, and divinity,’ under the forms of bread and wine, according to the catechism of the Council of Trent, from which their own substances have disappeared. My point, I repeat once mere, is when you have Christ thus upon your Calvary, what becomes of Him? What do you do with Him? Do you put Him to death?” Again the answer was “Yes!” “Then, I affirm, that upon your own showing, by your own words, your priests prove themselves the successors, not of the apostles, as they claim to be, but the successors and representatives of the Jews and Romans.” “No, it is a representation,” rejoined the priest. “You must forgive pie,” I replied, “if I say you seem in a fog about this subject, A thing cannot be at once merely a representation of a reality and the reality itself. Either it is a real sacrifice of Jesus Christ that you immolate on your altars, or it is no sacrifice at all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If you proless </span><span class="font6">to put 'Jesus Christ to death in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the sacrifice of </span><span class="font6">the Mass, you crucify Him afresh, and this declare yourselves the successors of thor.e whom St. Peter himself charged with the crime ‘of killing the Prince of Life’ (Acts 3:15), and St. Stephen branded as ‘His betrayers and murderers’. But,” I continued, * ‘Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, death hath do more dominion over Him’; therefore your dogma of a repeated sacrifice of Christ in the Mass is a false one.” By this time the priest had become very uncomfortable, and as I said the words: “Your position cannot stand, it must fall, and Rome with it,” he abruptly quitted me and hastily disappeared through a door at the back of the tribune.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Mass an Unholy Institution </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Charles w. Oxley.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O YOU </span><span class="font6">know that the custom of the Mass instituted and practised by the Papal system is a false, unseriptural one which, however sincere and honest the people may be in believing this doctrine, repudiates and sets aside the all-sufficient sacrifice which Jesus made in giving His perfect humanity as a sin-offering for His body, which is the church, applicable during the Gospel Age, and also for the life of the world in due time? (1 Timothy 2:5,6) Does not the Apostle John say that Jesus is the propitiation (satisfaction) for the church’s sins and also for the sins of the whole world? (1 John 2: 2,4,10) This being true, what Scriptural authority is there for legalizing the claim that another method must be instituted in order to the cancellation of sin, and has not the Papal system established this very method and doctrine in the institution of the Mass? Do they not claim that other sins are committed which must be atoned for in addition to and in conjunction ■with Christ’s sacrifice? Do they not therefore set aside and render desolate (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14) what the apostle declares is an all-sufficient sacrifice? Are they not in this respect adding to the Word of God (Revelation 22:18,19), which says that “all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works”? (2 Timothy 3:16,17) Have they not a false conception of this subject when other scriptures are given careful examination and consideration? Yea, verily; for the sacrifice which Jesus made of His perfect humanity is, as says the Prophet Daniel, the continual daily sacrifice (Daniel 12:11) and covers Adamic sins only, committed through ignorance, imperfection, inherited blemishes or unwittingly done, resultant from the fall of Adam in Eden, but does not cover wilful sins against light and truth, or in common parlance, in the face of knowing better, but every transgressor will receive a just recompense of reward. Christ did all, and His sacrifice covers every condition except wilful sin. That this is verified and attested in Scripture we have the Master’s own words as recorded by Luke 12:47, 48, which read: ‘He that knew to do my Father’s will and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes, but he that knew not to do my Father’s will and did it not, shall be beaten with few stripes,’ thus also indicating that punishment will be inflicted in proportion to the wilfulness of the sins committed. See also Ecclesiastes 11:9,10; Proverbs 11:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it not the will of God that men shall cease from committing sin when they know it is sin (Acts 17: 30) and since there is a plain, positive statement of the Master that if they sin wilfully and with impunity they shall receive stripes, do you think that G od could or would change His program to suit the behests of the institution of the Mass? (Malachi 3:6) For -would not such a procedure impart the lie to the Master’s words and would not God be changeable, whereas does not the apostle say that with God is no variableness nor shadow of turning’? (James 1:17) To request this wilfully, knowingly and consciously, do you think it is pleasing to God? (James 4:3) What true saint of God would desire or request Him to reverse or change His Word or plan? Is not every word of God pure? (Proverbs 30:5; John 17:17; Titus 1:15,16) The punishment, however, does not imply eternal torment nor literal purgatorial fires, as there are no such conditions, never were and never will be, as many scriptures attest when the symbols are correctly understood, in i addition to which'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Kotembbb</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 18, 1923 </span><span class="font6">are direct statements frustrating this doctrine. They will, however, receive punishment of some kind right here on the earth, if not now, then during Christ’s Millennial reign. (Proverbs 11: 31) The scourgings of that time, as stated foregoing, will be in proportion to the knowledge sinned against (Matthew 12: 36, 37) and it will also be a time for the rewarding of the good then done, as well as the punishment of evil doers and evil doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another manner in which the doctrine of the Mass conflicts with the Bible and is Seripturally shown to be infamous and illegal consists in the fact that the people are subjected to the payment of various sums or penances and for the celebration of the Mass, which is, in fact, considering other scriptures following, sowing to the wind only to reap the whirlwind. How can it be thought or said that God requires money from the penitent one when He already owns all the earth and the fulness thereof, with all the gold and the silver and the cattle upon a thousand hills? (Psalm 50:10-12; Haggai 2: 8) Does He not rather say: “Give me thine heart” ? (Proverbs 23: 26;<sub>;</sub> Joel 2:13; Acts 17: 25) And is it not an attempt to purchase salvation with corruptible things such as silver and gold when large fees are exacted for the celebration of the Mass, and is it not contrary to the Scriptures which say that in the time of free grace all may come and partake of the water of life freely without money and without price? (Isaiah 55: 1; Revelation 21:6; 22:17) And incidentally when the Lord says, “Give me thine heart,” does He say that you should give it to a priest of the Papal system or a preacher of the Protestant systems, or does He say that you shall give it to Him ?—Isaiah 8:13; Luke 12:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, the blinding influence of the Mass, were it condoned by the inspired record, God’s Word, rvould baffle the execution and effectiveness of other scriptures which declare that a harvest of deeds, whether good or evil, awaits every individual, regardless of creed or caste (Ecclesiastes 11:9; 12:13,14; Galatians 6:7), and in this respect it does not require the use of a microscope or the most powerful telescope to discern in the Mass the hand of its instigator—Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Have we not also the positive statement of the Scriptures that that which befalleth men be-</span><span class="font6">falleth beasts; one thing befalleth them, as th« one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast (under the present dying and death conditions)? (Ecclesiastes 3:19) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Have </span><span class="font6">we any authority for thinking that the beast has a soul which cannot die, and is thus consigned to eternal torture? And if nothing remains </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the beast after it dies, how can it be said that there is any life in man after he dies, since he dies as the beast? Do not all go to the one place; are not all of the dust; and do not all turn to the dust again?—Ecclesiastes 3:20.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">What justifiable grounds have we for interpreting the 21st vs. of Ecclesiastes as a guarantee that the life “wings its flight back to God”, as some have represented it? The spirit of life is not an intelligence, nor a person, but merely a power or privilege which has been forfeited, and hence reverts to the original giver of that power or privilege. The thought is that man, having sinned, has no further life-rights, that the return of his forfeited life-rights and the return of his flesh to dust reduce his condition to exactly what it was before he was created. Men will therefore have to seek elsewhere for their preeminence, and will this not be when they are called forth from the sleep of death (Matthew 5:18; 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6), when all who will obey will be given eternal life? (John 5:25; Acts 3:23) And will not all the willing and obedient then receive the benefits of Christ’s ransom sacrifice. (Matthew 22:32; 5: 28; Luke 9:59,60), and will this not be in glowing contrast to the destitute, unprofitable doctrine of the Mass ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the foregoing Scriptural statements, is not the doctrine of the Mass not only false and fictitious, but also useless and unnecessary ? And if one of the doctrines to which the people cling so tenaciously, as a vital one is Seripturally, and therefore legally wrong, does this not prove and portend that there is something radically wrong with the machinery and the whole system ? How can the celebration of the Mass benefit the dead when, as the Scrip-’ tures state, the dead know not anything; when there is neither wisdom, knowledge, nor device in the grave whither thou goest?—Ecclesiastes 3:20; 7:2; 9:5,10; Job 14:20; 34:15; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Psalms 6:5; 90:3; 104:29; 146:4; Genesis 3: 19; Isaiah 38:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">T IS conceded that different parts of the human brain perform separate functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Phrenologists have charted the human brain, naming the various faculties. Among these various organs of the brain is that which is called veneration. Each human being who has an average amount of normalcy possesses veneration in some degree. Veneration induces the creature to hold some being, creature or thing in high respect, leading to worship of that being, creature or thing. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word “god” is defined by lexicographers as “a being regarded as possessing superhuman or supernatural power, and to be propitiated by sacrifice and worship; a deity, idol or object of worship”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Man is born with a measure of veneration; and he finds himself instinctively looking to some thing or being in reverence, adoration and worship. Hence we see that it is natural for men to worship some thing or some being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ancient Egyptians worshiped crocodiles, calves and other living creatures. Other nations also worshiped some images of wood and some of stone. Many of these gods are found in the museums of the world. All the nations of earth at some time have worshiped idols of various kinds. Some worship the sun, and moon and ■ the stars. The ancient Greeks had many gods whom they rshiped. Likewise other nations have various -yds or objects of veneration and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In modern times many make gold their god; while others worship political power, which they call the state. This form of worship is often misnamed patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are but a few people on earth who worship the true and only living God. This failure to worship Jehovah is evidently due to the fact that most of the peoples of earth are ignorant of the true God. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the only true God. The Lord of hosts is another name that He has given Himself. When the great Jehovah God had safely delivered the people of Israel from the bondage of Egypt and led them to Mount Sinai in the desert, He there gave to them His law. It was then that He said unto Israel: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is ■in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.”—-Exodus 20:2-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many persons have become offended at these words found in the Bible. They have said that if they are to believe the Bible then it would mean that Jehovah has selfishly commanded that the people shall worship Him for His benefit; that if He is the true and only living God, then the people would instinctively worship </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him </span><span class="font6">without being commanded. Those who thus reason have proceeded upon the erroneous theory that God gave this command for His own benefit. Let us first see who is the great God, and then we can understand why He gave this command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who is God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HEN we come to examine the Bible, it is surprising how little the great Most High God has said about Himself; and the more we see who the great God is, the more we can reverence and love, adore and worship Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He is Jehovah, the Most High, the God of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things. (Psalm 83:18) He first appeared unto Abraham as Almighty, and said to Abraham: “I am the Almighty God.” (Genesis 17:1) He did not do this to compel Abraham to worship him, but in order that Abraham might have confidence and obey His commands. At that time He was not known by His name Jehovah, but afterwards He spoke unto Moses by the name Jehovah. (Exodus 6:3) He is the self-existing One, from everlasting to everlasting. (Psalm 90:2) He is the great Lord over all, and in Him is everlasting strength. (Isaiah 26:4) In him are wisdom, justice, power and love, complete and perfect, and equally and exactly balanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every good thing proceeds from Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God, and to Him is due all honor and praise. The Bible is His word as expressed to man, and every part of it when understood bespeaks the unselfishness of the great Jehovah God. This is why the inspired writer said of Him: “God is love.-” Love means the perfect expression of unselfishness, and in everything Jehovah has done He has been unselfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why then, you ask, would Jehovah command that the children of Israel should have no other God beside Him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">' Whff the Command?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TN THE light of unfolding prophecy we can seo more clearly why Jehovah gave this command to His people. He had selected them ■as a people for Himself. He had by the exercise of His loving kindness and power delivered them from Egypt, It was His purpose and desire to use this people as examples to His other creatures, and by and through them to make types foreshadowing the greater blessings to come to the human race; He desired to keep them apart ’and undefiled from wickedness and the influence 'of the wicked one. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- What was the necessity for this? one may ask. The answer is found'in the account of the creation and fall of man. God created Aclarn a perfect man. He then made a perfect woman as Adam’s companion. These two perfect creatures in the very nature of things would worship, and did worship, their great Creator and Benefactor. God then made Eden and planted a garden on the eastern side thereof, and there He put the man and his companion Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God appointed Lucifer, one of. Ills glorious and beautiful sons, called the Son of the Morning, to the position of overlord of earth. Concerning him Jehovah said: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth, and I have set thee so.”—Ezekiel 28:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer was ambitious. He desired to have some one to worship him. There necessarily existed a con fidcntial relationship between Lucifer and the great Jehovah God, because Jehovah had appointed him to a confidential place as overlord of man in the earth. The obligation rested upon Lucifer to be true, faithful and loyal to his Creator. But when an ambitious desire entered his heart he became a traitor, resorted to treachery, lying, fraud and deceit, which resulted in murder; and his great objective was to obtain the worship of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Isaiah (14:13,14) says: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into the heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will.ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the most High.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God had clothed Lucifer with the power and authority of death; that is to say, with authority to execute offenders. Should Adam and Eve violate God’s law, then it would become the duty and obligation of Lucifer as the executive officer to put them to death. God commanded that Adam and Eve should not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge in Eden, saying that in the day they did eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge they should die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures disclose that Lucifer reasoned like this: Adam and Eve now worship God, and if I can induce them to believe that God has lied and is trying to keep them ignorant by preventing them from eating certain fruits then .1 will get them to worship me, and not God. I have the power of death; the obligation rests upon me, but I will not put them to death. Having this power I can assure them that they will not die. Then when I can prove to them that God’s statement, “Thou shalt surely die,” is untrue they will believe me and refuse to believe Him; and therefore I will obtain their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer approached them and said to Eve, as recorded in Genesis 3:1: “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said, ... We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.” To this Lucifer, speaking through the serpent, said: “Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By this means Lucifer succeeded in deceiving Eve. But Adam, seeing that he would lose Eve because of her disobedience, willingly and deliberately partook of the fruit, and violated God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lucifer did not sentence them to death; but God called them before him, sentenced them to death, and changed the name of Lucifer to Satan, that old Serpent, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God could have killed the Devil there, but saw fit to permit Satan to exist and carry on his nefarious work to the end, that He might demonstrate the fulness and wickedness of sin, and that all the intelligent creatures of His universe might be tested as to their loyalty or disloyalty to the great Jehovah God. In other words God has permitted the Devil to go on with his nefarious work and has permitted every intelligent creature in the universe to exercise his free moral agency, and worship the true God, or worship the Devil and some of his institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From Eden down to the time when the children of Israel received the laws above mentioned, there were but few indeed that worshiped the true God. Amongst these are mentioned Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and others. The children of Israel were the descendants of Jacob, whose name was changed from Jacob to Israel. When Jehovah selected these people for Himself, for the purpose above stated, it was for their benefit that He commanded : “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” The Devil had overreached every nation on earth. All the other nations were worshiping images or worshiping the Devil himself, or some object that the Devil had put before them in order to turn their minds away from the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah knew that unless Israel would keep separate, and away from the contamination of Satan’s influence, they too would fall. For this reason, and for their benefit, He gave the command. The facts show that it was because of their yielding to Satan that that nation did fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle then states that all these experiences through which Israel passed were for the benefit of Christians, who in the Gospel Age might have a clearer view of God’s plan. In 1 Corinthians. 10:11 he says concerning Israel: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Therefore, let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now what I say here is not in the way of caustic criticism but with the hope of awakening some good, honest-hearted people to the true situation, that they may turn their hearts and minds away from a wrongful worship, and worship the only true and living God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question then is: Does the Catholic system recognize and worship Jehovah as the only true and living God? I answer: No. Their leaders teach both in their literature and by word of mouth that a woman is the mother of God, and teach their subjects to pray to a woman as though the woman could forgive sins. This is not said sarcastically, but because every Catholic knows that this is the truth. It is not unusual for one of them to pray: “Holy Mary, Mother of God, have mercy upon me.” They have erected all over the land crucifixes representing the crucifixion of Jesus, and they place His name above that of God. It is entirely proper to worship the Lord Jesus, but it is not proper to put His name above that of Jehovah. It is not true to say that Jesus is God; for Jesus plainly said: “My Father is greater than I.” (John 14:18) Again He said: “I can of mine own self do nothing” (John 5:30); and “I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”—John 6:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again the Catholics teach that a man whom they call pope or priest has the power to forgive sins. This is likewise a reflection upon the great and eternal God. In other words the result of the Catholic teaching has been to push the great Jehovah God into a corner and to magnify others. Evidently Satan has connived at this upon the theory that if he could not get the worship himself he would see that the creatures did not worship Jehovah God. God has pronounced the sentence of death against Satan and will in due time destroy him. But He is permitting the Devil to go the full limit of his wickedness, and Satan has taken every possible advantage of the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But one may say: Surely the Protestants worship the true God and give him the honor that is due to His name. The Scriptures declare (Psalm 29:2): “Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely the Modernists do not do this. The Modernists say that the Bible is not God’s Word; that the account of creation given in the Bible is not true, but that man is a creature of evolution ; that he has been gradually lifting himself up; that there has been no fall of man; and that therefore man does not need a redeemer. Stated in briefer phrase, the Modernists say God’s Word does not tell the truth. This is what Satan has always said. Therefore the god of the Modi ernists is the wisdom of their wise men, and this they worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But one will say: Surely the Fundamentalists worship the true God. Should I not join hands ■with them? The record discloses that they do not worship the true God, nor do they give His name the honor which is due to it. They teach the doctrine of eternal torment, that the great Jehovah God has provided a lake of fire and brimstone in which He will torment His creatures that do not worship and obey Him, and torment them eternally.''This is as false as Satan himself, and is a defamation of God's holy name. Furthermore, they teach the doctrine of inherent immortality and say: “There is no death.” This is identically the first lie that Satan ever told, and he told it for the very purpose of casting reflection upon the great name? of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, they teach the doctrine of the trinity, that God the Father, God the Son,<sup>-</sup> and God the Holy Ghost are one, equal in power and authority and in substance. This is clearly a defamation of the name of the Lord Jehovah and takes away from Him the worship to which He is entitled. This doctrine is not supported by any scripture in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, they claim to believe on the Lord Jehovah and yet deny the Lord’s kingdom, deny that. God will set up His kingdom in His own good way, but insist that they, as an organization, will set up the kingdom of God on earth, and that they are going to do this by bringing all the nations into their church. To this end now they join hands with the financial and political powers of the earth, which are admittedly a part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question is, then: Who is your God! Is it your desire to follow the teachings of some ecclesiastical system; or will you turn to the Scriptures, study them, get the correct knowledge of Jehovah, of His plan, of His beloved Son Christ Jesus, and worship Him in truth and in spirit, and learn the manner whereby He will bless all the families of the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God seeks not the worship of men for His own edification, nor for His own benefit. He seeks it for the benefit of His creatures. Every creature is so constituted that he must worship some higher being, or supposedly higher being. The -mass of mankind ignorantly worship dead objects, or some preacher, real or imaginary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who would benefit themselves and glorify the Creator will seek to know and to worship the only true God. That which man desires above everything else is life. Worshiping’ images, candles or wooden or stone crucifixes, worshiping beads or counting them, worshiping stone, worshiping the sun, worshiping gois or worshiping governments or power will never bring life and blessings to any creature. Th© Lord Jesus stated: “'This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is essential to know Jehovah’s plan and purpose and to follow the rules laid down by Him in order that the creature might enjoy the high privileges and the greatest degree of blessings.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Jews Rebuilding Palestine W <sup>G</sup>-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stewart</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font6">ANY have wondered why so numerous a people as the Jews do not have a nation of their own, especially when 3,000 years ago they were the most prominent people upon the earth. Because of God’s dealings with Abraham. He gave particular attention to the Jewish people; to them He gave the Law, supervising their welfare through judges and later through kings, giving them favor when obedient and punishing them when disobedient. The Lord through the Prophet Amos says: “You only have I known [dealt with] of all the families of the earth.” But the time came when because of unbelief they were to be chastened “seven times” (Leviticus 26:18, 24), which is a period of time running from the dethroning of Zedekiah in 606 B. C. to 1914 A. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God made two promises to Abraham: One was that in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed (Genesis 22:15-18); the other was pertaining to the land. “Look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.” (Genesis 13:14,15) St. Paul explains that the promised “seed” is Christ and His church. (Galatians 3:16,29; 4: 28) Therefore the Messiah for whom the faith-fnl Jews are looking Is the great composite priest and king—the glorified church, Jesus the Head and His members at the second advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews entered into covenant relation with God at Sinai, and Moses was the mediator. But the Mosaic covenant neither established the Jews in Palestine nor blessed all the families of the earth. The fact is that God’s dealings with the Jews were typical (Hebrews 10:1; 1 Corinthians 10:11); for the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sin actually. (Hebrews 10:4) God was there picturing- what would take place when the real sacrifice for sins -would be made and the new covenant be ushered in at the hands of the greater Mediator.—See Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:7-13; Dent. 18:15-19; Acts 3:19-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible abounds -with promises of the restoration of the Jewish people in their homeland. Stephen said that God had not fulfilled His promise to Abraham in his day. (Acts 7:5)’ In Romans, 11th chapter, there is a clear ao count of why Israel did not have the promises fulfilled to them. But they are not cast away, forever; for God’s promise is to receive them again when the full number from amongst the Gentiles is received to fill up the elect church of Christ. This work of selecting the church is almost completed; therefore the blindness of the Jews respecting Christ may be expected to vanish shortly.—Romans 11: 25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews were given a jubilee system to govern their national affairs, and there were to be seventy jubilees. This totals 3,500 years, beginning with the year 1575 B. C., and therefore terminating with this year, 1925. Thus we. are enabled to see that a preparatory work amongst the Jews under God’s overruling providence has been in progress for some time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” </span><span class="font3">( ^<sup>D</sup>^^T<sup>H</sup>BOOK<sup>Uy3</sup> ) » With issue Number CO we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, fTl The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both irSfg Advanced and Juvenile liible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>&lt;60</sup>The lamp represents the Word of God: as the psalmist says: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet.” (Psalm 119:105) Part of these virgins were wise; therefore they took oil in their vessels. The wise represent the bride class, the faithful ones; while the foolish ones picture a class of greater numbers who will not be of the bride class, hut who will be born on the spirit plane. While all these have waited for the coming of the Lord, the foolish ones have been indifferent. They have had no oil, have not had the spirit of truth, the loving zeal for the Lord and His cause; lienee they have been negligent. Whereas the wise' virgins have been watching; and they have kept their lamps trimmed and burning, which means that they have studied the Word of God and watched the fulfilment of prophecies, striving to develop the fruits and graces’ of the spirit and to bo prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom. As these, then, of the bride class come to a knowledge of the fact that the Bridegroom is present, they join in the cry: “Behold the Bridegroom 1” And they hasten to prepare to meet Him. During the time of the harvest of the Gospel Age, during the second presence of the Lord, members of the wise virgin class coming to a knowledge of the truth of His presence have rejoiced greatly because the Lord has returned; and the joy of the bride class has increased as the members have marked the ever-increasing evidence manifesting the Lord’s presence and the preparation for His kingdom. And as they have cried out: “Behold the Bridegroom !” they have been zealous in presenting the message of truth to others, that their hearts might be refreshed. The Lord has a special reward for those who love His second appearing, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">the apostle plainly stated. (2 Timothy 4: 8) There will not be a great, number of this bride class. On the contrary, they are small in number. Jesus said that there would be but a lit</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tle </span><span class="font6">flock. (Luke 12:32) Through the Revelator </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6">designates the number as 144,000.—Revela</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font6">14:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">the Gospel Age, beginning with the apostles at Pentecost. These have died and waited for the return of the Lord. Since the Scriptures show that the dead know not anything until the resurrection, it would be reasonable to expect the Lord to do something for these who had died faithful to their covenant and to expect that He would do something for them early in the time of His presence. St. Paul says: “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of G od: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”—1 Thessalonians 4:15-17.</span></p>

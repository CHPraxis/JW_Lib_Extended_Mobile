<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ib AsiBOTt Conan Doyle, spiritist, is widely quoted as saying that the denizens of the spirit world have repeatedly announced lately tlia t a great catastrophe is impending. He states that messages of this nature have been coming to him for the past three years, and that when the troubles come they will last for that length of time. It is possible that the demons have some advance notice of what is to happen soon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Armour-Morris Merger is O.K.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N THE opinion which reads like a judicial decision by the Supreme Court, the Secretary of Agriculture has ruled that the merger of two of the three greatest packers is not illegal. Attention is called to the fact that the combined business of Armour &amp;&nbsp;Company and Morris &amp;&nbsp;Company is about 25 percent of the meat inspected by the U. S. government, and that this combination is doing less business than Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company. Apparently more than half of the meat inspected by the government now passes through the hands of Armour and Swift.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Machinery Takes Place of Labor</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N A speech broadcast on Labor Day by the Solicitor of the Department of Labor, attention was called to the fact that the multiplication of inventions is making further immigration from Europe unnecessary. In the past year a single invention has increased the output of window-glass -workers from 55 square feet to 3,000 square feet per hour.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Policewomen in Three Hundred Cities</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE first policewoman was engaged at Portland, Oregon, twenty years ago. The duties are chiefly along the lines of crime prevention among the young. The work has proven so beneficial that three hundred other cities have adopted the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American Chud,</span><span class="font7"> a magazine devoted to the interests of child labor, contains an article by a young Italian girl narrating how, only a few years ago, she was accustomed to work in the bean fields during the entire season, from sunrise to dark, picking beans, and dragging the bean bag with her, at a daily wage of but thirty to forty cents.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Jacob’s Family Outnumbered</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">E READ in Genesis that when Jacob came into Egypt at the age of 130 he had seventy descendants, which seems like a good-sized family. But Hannah Eldred of Baldwin, L. I., who has just celebrated her 103rd birthday, is reported to have more than 200 descendants, or about three times as many as Jacob when he was twenty-seven years older.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Explosions of Combustible Dust</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">TAURING the last year there w’as a sufficient number of explosions in starch-manufacturing plants, in wood-working establishments, leather-grinding mills, feed-mixing plants and grain elevators to cause forty-five deaths and destroy property valued at three million dollars. There are always possibilities of dust explosions in many other factories, such as those producing cocoa, spice, sugar, corks, aluminum ware, etc.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Wretchedness of Poorhouses</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">THE Bureau of Labor Statistics has been mak-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-L </span><span class="font7">ing an investigation of poorhouses and declares that the supervision of these institutions; is chiefly in the hands of a class of politicians only-slightly superior to a majority of the inmates themselves. In these institutions, says the report, the worthy aged and infirm are herded with the feeble-minded and the prostitutes, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">state of indifference and neglect, practically </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font7">over the country. In Nevada it costs $865.10 per inmate to care for the poor, while the average inmate involves the expenditure of $334.64 for his maintenance, annually. More than one-third of all the almshouses in the country have ten or less inmates each, while more than half of the total have less than twenty-five each. The proposed remedy calls for larger and better managed institutions, centrally located.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Life Span Nearly Trebled</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">NSURANCE companies collect and study closely the evidence available regarding the length of human life. Their conclusions are that the average expectancy of life now is around fifty-eight years, whereas in the time of Columbus it was but twenty years. It is predicted by them that in twenty-five years the average American life span will be seventy years. As a, matter of fact our expectations are that it will be many times that, as we anticipate that very shortly now there will be a total cessation of what is commonly miscalled natural death. Actually, death is unnatural. Our first parents were not created to be put to death. Death came upon them only because of disobedience. Now the curse is lifting gradually; soon it will be removed altogether. Meantime, humanity has learned a great lesson.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Ball-Bearing Street-Cars</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font7">FOM Lynn, Massachusetts, comes news of an improvement in street-cars which should accomplish good results. For the first time, ballbearings, which have done so much to make automobiles and other machinery noiseless and frictionless, have been used in street-car construction. The noise of the car is greatly reduced, and oil and power will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Autos Nearly Equal Rail lime</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font7">ARLY in September two officials of the American Automobile Association drove a stock sedan car from Washington, D. C., to Oakland, California, in four days, twenty-one and one-half hours. The ear was driven about twenty hours daily. It was fitted with a Pullman bed, and very probably presages the day of automobile Pullmans which will thread the country in every direction, when the highways are in a condition to permit it. Meantime the highways are getting better and better every year, but it is safer to go by rail than by auto.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Governor Pinchot and the State Police</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">THE movements of the State Police of Pennsylvania are in the hands of Governor Pinchot. When the coal strike was declared Governor Pinchot instead of moving State Police into the anthracite mining district moved them out. The mine workers point out that during the last strike, when 158,000 miners were idle six months, there was not one case of violence; they promise similar conduct at this time.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Compounding of Felonies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">^THEORETICALLY the Chicago man who merely dismissed from his employ eight young men whom he detected as engaged in stealing from him, instead of turning them over to the police, was guilty of the crime of compounding a felony. It seems not to be generally known that it is as truly a crime in the eyes of the law to conceal the misdemeanor of another as to do the act itself.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Churches Doubtful of Prohibition</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">HDHE Research and Educational Department of the Federal Council of Churches has recently put out a questionnaire to some thousands of social workers in the effort to ascertain the results accomplished by national prohibition. The report of the investigation indicates that the value of national prohibition is in doubt, principally because of increased drinking by young people, as compared with pre-prohibi-tion days, and a worse general attitude toward law enforcement on the part of all classes. Otherwise the effects were said to be favorable, resulting in better furnishing of homes, better care of families, improved marital relations, and better sanitary and mental health conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hughes Sees Intolerance Developing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N HIS opening address to the American Bar Association Charles E. Hughes, former secretary of state, made the statement that in his opinion the most ominous sign of the times is the growth of an intolerant spirit, which is all the more dangerous because it seems to be armed with sincere conviction. He expressed the belief that liberty is now in need of safeguards against organized efforts being made by certain organizations not named, and by those politicians whom Mr. Hughes terms bureaucrats.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Where the Wealth Centers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Income Tax receipts give some interesting data as to where the larger incomes are being obtained. Of the total tax New York State pays 28%, Pennsylvania 10%, Illinois 9%, Massachusetts 6%, Michigan 6%, California 5%, Ohio 5%. These seven states pay 69% of the tax, while the remaining forty-one states average less than 1% each.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>End of Lighthouse Business</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">npiIE end of the lighthouse business is in sight During the past year automatic systems have been installed in seventy-four lighthouses, and it is claimed that they are less expensive and more reliable than the old style. Moreover, these automatic lighthouses can be placed in positions where it would be impossible to maintain keepers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Inconsistencies of Courts Martial</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE newspaper, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor,</span><span class="font7"> is indignant because a court martial at Washington acquitted a drunken major who drove wildly through the city, injuring some and endangering others, while another military court sentenced a young marine who refused to take a bath to serve two years in Portsmouth naval prison. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font7"> wants to know', and rightly, why these barbarities of courts martial are permitted in this country in a time of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wheat, Wheat Everywhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE people of the world cannot say in the year 1925 that the Lord has not blessed their wheatnelds. The Department of Agriculture has announced that the increase of crops for 1925 over 1924 in the twenty-four principal wheat-producing countries of the North Temperate Zone shows 230,000,000 bushels, or about ten percent increase in the total. There is also a large crop in Argentina and Australia.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Filming of Labor s Progress . &nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE American Federation of Labor is having a motion picture film prepared which will show'the progress of labor. Starting with the slave on the auction block it will portray home life, before the advent of the trade union, the degradation of the sweatshop and the sanitary workshops of the present. There is ample material for a wonderful film.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>A British View of America</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE secretary of the Rotarians of Great Britain, after a visit to six important Amer-&lt; ican cities, is quoted by the Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guar-i dian</span><span class="font7"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Production is enormously increasing, and we saw very few signs of drunkenness or breaking of the Jaw except along the frontier where smuggling takes place. In the inland cities we were struck with the cleanliness, sobriety and energy of the people. There seemed to ba no serious industrial crisis. We were greatly struck, too, with the progress made by the Negroes. There are whole districts in Chicago where large houses in handsome thoroughfares are occupied by the rich Negroes, who are to be seen driving about in their own motor-cars.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>No More Child Immigrants</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font7">ANADA will have no more child immigrants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For many years there has been a considerable influx of child labor from Britain, due to the necessities laid upon the British people to find some way to live since the World War upset their markets. But from now on no child immigrants under fourteen years of age will be admitted to Canada unless accompanied by parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Secret Kept Four Hundred Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> tells an interesting story of a secret kept for four hundred years. An old Indian on his death bed disclosed to his physician the whereabouts of the cave w'ithin which are the bars of gold and other treasures of the Aztec kings hidden when Cortez and his gang of murderers first invaded Mexico. Cortez tried in vain to locate this treasure.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>New Style of Trousers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE style mongers are always making fools of either the women or the men. This time it is the turn of the men. In London it is claimed that the men are now wearing trousers with legs forty-eight inches in circumference. The only possible advantage in this seems to be that in a large family of boys two of them could wear the one pair at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">ISPATCHES from Britain seem to indicate that both labor and capital are getting ready for what may be a desperate conflict. Labor, bending more and more in the direction of communism, is through its left wing persistently drilling into the minds of the army and navy that in case of industrial troubles they must not shoot their brothers. Capital, nervous and apprehensive, leans harder and harder upon . the government for protection. It seems only a matter of months before the storm will burst. John Wheatley, ex-cabinet minister (under the labor government), has issued a call for the establishment of a workers’ defence corps composed of ten million men who, to use Mr. Wheatley’s language, “are prepared to suffer rather than see Britain made a land of coolies.” Moreover, Mr. Wheatley demands that these be recruited during the nine months which the coal subsidy has to run. Apparently he expects civil war at the end of that time, and desires to have his army ready.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark132"></a>The Mission of the Golden Age</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Golden Age has entered its seventh year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems appropriate to reprint a portion of the Salutatory, as it appeared in Volume I, No. 1, issue of October 1, 1919, that our readers may judge of the value of its promises:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wisdom of the right order is essential to the welfare and happiness of mankind. During the few years recently past the world, through fiery experiences, has acquired a vast amount of knowledge; but how to apply that knowledge properly is now the important question. There is a perfect standard of application; and when that standard is known and followed, the result is certain to be satisfying. It is the privilege and duty of ■ every one who can do so to render aid to his fellow in the wise application of acquired knowledge and to a'd him to increase knowledge and wisdom. Such aid, to accomplish a good result, should be rendered unselfishly. “The wise man will hear and increase in learning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This magazine enters the field, therefore, with a mission which is peculiar and unique. It has no rivals because it has no competitors. Every one joining in a similar effort to do good will be welcomed by us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Its policy is and shall be not to array the rich against the poor, nor the poor against the rich, the classes against the masses, nor the masses against the classes; but it will seek to do good unto all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not published in the interest of any religious denomination, nor is it the advocate of any political party or organization. It is no respecter of persons because of race, color or condition of servitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nor is this magazine published for pecuniary profit or gain to anyone. All the money realized from its publication above the operating expenses will be used for the further dissemination of such knowledge amongst the people as will be beneficial to them. It is backed by some of the best and ablest men in the world, and shall be maintained as an educational medium for the purpose of teaching the true relationship between science, agriculture, labor and pure religion. Its publication is for the benefit of the people, advising them of perils and pointing them to a better and nobler life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Its purpose is to explain in the light of divine wisdom the time meaning of the great phenomena of the present day and to prove to thinking minds by evidence incontrovertible and convincing that the time of a greater blessing of mankind is now at hand. Like a voice in the wilderness of confusion, its mission is to announce the incoming of the golden age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations are in distress politically, financially and socially. Daily problems are arising, the solving of which seems beyond the power of human ingenuity. Seeing all these things coming to pass before our very eyes, who can lightly pass over the words of the Great Master foretelling these times when there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring, men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things coming upon the earth” I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These distressing times have come at the very climax of the development of inventive genius—at the very time of the greatest increase of knowledge. And why? There is a reason, and that reason we must ascertain and govern ourselves accordingly. There is a wide diversity of knowledge which, if properly applied, would result in great and beneficial wisdom to the people. What, then, is the real meaning of the present conditions, and is' there a supreme remedy that will bring order out of chaos and establish a lasting peace, prosperity and happiness to the people? The Golden- Age enters the field for the very purpose of answering these questions, and confidently expects to answer them to the satisfaction of all thinking minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age will carry into the homes of the people the desired message which will tend to restore calmness to the disturbed minds and comfort to the saddened hearts. We do not expect to accomplish this </span><span class="font5">by human wisdom; because that has been tried and failed, and such wisdom is foolishness in the sight of Jehovah. But we will point the people to the clear and indisputable evidence in the light of present-day events, disclosing the divinely expressed remedy for the reconstruction of human affairs that will bring the desire of all nations, assuring to the people life, liberty and happiness. We invite all order-loving, law-abiding, God-fearing persons to aid in passing this message of comfort on to those who desire to be comforted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the foregoing Salutatory we now wish to add a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a few issues we have run advertisements of something besides the books of the International Bible Students’ Association. In a few issues also we have referred to inventions, books or other items that we judged might be of value to some of our readers. In most instances, we think, our judgment of the value of these things was good; but where the information we received at first was based upon insufficient data or experience of the party furnishing it, then it occasionally turned out that the announcement was inadvisable or premature. We make no claim to infallibility, but do try to be honest, fearless, sincere and helpful. If we make mistakes forgive us. We repent “seventy times seven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some six months ago we published an article on Automatic Electronic Diagnosis by Dr. Gamble, explaining the principles of the Biola, a device for aiding the sick along lines somewhat similar to the operation of the radio in carrying the human voice. The explanation as Dr. Gamble made it seemed so reasonable that we could hardly forbear publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Gamble has now sent us some concrete evidence that his device has proven what he hoped it would; and as a vindication of our judgment in publishing the original article from him, and possible as a benefit to our readers, we publish the gist of these, omitting postoffices. We want to benefit the people; but lest by some publication we unwittingly mislead, our future policy will be:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hereafter we shall publish no advertisements or articles other than the books of the International Bible Students Association, nor any writeups of articles which, however valuable they may be, might seem to be hints to purchase. The Golden Age is not an advertising medium, except for books giving religious instruction which we endorse because we believe them to be the true explanations of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have been using the Biola over two months. I had an intestinal trouble, centered in my colon. My side pained me constantly. Now I rarely feel it and I think my general health is better, especially a catarrhal trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mississippi, Sept. 19, 1925. Mbs. Eva Hosmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Biola, treatment has proven the most satisfactory and lasting of all remedies I have ever tried. I have used it only one month. I improved from the very first start. I had time to use it only at night after a hard day’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No words of praise can do it justice; it is one of the greatest inventions of the age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kansas, Sept. 18, 1925. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0. J. Berger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Replying to your letter requesting our experience with the Biola, will say we have net had any acute cases to try the machine on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two of our family have taken quite a number of treatments, both of these had previously been helped a great deal by the Abrams Method. However they were both in a condition that seemed to need regular treatments in order to keep them from becoming run down. The Biola seemed to fill this need in a most satisfactory manner. We bought the machine mainly upon the favorable mention made of it in The Golden Age publication, and we are glad to say that we feel that our confidence was not misplaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had confidence in the machine to start with and now we have more. We heartily recommend the machine on every proper occasion and you are at liberty to use anything said in this letter in any way you see fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">South Carolina, Sept. 17, 1925. W. C. Bolen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After having used the Biola for five weeks, will say that it has helped me wonderfully. When I began taking treatments I could hardly bear to lie on my back to take a treatment. Now my back bothers me but very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My children are using the Biola also, and it has helped them, too. My oldest daughter was very much under weight and had no appetite. Now she has such an appetite that she can hardly get enough to eat and she says the Biola is responsible for it. She says that she is much better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are pleased with the Biola.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New Mexico, Sept. 13, 1925. Mrs. John W. Buckner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Biola has now been used thirty days and the results are most satisfactory. My mother was suffering from neuritis; but after treatments the pain decreased, and in three weeks she looked well. She is continuing tire treatments to prevent a recurrence of the pain. As she is sixty-six years of age and at first was very ill, we think that this is most wonderful</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I also took the treatment, being in a very run-down state. One week made a great improvement; and in three weeks people said: “How well you look!” instead of the reverse. It is a wonderful invention, befitting this wonderful age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">British Columbia, July 17, 1925. M. L. Mitchell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In regard to our treatment, I can only add to my last letter that we have not had any sickness in our family since we began treatment, several months agb. I can only give the Biola credit, because some of us were feeling bad all of the time. My wife has gained at least twenty-five pounds. She really needed to gain somewhat. I weighed 259 and was gaining every day; but I have not gained any more, and I can get around a good deal better with more pep. We have seven in family, children look well and also feel well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">North Carolina, Sept. 15, 1925. J. O. Newton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have now tried the Biola one month and have had very good results. My sickness is of long standing and will take some time yet to cure. I am fifty-four years of age; yet when I was nineteen, doctors said that I would die soon. My trouble is bronchial, and my lungs are affected. I really believe I am going to get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ohio, June 30, 1925 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elis Gouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have now used your Biola two months and I am very much improved in health. I can say the Biola does all that you claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ohio, July 30, 1925 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elis Gouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I want to tell you how much my mother has improved from taking the Biola treatments. She had not been able to sleep well at night for about twenty years. After two months treatment she sleeps fine and feels better in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Virginia, August 1, 1925. Mrs. M. L. Jobson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Biola which I purcha^d some time ago has, I believe, completely cured me of indigestion with which I was troubled a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Minnesota, Sept. 17, 1925. A. A. Buckingham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I feel that I have been very much benefitted by using the Biola. When I began using it, my kidney seemed very weak (I have only one) and acted poorly. After using the Biola two weeks I felt a great deal, of improvement. I can sleep better, my kidney acts freely, and my food digests well. I have used the Biola six weeks and am going to continue because my trouble is of long standing. I certainly believe that it is good to put vitality into the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before using the Biola I had terrible dreams and would scream in my sleep. Since using I have not had them, and also am relieved of bad headaches.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Growing Bananas in Florida </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By w. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">e.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> Bolles</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is much food for thought in your recent article on “The Weather and Its Freaks”. May I bear further witness that world conditions are changing? Bananas were once considered a strictly tropical fruit; the plants were supposed to thrive only near the equator. But in semi-tropical or sub-tropical Florida, entirely outside the equatorial zone, we are setting out banana plantations by the hundreds of acres, and are making handsome profits from the big crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the last convention of the Florida Banana Growers’ Association, of which I am secretary, there were more than 400 people talking nothing but bananas all day. My friend, Mr. T. J. Harris, who has had years of banana experience in the tropics, says the Cavendish variety of banana does better in Florida and bears larger bunches of fruit than he ever saw it produce anywhere in the tropical zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On my own plantation at Oldsmar, fifteen miles west of Tampa—which is about midway on the west coast, or Gulf of Mexico side, of Florida—I have twelve varieties of bananas, including the Cavendish, the red banana, the true tropical Martinique or Gros Michel </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{Musa sapientum)</span><span class="font7"> and others; and they are all doing so well that I am about to plant 200 acres more. I am not a member of the I. B. S. A., but I find in The Golden Age the kind of reading that gets me somewhere.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Commercial Banana Growing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE growing of bananas is a commercial success in Florida. They are the easiest fruit to grow; for the beautiful plants can yield heavy, money-making crops in the first year or in the early part of the second year, giving results up to $400 to $1,000 or more per acre per year when properly handled as described in these pages. The plants are practically free from insects and diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many kinds of soil are suited to bananas. The best are truck soils, dark sandy loams, muck, low hammock, flatwoods, drained swamps and drained prairie lands, high hammock, etc. They must have enough drainage to protect them from being drowned by heavy rains or overflows. One woman wrote me that her plants came through after being flooded for about five weeks, but we do not recommend such treatment. They will stand more moisture than most fruit trees and do their best when they have plenty of it. Good locations for plantations are on the sides of lakes, ponds, swamps and creeks, setting the plants far enough back that they will not have to stand in soaking wet, soggy land. Unproductive land along a ditch and land too low for other crops can often be used to grow good crops of bananas.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>The Best Varieties</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">rpiIE best varieties are Cavendish, Hart, Ladyfinger, Orinoco and Martinique, which bear large bunches of superior fruit. They are suited to the semi-tropical climate, are the hardiest of the good-fruiting varieties and well endure cool weather. Bananas have stood the tests of more than thirty years in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. The experimental stage was passed long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Banana growing is today a practical, profitable business proposition, and they are being planted commercially by money-making men and women. The acreage is increasing every year. Every family in Florida can have bananas in their yards and grow their own. A plant will bear in six to eighteen months from the time of setting, depending on the size of the plant and the method of handling it. The cities and towns in Florida consume much more than we have produced commercially. After we supply this home demand we will ship into other states where there is an enormous market waiting for us, because about 45,000,000 bunches of bananas are imported into the United States every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Florida-grown bananas sell by the bunch at wholesale at the same prices as the imported article, seven to eight cents a pound. Usually the retail price in Florida is 10 to 15 cents a pound. Bunches weigh up to 50 or 100 pounds or more. Fifty pounds at seven cents per pound means $3.50 per bunch. By setting 400 plants to the acre, which is customary (that means 400 bunches or more per acre when properly handled) and at $3.50 per bunch, it makes a total of $1,400 per acre per year, when the plants are well started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Cavendish banana plant is sometimes called the Canary Island and the Chinese, but the correct name is Cavendish. It bears large bunches, sometimes weighing up to 125 pounds, having 200 to 250 bananas. The plants grow six to ten feet high in different kinds of soil, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">therefore resist the winds better than the tallest varieties. It is one of the hardiest of the big fruiters and endures cool weather. The fruit is about the same size as the imported banana. The Improved Cavendish grows somewhat taller and bears big bunches. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hart is another excellent variety to plant in the United States. It bears large bunches, is taller and more tropical-looking than the Cavendish, has a shell-pink color on the trunk and leafstems, and is very ornamental. It is healthy and stands cool weather. The fruits have an exceedingly fine flavor. Its scientific ndme is Champa, and this variety is highly esteemed in the tropics. It is sometimes called Ladyfinger. There is a special strain of Hart bananas in Florida which grow as large as imported bananas and have a much better flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Orinoco, sometimes called the horse banana, is an old favorite, grows tall and majestic, stands cool weather, has the largest fruits of any banana grown in Florida, with flavor equal to the imported; and the bunches are of good size. It is grown for fruit as far north as Southern Georgia and South Carolina, and for ornamental purposes in North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Martinique (sometimes called the Yellow Jamaica, the Honduras, the South American and the Gros Michel), is the variety of banana grown in such enormous quantities in the West Indies and in Central and South America, for export into the United States. It is the kind ordinarily seen in fruit shops and grocery stores. It is thicker-skinned than the other varieties, and is beyond doubt the best for shipping. It is grown in Florida successfully, and stands today as the world’s leading commercial variety. The plants grow tall and the bunches are large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Red Jamaica is sometimes seen on the fruit stands. It is a very ornamental variety, having trunks and mid-ribs of a rich red wine color. The bunches are medium, the fruits are of good size, and have a delightful flavor. They generally sell at five cents per fruit at retail. A few of these are grown in Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Giant Abyssinian banana </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Mitsa ensete) </span><span class="font7">is said to be the largest variety of banana. It does not bear good fruit, but grows to an astonishing size and height when well cared for, and is a magnificent tropical ornament which will attract favorable notice anywhere in competition with the finest and best palm trees. It is a rapid and healthy grower, as hardy as any fruiting variety of banana. It is well worth having specimens of this stately ornamental banana in your collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For commercial purposes, and also for the home garden, we recommend the following fruiting varieties: Cavendish, Hart, Ladyfinger, Martinique, Orinoco and Red Jamaica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When well-grown and properly cared for, bananas grow large bunches which are called standard, or full bunches, when they have nine “hands” or clusters of bananas on one stem, and twelve to twenty-four “fingers” on each hand. Often they will have more or less than nine hands, but as they are usually sold by the pound, both at wholesale and retail, the bunches of other than nine hands are O. K. The better you feed and care for your bananas, the more likely you are to grow large, commercial-size bunches; and the more bunches you will harvest per acre.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Planting and Fertilization &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">SETTING banana plants, if you will dig the holes large, the plants will start better, grow faster and bear fruit considerably sooner. The holes should be dug two feet six inches every way—width, length and depth. Keep the top soil separate from the sub-soil when throwing it out. Mix half manure and half top-soil in the bottom of the hole, filling it that way up to -within ten inches of the top. Set the bulb or plant upright, fill in with the bottom soil mixed -with more manure, then pour on slowly one or two pails of water, if the ground is dry and no rain in sight. Treat them right, and they’ll treat you right. You can plant bananas any month in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the ground has been prepared, the cost of plants, fertilizer and labor to plant one acre will run from around $250 to $600, according to the variety selected, some plants costing more than others; and also depending on how good a job is made of it. Many people start off with 100 of two varieties, to see which is better adapted to .their soil and district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The distance apart always starts an argument, the same as when discussing the best way to plant other fruit trees. Experience favors just as many plants as possible per acre for intensive banana farming. The Cavendish can be set 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 feet apart in the rows, with the rows 8 or 10 feet apart, to give room to get down between the rows with plow, harrow, fertilizer and to take out the fruit. Harts can be planted 10 x 10, which is 435 per acre. By planting closely, your land yields more fruit per acre; the bananas will shade the ground, kill or retard the grass and weeds by their shade, and help keep the soil cool and moist. It takes no more fertilizer to feed plants close together than when far apart, and it is less work. Some growers plant Harts 8x8, which is 680 to the acre, or 8 x 10, which is 544 to the acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best fertilizers include both fresh and rotted manures—stable, dairy, poultry, goat and sheep. Put on all you can get, the more the better for money-making results. Castor pomace, one ton to the acre per year, is fine to make them grow. Acid phosphate, one ton per acre, helps them to bear big bunches earlier. Hardwood ashes, one ton per acre per year, help to harden the trunks and the skins of the banana fruits and makes them ship better. It is the potash in the ashes which accomplishes this. Or use 5—7—5 mixed commercial vegetable fertilizer, made largely from organic sources, one ton per acre per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experience proves that it pays well to spend about $100 per acre annually for fertilizers when you are growing a crop that will run up to $1,000 per acre or better under favorable conditions. If your land is muck-or low hammock or good flatwoods, you do not need so much ammonia or nitrogen; so you could cut down the castor pomace and the ammonia in the mixed fertilizers by about half. It is a good plan to divide the one ton mentioned into three applications, using one-third of a ton in February or March, another third in May or June, just before the rainy season opens, and the last third after the rainy season closes in September or October. You will not need all the above fertilizers. Study your land and buy what it requires.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Mulching and Pruning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font7">UT on all the dry mulch you can get—dead grass, dead weeds, old sugar cane pomace, dry velvet bean and cow pea vines, etc., anything which -will decay and make more vegetable matter or humus in the soil, because humus is real plant food and saves fertilizer bills. Mulch also keeps the roots shady and cool in summer, and warmer in winter, promotes nitrification in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">soil, and helps keep the ground in a favorable mellow condition for healty growth and fruitage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One stalk or trunk bears only one bunch; and after that bunch has been harvested, let the trunk stand a couple of weeks to permit the sap to be absorbed by the roots, then cut that stalk off about three inches above the surface of the ground, cut the stalk into small pieces and spread it around the plant as mulch. The roots throw up suckers, ’which grow and become fullsized plants, and each will bear one bunch of fruit in its turn. The original plant bulb goes on putting up bearing stalks indefinitely. So there is no need to replant them. The varieties do not “mix” when planted near<sup>-</sup> each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is best not to allow more than three suckers to each root in addition to the main stalk. Let the main stalk which is about to bear be called 4-4, the next in size should be % grown, the next i/&gt;, and the next or just a little peeper getting ready to put out its first narrow leaves. Try not to have two suckers of the same size on one root. Let different sized ones be coming along, and after the plant gets going right, you may be able to harvest two or three bunches per year from one stool. You can cut off the extra suckers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cut the bunch when the fruit is mature in size and still green in color. It is ready when practically all of the angles of the fruit are filled out nearly round. Hang the bunch in a dark place, and it will ripen and color evenly. If you want to hasten this process, hang it in a dark room, closed, with an electric light or lamp burning low to furnish more heat to speed the process of ripening. For shipping always send your best hard and green well-filled fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Many uninformed people have the wrong impression that you get a crop of bananas only once in a while on account of cool weather. One grower told me he harvested eight good crops in ten years in middle Florida, and did fairly well in the other two years, which is as good if not better than the records of truck farmers and orange growers. Bananas have been grown commercially in Florida for about thirty years. In February, 1923, there was a frost and a short freeze in some parts of Florida, the mercury going down to around 28° or 30° above zero. Indifferent places the banana leaves were frozen and turned brown, but the stalks and roots were unhurt. The leaves came out again fine and dandy in about two weeks, and the stalks produced fruit in the summer of 1923.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Irrigation and Cultivation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">RRIGATION is not necessary in order to grow bananas, especially if you select a somewhat moist or damp location, with drainage. Irrigation is a very good advantage, however, for any grower, because it enables him. to get water to his plants in the unusually dry spells; and in event of predictions of frost by the weather bureau, it is a good precaution io flood your field. The water will be warmer than the air in the event of a frost, and thus the water will temper or warm the air, and generally prevent damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shallow cultivation is the rule after the banana plants have gotten started growing. Many of the feeder roots are close to the surface. Clean cultivation is recommended because grass and weeds take moisture and food away from the banana plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bananas are practically a continuous crop, maturing fruit in nearly every month in the year. Bunches ripen faster in the spring and summer, but there is no month which is regularly unproductive. The banana is one of the most tropical-looking plants in Florida and lends an appearance of luxuriance which no other plant can equal. The banana is in a class with the cocoa-nut tree and the Royal palm as ornamental emblems of the semi-tropical character of our climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The banana fruit comes to you sealed by nature in a germ-proof cover. No worm, blight, nor insect sting affects the fruit within. The fruit is very nourishing, containing three times the protein of the apple, nearly twice as much carbohydrates and three times as much fat as the orange, and exceeds even the potato by about twenty percent in food value. The banana is considered the most popular food-fruit. .</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Demand Exceeds Supply</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE acreage planted to bananas in Florida has been doubled, and yet we are a long way from being able to supply all the fruit which our own state alone can consume. I have received requests for carload, shipments which none of our members was in position to fill. My own crop is sold for two years ahead. I am planting five acres additional in the suburbs of Tampa and getting ready to plant eighty acres more in the same neighborhood. I am also interested m two other large plantings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Cavendish, Hart and Ladyfinger varieties are maintaining their lead in popularity. All of them will produce good nine-hand bunches in Florida, weighing thirty to sixty pounds or more, and that is large enough to suit the commercial requirements. We hear our growers once in a while speaking proudly about 100 or 125 pound bunches, which are good for the state and county fairs; but the regular retail trade is all based upon the handy nine-hand bunch as the standard. The banana crate factories make the crates to suit the average bunch, while as a matter of fact about nine-tenths of all the bananas are shipped without any crates and in carload lots. Many bunches of imported bananas weigh less than thirty-five pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Florida banana growers have established this very profitable food-fruit industry in our state on a strictly scientific and practical basis, and have already shown the planters in other countries a thing or two they did not know about bananas. In Florida we plant and cultivate bananas intensively, getting the largest amount of production per acre of all the banana-growing districts in the world. We plant scientifically, we take better care of them than they do in the tropics, consequently we must and do make more money per acre than they do. It is a common thing in Florida to make $400 per acre inside the first twelve months after planting, and as high as $1,000 to $2,000 per acre in the second and following years.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Florida’s Climate Ideal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE increase in the business of growing bananas commercially in Florida is surprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In all parts of this State new plantings are being made, from small patches up to ten acres or more, and one man is preparing to put in forty acres. A friend -who owns fifty acres of orange groves told me a few weeks ago he makes more per acre from bananas than from citrus fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have reports that South Texas is going in for banana-growing, too. Southern California is doing very little with bananas and South Texas is only starting. All of Florida is farther south than any part of the State of California. We have both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stream. Florida is a peninsula with much better water protection against cool weather than either Texas or California can claim. Florida is destined to be a great banana-producing’ state because it has the best natural qualifications. This has been proved by twenty years’ experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Good bunches of Florida bananas weigh from fifty to 100 pounds and sell wholesale at six to eight cents a pound. On the basis of fifty-pound bunches at six cents a pound, we get $3 per bunch. It is'possible to produce 400 bunches per acre after, the first year, which means $1,200 per acre in the second year after planting. The plants are set 400 to the acre and an experienced grower should surely get one bunch from each plant. An expert can get two bunches per year from half of his plants and one bunch from the other half, a total of 600 bunches per acre per year, which at $3 per bunch makes the impressive total of $1,800 per acre annually. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under such conditions it pays to spend about $100 per acre per year for fertilizers. The banana plant is the hog of the fruit world. It is a great eater; and the more it eats, the more it can produce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>Cavendish, Hart, Orinoco</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Cavendish has three special advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It produces large bunches of fruit with excellent flavor, it is a low-growing plant and therefore resists high wands, and it is reported in the tropics to be immune from the Panama disease which caused trouble among the banana growers of Jamaica, Honduras and other great banana-productlng districts. This disease has not appeared in Florida. Probably the climate here is sufficiently sub-tropical to change the conditions which cause trouble in the heat of the equatorial regions; and the careful inspection made by the Florida State Plant Board should be given full credit for preventing troubles. This means a big advantage for Florida banana growers, so I confidently look forward to the time when Florida will be producing and selling millions of bunches, the same as we sell millions of boxes.of oranges. , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hart banana, sometimes called Hart’s Choice, Ladyfinger or Golden Early, is a tall-growing variety with a pink-colored trunk, very ornamental, and bears bunches of fruit having a flavor about the same as the Cavendish, but the fruits are smaller, hence the name of Ladyfinger. Both the Cavendish and the/Hart are better flavored than the common imported Martinique, sometimes called Yellow Jamaica. I can recommend both the Cavendish and the Hart to anyone in Florida. They are doing well on my banana plantation at Oldsmar, and I have seen them producing, as far-north as the latitude of Sanford and farther. With proper care they should bear fruit as far north as Jacksonville. The Cavendish is grown in large quantities in the Canary Islands, ,in latitude about the same as Jacksonville, and is the leading banana sold in England and parts of continental Europe. Indications are it will be the leader in Florida on account of its all-around excellence, because it seems to be perfectly at home all. through Florida. I have tried out about a dozen varieties in the last five years and still have them on my. plantation at Oldsmar as part of my collection, but for commercial purposes I stand by the three leading varieties for Florida in the following order: Cavendish, Hart and Orinoco. The Red Jamaica is a shy bearer. The Martinique has not done so well in Florida as it docs in the equatorial regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The banana will stand some overflows, but too much water can do harm as ■well as too little. It loves plenty of moisture, so if you have a flowing well or artesian water supply you can grow bananas successfully on high hammock, high pine or orange grove soils. Muck lands and low hammock lands are the best, and good flatwoods land is satisfactory. Give the banana plants plenty to eat and drink, and do not drown them, and watch the money roll in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since writing the foregoing article, I have received information from a correspondent at Port Antonio, Jamaica, who reports that the Panama disease, after ruining many banana plantations in Central and South America, now appears to be destroying the banana business of the isIaiMl of Jamaica, which has been shipping annually between 10,000,000 and 15,000,000 bunches. He says from present indications, the banana business cannot survive there more than 10 or 15 years. The Jamaican authorities are fighting the progress of the disease in different places, but have found no cure for it. The growers are cooperating to the limit of their ability. They have no delusions on the subject. They say the end is in sight; for the Yellow Jamaica or Mar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unique banana seems to be doomed in Jamaica. The land.on which, the blight appears cannot be used for bananas again, even after ten years of other crops, which the Panama disease does not-hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If there is any better argument for the increase of banana- growing in Florida, and especially for the cultivation of our dear friend, the Cavendish, which never has the Panama malady, I would like to know it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Recipe for a Complete Nourishing Meal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7"> SUBSCRIBER in New Zealand, enthusiastic over her own greatly improved physical condition and that of her friends as a result of limiting her diet to raw fruits, nuts and uncooked vegetables, gives the following as a recipe for a complete nourishing meal. The advantage about this meal is that it can be eaten a bite at a time while other work is being done. Results are claimed as in the very highest, degree satisfactory; no weakness, no fatigue, no disease, but a superabundance of vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take equal parts of nuts (any kind, but peanuts not so good), figs, dates, prunes, raisins; put all through the mincer; then mix well and beat hard with rolling pin. Cut in caramels or roil in small balls, and roll in dessicatod cocoanut. Put in tin to keep; will keep any length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same lady sends us the following pointed article from the pen of James R. Devereux, a famous health export of New Zealand and editor of a dietary and anti-cancer magazine. Mr. Devereux says savagely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not food cranks. You are the food cranks. We are health cranks—-positive fiends for health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Food is only a means to an end—viz., securing that glorious and wonderful feeling that fences were made to bound over and mountains made to climb without fatigue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How is your tongue in the morning ? How do you fed after the fried eggs and pig (with all due sympathy for the poor' defenceless pig), the porridge, and toast and marmalade, with a few cups of tea, etc., etc. ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who are the food cranks—you or we ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a fruit meal, a nut meal, and a vegetable meal. In very cold weather we sometimes have the nut meal first, as nuts provide warmth and heat. Sometimes we have the vegetable meal first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a rule, however, we begin with a fruit meal consisting of any fruits or berries which are obtainable and cheap, such as oranges, apples, pears, cherries, peaches, apricots, very ripe bananas, pineapples, and so on. As fruit does not combine well with any other food, such as cereals, vegetables, etc., we have only fruit, and as much as we can eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For dinner we then have nuts, such as almonds, Brazils, walnuts, and often dried fruits, as sultanas, figs, dates, etc., occasionally having some fresh fruit as well, as this combination is not quite so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For ‘&quot;tea” we have a vegetable meal and our table is covered with dishes of lettuce, celery, spring cabbage, mustard and cress, tomatoes, radishes, onions, cucumbers, raw carrots (which are delicious when one gets used to the idea), watercress, cauliflower or any vegetable we can obtain that it is possible to eat uncooked. And our table looks delicious, I may say. At this meal, and this meal only, we eat a few slices of wholemeal bread with a thin scraping of butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Salt and sugar, white flour and every other so-called food which has been deprived of its sixteen elements or had the combinations altered, we haw abandoned; and there is the secret of our dietary. Fruits feed and cleanse the tissues, and green vegetables feed and cleanse, the blood. It is absolutely astounding, on this dietary, the small amount of food required. Nature tells you when to stop eating and this is a very difficult matter when living on cooked foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Y’ou will work harder and never be tired, and you will feel light and clean, and full of the joy of life. Disease will gradually be expelled. Expelled, mind you— not suppressed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may have a few expelling symptoms, such as diarrhoea, colds, boils, pimples, etc., and a day or two’s depression, while the expelling process is taking place, but this is the only method of real cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking directly of her own experience with the above diet, our New Zealand friend says f</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I thought I was at the end of my journey two years ago. I was almost stone deaf and became so stout all at once. I took myself in hand, had three short fasts, the longest a week. Mr. Devereux does not believe in. long fasts. After a few weeks of this diet I was a different woman. Today my hearing is better and my health is A-l. I am fifty-four years old and yet doing all the work of the house, washing and ironing, and have two men to look after, and I do some canvassing. I am as slim as I was at forty, and can keep up with anyone. Headaches, to which I was a martyr all my life, are things of the past. Catarrh! I was nearly dead with it in Manchester, England; but today I do not need a handkerchief, and can cycle for miles in the wind. Many of my friends in this vicinity have taken up with this diet and it is working wonders in every family where it bar been tried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Misleading Press </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">ITH the coming of the Lord’s kingdom His followers have a clearer vision of Satan’s organization than ever before. The Lord took onto Himself His power and began His reign in 1914. He came into His temple in 1918. For some years now the followers of the great King have seen that the visible part of Satan’s empire is. made up of the ruling factors of this world, to wit: commercial, political and ecclesiastical powers working hand in hand to blind the people and turn their minds away from God. It becomes the solemn duty of every anointed child of the Lord to declare God’s vengeance against these wicked allies, and to declare it by plainly telling the people of its existence and that God purposes to overthrow it with His righteous government. The Christian has nothing to do with the overthrow. His part is to be a witness for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For some years the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Era Enterprise</span><span class="font7"> at St. Paul, has been pretending to publish the truth and has by this means secured many subscriptions from consecrated persons in present truth throughout the world. It has posed as being in perfect harmony with the King and the kingdom message. Of course, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Era Enterprise</span><span class="font7"> or any other paper is privileged to publish whatever pleases the publisher. But the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enterprise</span><span class="font7"> or any other paper has no right to garble the message of truth that is put out for the people, or omit an important part of it while claiming to publish it complete. It becomes necessary' for the protection of God’s people to use plainness of speech, and this I here do in order that my friends might understand. This matter has just now been called to my attention, or I would have spoken about it sooner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Columbus, Ohio, in August, 1924, I addressed a large public audience at the Stadium on the subject “Civilization Doomed”. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font7"> carried a verbatim report of that discourse. Later millions of copies were published and distributed throughout the world. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Era Enterprise</span><span class="font7"> carried an advertisement with reference to this discourse, amongst other things saying this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;This Is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">complete report</span><span class="font4"> of the wonderful discourse given by Judge Rutherford In the Ohio Stadium to an audience of 30,000 people. It is indeed the message of the hour and should </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be in </span><span class="font4">the hands </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of every </span><span class="font4">thinking Christian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon the strength of this advertisement, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enterprise</span><span class="font7"> solicited subscriptions from my friends throughout the world, and then published on its front page in large headlines what purported to be a verbatim report of the dis. course. It appears, however, that its. editor deleted from that discourse every one of the following paragraphs, which refer to the Devil’s visible representatives on earth, to wit: the commercial, political and ecclesiastical powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To enable Bible Students to see the duplicity practised I here quote from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Jottrnal,</span><span class="font7"> a worldly newspaper, the paragraphs deleted by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Era Enterprise,</span><span class="font7"> which poses as a representative of the Lord’s kingdom. I leave it to all fair-minded students of the Scriptures to determine whether or not these paragraphs should have been deleted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The desire for bodily ease and comfort; the desire to be approved by men rather than have the approval of God; and ambition for the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom on earth before due time and contrary to his way, has caused the clergy to fall to the seductive influence of Satan; to become unfaithful to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ and to form a part of presentcivilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The clergy have admitted into their church organizations the greedy profiteers and the faithless politicians, and have made them the principal of their flock. They were taught by the Lord that Satan is the god of this evil world, yet they have willingly become a part of it. They have failed to defend the poor and fatherless and have delivered them into the hands of the greedy, wicked ones to serve as targets for the war. They have dealt unjustly with the afflicted and needy and indulged in the wicked persecution of the meek and lowly followers of the Prince of Peace, who dare to tell the truth; and have caused the arrest, imprisonment and death of such.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the world war the persecution of humble and faithful followers of Jesus started in Germany, spreading to England, to Canada and to America, and the records show that a more relentless persecution was never indulged in by human beings. This persecution of Christians was inspired and carried on by clergymen and their allies in politics and profiteering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jesus declared that at the same time there would be a great falling away from the faith, and it is a well known fact that during the past 10 years there has arisen the greatest apostacy amongst the clergy known in any times past. The Modernists have assumed a bold position, denying the Word of God, denying, the. fall of man and the redemption by Christ Jesus, and teach</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">instead the doctrine of evolution, which is destructive of faith in God’s Word. They have engaged in controversy with the Fundamentalists, who claim to believe the Bible, yet in truth and in fact, deny the teachings of Jesus, His kingdom and the blessings it will bring.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When the profiteers and politicians brought forth a League of Nations, manifestly the product of the devil, to keep mankind in subjection to him, the clergy with one accord hailed it as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth and urged the people to join it. Herein they were guilty of blasphemy, as the prophet had foretold, because assuming to be teachers of God’s Word they declared a man-made institution, superinduced and managed by Satan, to represent the kingdom of God. They should have known that God, through His prophet, had plainly stated that a combination such as the League of Nations could never stand. This warning He plainly gave through His prophet in these words; ‘Associate yourselves, all of ye far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word and it shall not stand.’—Isaiah 8: 9,10.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The clergy, having claimed to represent the Lord and assumed His name, are called in the Scriptures by - the title gods or mighty ones to judge amongst the people. It would be understood, of course, that when the world ends, which is now an established fact, that the time of God’s judgment upon the nations and upon the gods or mighty ones composing the ruling factors of the nations, would take place. Of that time the prophet says: ‘God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth amongst the gods [chief ones in ecclesiasticism].’ To these he says: ‘How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? [Which they have done.] Defend the poor and fatherless ; do justice to the afflicted and needy. [Which they have not done.] Deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the hand of the wicked.’ [Which they have failed to do.]—Psalm 32:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The great events happening since 1914 in fulfilment of the prophetic words of Jesus were sufficient to awaken the clergy throughout the earth to the fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand; but they have not heed, ed this testimony, and of them God’s prophet continues to speak thus: ‘They know not, neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are out of course.’ This is exactly the condition of the world today as foretold by the prophets and as seen by the statesmen of the world above quoted, and yet the clergy are seemingly oblivious to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Scriptures make it plain that had the clergy been faithful and told the people the meaning of these things God would have spared the nations called Christendom from the impending national disaster. For this reason the clergy stand reprehensible before God for the great trouble that is ahead.—Jeremiah 18:8,9; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">23:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Instead of heeding the words of the Lord and teaching the people the truth they turn their churches into recruiting stations and preach the boys into the trenches, and for this reason God’s prophet says to them: ‘In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.’ (Jeremiah 2:34) It was the principal ones of their flock with whom they conspired and acted to carry on the war. It is they, and the principal of their flock, who have oppressed the poor. It is they who have called themselves shepherds and who have fed themselves and let the flock starve for the hearing of the Word of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“‘Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds, Woe be to the shepherds of Israel [spiritual Israel—Christendom] that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. And they were scattered because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.’ ‘Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Therefore, says the Lord to them: TIowl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished: and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.’—Ezekiel 34:1-5,10; Jeremiah 25: 34, 35.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enterp<sup>:</sup>: ise</span><span class="font7"> is not compelled to publish the truth, but when it solicits subscriptions on the promise to publish the whole truth it is dishonest for it to then delete some of the most important parts. Such is an offence against the Lord and against his people. I therefore call on my friends to read and take heed to the words of the Apostle Paul, to wit: “Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine’ which ye have learned ; and avoid them, Eor</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.”—-Romans 16:17,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">18. . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">. r</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since that time the editor, of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enterprise, </span><span class="font7">upono the pretense, of. publishing the trtith<sub>s</sub> has appeared at the International Bible Students conventions and solicited subscriptions for his paper. I insist that his course is neither honest nor fair. Ko one can support two masters. We must be either for the Lord or against Him. This is no time for lukewarmness.

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7">FTER perusing the article in Golden Age, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No. 155, on Peru, I volunteer a little firsthand knowledge of that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the writer’s visit there I understood that the city water was piped from the interior (this was nearly twelve years ago), and that the natives speak the Spanish language, though different in dialect from the Chilean, Argentine or Brazilian Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A source of wonder in that country is that in the vicinity of Lima, whore the country knew no rain, yet the palms ten to thirty or more feet high apparently were at home and in great abundance and contrast to the soil (sand) from which they derived their nutrition. Vegetation in general derived its moisture from the extremely heavy dew that falls or did fall during the early hours of the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Silicate of soda is mined in South America much as coal is mined in our country, from drifts in the mountains. The natives are very courteous and friendly. They are of small stature and live as many as twelve in one room. They are very happy as long as they get enough to eat and “Pisca”, a cheap white whisky, to drink. This applies to the working class, with whom the standard of living is in ho way comparable to that of the white races.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No article on that country is complete without mention of the national sport (bullfighting) which is discussed and looked forward to much </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">our big league ball games-are here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Peruvian winters are just slightly cooler than our summers, yet the natives </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> around wrapped in blankets; and while the country is a never-to-be-forgotten sight to sojourners or visitors the climate soon saps the white man’s vitality and ambition. Peru has an air of fascination and idleness. It is really no &quot;wonder that those who spend any considerable time in tropic climes have no desire to return to the temperate zones. When they do it is to their own detriment, because of the vast difference in conditions and the next to impossible task of becoming reacelimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The beasts of burden in Peru are the mule and lowly donkey, drawing two-wheeled carts, chiefly with a rope harness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the West Indies, also visited by the writer, bay rum could then be bought for a shilling a quart or twenty-five cents: bananas, large bunch (seven hand), a shilling; pineapples, a penny or two cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not to be forgotten are the diving boys who row about the bays in home-made boats built from soap boxes and odds and ends. Upon the throwing of a coin into the sea by an onlooker they will dive after it, which is really some feat. If you do not think it is hard, just try it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">upekf Hughes in the Buffalo </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Courier </span><span class="font7">gives some interesting pictures of practices which have met with public approval in the two countries, Britain and America, where, of course, we Like to feel that Christianity has developed its most perfect fruitage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He cites a case in England where something over a hundred years ago a girl in her teens whose husband was shanghaied into the navy, leaving her with two babies to support, tried to steal a piece of linen but, seeing that she was watched, put it back. She was arrested and hanged for this offense, the kind-hearted Christian rulers expressing their regret that they had to do this, for an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Rhode Island in 1788 a horse-thief was given 117 lashes and his property confiscated. In the effort to get even for what he considered an unjust punishment he set fire to his cell and was thereupon branded with an “A” (for arson) on each cheek, and banished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Massachusetts in 1790 a counterfeiter was given twenty lashes, his left arm was cut off, and he was imprisoned at hard labor for two years. In Connecticut a perjurer was branded on the forehead and compelled to wear a halter for the rest of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1832 in an American prison a woman was flogged to death. Women thieves of that time were stripped to the waist and flogged in public. Overseers in prison flogged those who looked up from their work. Sailors in the United States navy were flogged long after whipping had been forbidden in both the British navy and the merchant marine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Hughes declares that in the entire history of the world there probably was never a more horrible prison than the one in use at Newgate, Connecticut, only fifty years ago. It was an abandoned copper mine into which descent was made by a ladder. There the prisoners were kept in dripping galleries, with their necks chained to the roof and their feet fastened in iron bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We select an interesting extract from Mr. Hughes’ article, much of which sounds like a history of America in 1918:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Virginia many, many women were whipped for loose conduct. Their partners ordinarily escaped with a reprimand. But the most frightful whippings were those inflicted on the most harmless of people, the Quakers. Once they whipped three women through eleven villages, carrying them from each village to the next through such cold that the blood froze on their naked backs. One of these three was a quaint little old woman of sixty who had been publicly whipped four times before, but could not reform, and now received ten cuts of a bull-whip as she was dragged through each of eleven villages with her hands tied to a cart. They whipped her again and again after that, and she sang songs of rejoicing. One gentle old man received 357 strokes of the lash and had his right ear cut off, and still would not cease to be a Quaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Hughes explains that the object of writing his article is that the general revival of the use of the whipping-post has been advocated by the president of a group of women’s clubs, and also by a prominent member of the Young Men’s Christian Association.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Some Shepherd”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(From</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE following article appeared early this year in a Swiss Roman Catholic journal under the caption “Some Shepherd”. It has been translated, and reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The curate of Littau (Canton of Lucerne), a former Catholic missionary, seems to have very peculiar notions of instilling the gospel. On Sunday before last he chastised a youth still obliged to attend Sunday school, working at the Emmenweid, by bending his fingers backward so ruthlessly and brutally, probably to force him on his knees, that the youth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> at present disabled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How does this compare with the words of Christ: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart”? And yet they claim to be followers and representatives of Christ. The “Littauers” are really not so tender-strung and used to similar brutalities at the hands of theb minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what notion of the so-called Christian culture may the natives_have gotten if this converter of heathens practised his art of jiu-jitsu on their children I Moreover, this gentleman does not seem to have left very pleasant memories at another place called Hellbuehl, on account of his special liking for boxing ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the present case too he performed some sort of confirmation, at least as far as the ceremony of smacking is concerned. The formulae spoken to it may indeed have been more “Littauer” dialect than the prescribed Latin. And in spite of the boy’s having manifestly been hurt by the violent twisting of his fingers and giving utterance to, his pain, his ears were boxed on top of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interesting.are the answers,of a few eye-witnesses to the question whether the local parson also took part in the smacking. The reply came: “No, since the reverend father is here he does not do the smacking himself any more.” This tells the tale far enough. Is it not written: “By their fruits ya shall know them” ? Many a farmer would think twice whether he could entrust the shepherd’s duties in his cow-shed to such ruffians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, having in mind that these same gentlemen occasionally stand behind the monstrance administering the blessing, covered up to their ears in their clerical robes embroidered with the Lamb of God, etc., it is. not difficult to guess who are meant by “wolves in sheepskins”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such incidents make it inopportune to reject without further consideration the “Indictment” of the International Bible Students. The most consistent attitude toward such a behavior would be a boycott of his church, by the working class at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Back to the Bible </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reply to Ministerial Criticism. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Keprinted from the Edinburgh Press)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE recent attack by an Edinburgh minister in the columns of a church magazine on the International Bible Students Association and the insinuation against the late Pastor Russell were referred to last night by Mr. J. Hemery, of the London Tabernacle, vice-president of the Association, at a large meeting in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh. Mr. J. Mackenzie, Edinburgh, who presided, said Mr. Hemery had been thirty-eight years associated with Pastor Russell, and that he is one of the foremost Bible exponents in the world today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The topic of Mr. Hemcry’s lecture was “A Standard for the People”. Mr. Hemery said he knew there were good men in the churches, but the great churches of Christendom had no light for the people in these darkest of all days. They were like the dumb dogs of which Isaiah spoke, and they did not bark to warn their masters.of danger. The great creeds of Christendom had misled the people respecting the character of God and His purposes towards His human family. The present time was the dark hour before the daylight. The time had come when God would set up His standard for the people. For more than a generation there had been a falling away in the pulpits from adherence to the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just about fifty years ago the first principles of what was known as Higher Criticism began to come over from Germany; and the ministers in Scotland, who had been a well-cared-for people, and whose interests the people of Scotland had looked after more carefully than most peoples on the earth, tumbled over each other to get that new light on the Bible, that they might at least seem to be in the forefront of those who brought fresh light to make the Bible more readable and more popular. Now not only in Scotland but all over the earth this had eaten into what was called the Christian ministry so that one would hardly find a ministry which held the Bible from beginning to end to be the Word of God. Scarcely anyone dared to stand up and say that the first three chapters of the Bible are God-inspired, that there was an actual Garden of Eden, and that the things written there actually transpired. The idea, of prophecy had gone by the board. When the children had gone to their spiritual parents for bread they had got the stones of the creeds. When they went for fish they got the serpent of Higher Criticism. Just when there was the final breaking down of the preaching of the Word of God, Russell had been sent to the succor of the people. The work begun by Russell had been going on now till it was established all over the earth, and that company of people carried as no other did the message of God to the people—Back to the Bible, back to the prophecies of God, back to the Word of God as the word of light and goodness. This work was not financed by rich people. It was carried on by people who had not money and nobody made money out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the best known ministers in Edinburgh took upon himself some little time ago to use a denominational paper to make an attack upon Pastor Russell, and on the teachings of the I. B. S. A. “I am not here,” Mr. Hemery remarked, “to go into what he said. It would be a poor way of using our time, but I do want to say this, that since 1891 I had the pleasure of knowing Pastor Russell, who was the beginner, humanly speaking, of this movement. I state on my honor, as a responsible man, that I do not believe a cleaner moral man ever walked on the face of God’s earth. His wife did seek and did get what in America is called a divorce, which in this country is called a judicial separation. There was never an absolute divorce, and his ■wife never raised a charge of immorality against him. I will tell you who it was who started that. It was the clergy; it was the preachers in America, and it is the preachers in this country who have done this. God knows how they will have to suffer for putting slanders on one of God’s most faithful servants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for making money out of this concern, Mr. Hemery said Pastor Russell died a poor man. Never a penny did Pastor Russell make out of the movement. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> had since 1901,” Mr. Hemery continued, “the privilege of handling in Great Britain all the finances of the Society, that publishes books and furnishes speakers as opportunity offers. I personally handled more than a million books in this country when Pastor Russell was alive, and I know he never got a farthing royalty or made a penny profit out of his works. He had £40 laid up for some years to cover the cost of his funeral. His wife was at his funeral service in Pittsburgh, and put a wreath on the coffin and on it was, 'To my beloved husband.’ ” Mr. Hemery, in concluding this matter, said that “as for our teachings, they are open and plain. Yonder man stated them wrongly. No Christian association at this present time is doing so much for the honor and glory of God as the I. B. S. A.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the past twenty-five years or more the I. B. S. A., the lecturer observed, had brought more men and women back to the Bible and to real consecration to God than all the organized religions put together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The Church as the Preserver of Learning</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE ■writer of the following item, now deceased, spent a lifetime in futile efforts to establish a better order of things. Rather than forsake his ideals he rejected a proposed bequest of $10,000 income per year, and lived and died to all intents and purposes a tramp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You have been told that the Church in the dark ages was the preserver of learning, the patron of science, and the friend of freedom. The preserver of learning in the dark ages! It was the Church that made these ages dark. Yes, as the worm-eaten oak chest preserves a manuscript. No more thanks to them than to the rats for not devouring its pages. It was the republics of Italy and the Saracens of Spain that preserved learning, and it was the Church that trod out the light of those Italian republics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Ernest Jones</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The patron of sciences! What? When they burned Savonarola and Bruno, imprisoned Galileo, persecuted Columbus, and mutilated Abelard. The friend of freedom! What? When they crushed the republics of the South, pressed the Netherlands like the vintage in a wine-kelter, girded Switzerland with a belt of fire and steel, banded the crowned tyrants of Europe against the reformers of Germany, and launched Claverhouse against the Covenanters of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The friend of freedom! When they edged kings with divinity. Their superstitions alone upheld the rotten fabric of oppression. Their superstitions alone turned the indignant free man into a willing slave and made men bow to the hell they created here by the hope of a heaven they could not ensure hereafter. There is nothing so corrupt that the Papacy has not befriended.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Neglect of the Bible Causes Crime</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font7">IFTY years ago the people of the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">States loved the Bible, read it, studied it and believed it; and there was little crime. The people were honest; the Bible made them so. Today the people are widely taught to ignore the Bible, to disbelieve it, and to put their faith in men. The result is inevitable. The people have lost faith in God and in the rewards that follow righteousness. Grafters flourish everywhere. Back to the Bible the people must go; for civilization is slipping into the chasm even now. It is significant that the so-called religious press sets forth as a remedy that the people must be gotten into the churches, the institutions that have backed every war that was ever fought. No. It is not more churchian-ity that the people need. It is more Christianity, the Christianity of the Lord Jesus and the apostles. Let us all get back to the Book of Books, the Word of Life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T IS a real pleasure to be once more on Staten</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">; Island. It is even a greater pleasure to tell tile people from this station on Staten Island that a time of great blessing will be their portion in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Staten Island is an historical place. It was for some time the headquarters of the noble-minded George Washington, who fought for and gained the liberties for the American people, thereby releasing them from the despotic hand of a tyrant. It now enjoys the distinction of maintaining and supporting a radio station devoted to heralding to the people a message of liberty; a message from God’s Word proclaiming to the people that God purposes to soon release mankind from the oppressive and tyrannical hand of the invisible ruler of this world. I opine that the day will come when the people of the land vail point with much satisfaction to the fact that from Staten Island came the message to them of consolation in a time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past two months it has been my privilege to visit a number of European countries and to again personally observe the needs of oppressed humanity. It would be of little profit to refer to the woes of humankind unless we know of some means of alleviation. We have this knowledge from the Word of God and it is our privilege to tell it one to another without money and without price. It is my sincere desire to be a real friend to the people. I am not seeking members in any organization or association; I am not seeking converts nor followers ; I am not seeking money nor the plaudits of men. My desire and effort is to show my friendship to the people by telling them the truth in kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some who find objection to what I say. Such are not lovers of liberty. They object because the truth exposes their errors and interferes with their selfish interests. I hold that the truth will bear the closest scrutiny, and that it always welcomes investigation. Falsehood loves darkness. Those who practise false doctrines desire to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. The truth loves light to shine forth that he who reads may run forward with gladness of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Falsehood and darkness have ever been the instruments of oppression. Love for truth and righteousness has been the inducing cause for men to fight for their liberties. My fight is not against men but against error and darkness. I have no controversy with human beings. I have a large controversy with the things that keep the people in darkness and in ignorance of their rights and privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this season the American people are celebrating their independence. How many of the present generation understand and appreciate what led to American independence? I ask my radio audience to pause and calmly consider. What was the moving cause that induced the people of the American colonies to take up arms for their liberties ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was 149 years ago that American independence was declared. After a lapse of so long a time it is easy to forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One hundred and forty-nine years ago the population of the American colonies was less than one-half of the present population of the city of New York. That little company of three million people, and their ancestors, had come up through great adversity. More than 150 years before the memorable Independence Day their ancestors had begun to seek a home in the wilds of the Western Hemisphere. And what was the moving cause ? I answer: It was a sincere desire for liberty where they might have freedom of speech and exercise the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">England had broken aw’ay from the oppressive and intolerant chains of Home and established her own national church. But soon England forgot that she had been persecuted by Rome. English Christians, who had insisted on less formality and a more simple and true worship of God, were banished to the Netherlands. These Christians were called Puritans. Having long desired to find a land where they might be secure from persecution, and where' they might enjoy the liberty of the pure and simple worship of God, a number of these Puritans set sail on wooden ships for the wilds of the unchartered earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a long and perilous voyage, buffeted by storms, and tossed by the angry waves, they landed on the bleak shores of what is now New England. It was in the dead of winter. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">storms of sleet and snow beat incessantly upon their heads. They suffered from hunger, cold and exposure. They were ravaged by disease and death until their ranks were greatly reduced. Bravely they fought on, and there laid the foundation of a great commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">England, instead of encouraging these brave souls, adopted the weather-beaten policy of intrigue, intoleration and persecution. This oppression continued from year to year until at two o’clock on July 4th, 1776, like a destructive flame belching forth from the bowels of the earth, a suppressed spirit of liberty exploded, bringing forth the Declaration of American Independence. The spirit of justice and liberty that had planted Plymouth colony had now brought forth its fruits. There the organized people gave birth to a nation destined to take the lead amongst the then nations of the earth for the rights of men. There was born a nation which should stand for a time as a sample of religious liberty, and from which land the Lord would in due time send forth the message of His kingdom, and lift up a standard around which the peoples of earth may rally, pointing them to the true way that leads to life, liberty and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nation of America was begotten in adversity and born in tribulation, and its decadence is now marked and noted by ail fair-minded men. Today the new nation of the Lord, begotten and developed amidst adversity and persecution, is now born amidst great tribulation, and it will stand forever to bless the people with life, liberty and happiness, for which they have long hoped and prayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In that memorable Declaration of Independence it was said that all men are created equal; that all have the natural right to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness; and that human governments are instituted for the sole purpose of seeking the welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The principles there declared are true; but how far short have the peoples of earth come to carrying out these principles! There is no human government today that acts upon the theory that all men are created equal, and that all have the right to liberty and happiness. There is no human government now on earth which is administered for the sole purpose of the welfare of the people. And why is this so 7 I answer: Because the spirit of intolerance, which Satan the god of this world has planted in the hearts and minds of selfish men, still controls the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently in Spain I visited an old church where the intolerance of Rome was practised upon unfortunate victims. There a court of inquisition, composed of clergymen and high churchmen, called before it in a church building, which still stands, those who refused to believe and practise the doctrines of the Roman church. These were convicted, of course, whether guilty or innocent. They were then compelled to taka the mass and immediately afterwards were led to the church yard, tied to a stake and burned alive. This is a sample of intolerance that still exists in the minds and hearts of many who would practise it if this were possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The spirit of intolerance planted by Satan in the dark ages has not been effaced. Recently from this station, in answer to a question, I spoke of some doctrines of the Catholic church, which I know to be false. I spoke not against men. because ] have no quarrel with men; I spoke only that the people might investigate for themselves, and gain greater liberty of thought. Notwithstanding the right of free speech and of freedom of religion, I have received some letters of denunciation and threats from those who claim to be Catholics. I assure my radio audience, however, that I have no quarrel with those who thus speak against me. If what I tell to the people is untrue, then let all the clergy of the land rise up and tell the people wherein it is untrue. I grant them that liberty. If the doctrines they have long taught to the people are false and misleading, then every honest man should want to know the facts. No threat nor denunciation shall deter me from telling my fellow man what I conceive to be in the interest of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Intolerance is repugnant to those who have grown up on American soil and who have any of the spirit of their ancestors left within them. Intolerance is malignant bigotry openly expressed. Those who practise it are moved by savage ferocity. The pretense of super-knowledge, power and sanctity does violence to good sense and reason and is an exhibition of folly. For men to devise, and to impose upon the credulous people, formalities, creeds and ceremonies, and to claim that these are of divine origin, is the grossest kind of fraud and intolerance. To insist or attempt to compel ths people to believe and practise meaningless and unreasonable things is to fetter the conscience, and is therefore a gross injustice. To threaten an American who dares speak the truth is the grossest kind of intolerance, and I believe that such intolerance is not pleasing to people who love truth and righteousness, regardless of whether they be Catholic or Protestant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arrogance and intolerance have spilled much innocent blood, destroyed kingdoms, overthrown empires, and brought down the righteous indignation of God upon tyrannical rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'The peoples of earth witnessed a tremendous example of this in the overthrow of the Egyptians, and the Lord indicates by His Word that He will again express His righteous indignation against the injustice and intolerance of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I ask my radio audience, as free American citizens, whether they care to support a class of men who would keep them in ignorance of their own rights and privileges before God and man, or whether they care to hear the truth and be free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">OD created man a free moral agent and gave him the liberty to choose evil and take the consequences, or to choose good and receive the blessing. Man was overreached by the Devil, led to disobedience, thereby choosing the wrong course. He lost his liberty, and all of his children were borh sinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus declared that Satan is a liar and the father of lies. The Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4 says that Satan is the god of this world; and in Ephesians 6:12 he tells us that Satan is the ruler of darkness. These and other scriptures show that it has ever been the policy of Satan and his emissaries to keep the people steeped in ignorance concerning God’s provision for their liberty and for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The formalistic creeds of the various ecclesiastical systems of the earth were not formulated by Christ Jesus, nor by Jehovah, nor by any of the faithful apostles. They emanated-from the brain of the most fertile liar, Satan. They were injected into the minds of selfish men. They have been practised by men for the purpose of keeping the people in darkness. All the time the people have desired liberty and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why, you ask, would Jehovah God then permit the practice of so much deception, sin and wickedness? The answer is, from the Scriptures, that God has permitted the human race to have this long experience of sin, oppression and darkness, that they might learn the baneful effects of a wrongful course; and that they might learn that their liberty, peace, happiness and joy come only from following the course of righteousness outlined in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah organized Israel into a nation. He permitted that people for a long time to reside in Egypt. He permitted them to be oppressed under Pharaoh, who was arrogant, selfish, intolerant and wicked. He sent Moses to be their deliverer. Moses peaceably asked Pharaoh to let God’s people go. Pharaoh arrogantly refused, and defied Jehovah. Then the Lord led His people peaceably out of Egypt; and when Pharaoh and his host pursued them God’s wrath came down upon them and destroyed all the Egyptians and their ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures show that this foreshadows God’s indignation to be expressed on a far greater scale. Pharaoh is a type of Satan, the Devil, who is the god of this world. Egypt was a type of the whole earth; the people of Israel a type of the peoples of the whole earth, who desire liberty and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord declared that in the end of this age, where we now are, He will express His indignation against the unrighteous one and deliver His people, the peoples of earth; and that in doing so He will bind Satan and so completely restrain him that he can deceive the nations no more.—Revelation 20:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This and other scriptures show that darkness and falsehood have been the methods employed to keep the people away from the Lord and away from righteousness. It follows then that when the people know the truth and embrace it this will be their method of obtaining their freedom. God has provided through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus for the release of the human race from the bondage and slavery of sin and death, and ignorance and superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As recorded in John 8: 31, 32 Jesus said: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Satan is the prince of darkness it is to be expected that he would want to keep the people in ignorance. This he does through his various emissaries.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">leads to light, life and liberty. He is the great Prince of Peace. He is the great antitypical Moses, and the great Deliverer of the peoples into light, life and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Israel were God’s chosen people and a typical people. God gave to them a code of perfect laws. Among these law’s was the law of the jubilee. It required every fiftieth year to be celebrated by the people as a jubilee. In that year every man in bondage must be given his liberty. Every one w'ho had lost his property must have it restored to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Paul in Hebrews 10:1 tells us that the things.of the law foreshadowed better things to come; therefore we understand the law of the jubilee to foreshadow’ the coming liberty of the peoples of the earth. The rule is that the type is repeated until the coining of the antitype. The law’ here mentioned required seventy jubilees to be kept, one every fiftieth year. That •would cover a period of 3500 years. The jubilee began to count B. C. 1575. From that time 3500 years added brings us to the end of 1925. What then should we expect! The beginning of the antitypical jubilee, the first part of which is to sound the jubilee trumpet proclaiming liberty to the people. The law reads: “And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, ye shall return every man unto his family.”—Leviticus 25:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore the time has come for the peoples of earth to know the truth. If the doctrines the clergy have been teaching the people are true they will bear the closest examination and scrutiny and the clergy should not object when another man examines them. If their doctrines are false they are bound to fall. If the clergy do not believe the Bible let them say so and cease claiming to be its advocates. If they do believe the Bible then let them come forth and prove what they say is true and thereby justify themselves, or else let them acknowledge that they are wrong. The truth is God’s. It belongs to no man. What the people need is the truth in order to bring them their liberty. The time has come for them to receive the truth. The flood of truth has begun to rise, and no power on earth can stop it. Let everyone take notice of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font7">ROM the beginning of governments, the rank and file of the people suffered indignities. They were oppressed by tyrants and the weaker were robbed by the stronger. During all that time they had. a desire for relief and it was hoped by many peoples of the earth that the Anlerican Revolution meant a better period for mankind everywhere. At the birth of the American nation it was declared that all men have the natural right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that human governments are instituted for the sole purpose of seeking the ■welfare of the people. Such is a beautiful and idealistic statement of truths. It properly expresses the desire of man. While some benefit resulted, nothing compared with man’s hopes have resulted. A century and a half of laborious effort on the part of the people has failed to bring a realization of these great ideals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now we find all the nations of the earth in a state of fear and perplexity. They fear for their property interests, their rights and their liberty. Shall all the peoples of earth abandon hope of some day enjoying life, liberty and happiness? If man was compelled to rely on his own efforts and ability he would never realize these great ideals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another great crisis has come; and in this man will begin to realize his extremity and then will turn his attention to God’s great remedy. Under the righteous reign of Christ the Messiah the obedient ones will realize far more than their fondest desires or hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now we see the nations of earth in a state of decay. The Scriptures, and the extraneous eyi dences, prove beyond a doubt that the end ( the world has been reached and that the time for the setting up of the Lord’s kingdom is here. Jehovah, through His prophet Daniel, referring to this time of distress and perplexity upon earth, said in Daniel 2: 44; “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the birth of this new nation, the great kingdom of Messiah, the kingdom of righteousness, the people will look up and lift up their heads, because it means their deliverance. They will then learn that the kingdom of the Lord is iildeed a government that is established and exercised for the welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">j ; Looking down to the time of Messiah’s reign, God’s prophet Isaiah in chapter 9:6,7, said: “The government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called ..Wonderful, Counsellor,; the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">his government and peace there shall be no end.” Everlasting Father means giver of everlasting life, and to the obedient ones He will grant life everlasting. Prince of Peace means that His government will be one of peace, that He is the Prince of all peace, that He will establish forever peace amongst the peoples of earth, and that He will grant unto them, and each one of them the liberty to do right; and the result will be that they will dwell together in righteousness and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Prophet Micah, referring to the same time, declares in Micah 4:3-5: “And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his tig tree: and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be then that the spirit of fear is removed from the hearts and minds of the people. They shall fear neither landlords nor profiteers, false teachers, or false representatives of their interests, because they will know that all their interests and welfare are safeguarded by the great King of kings and Lord of lords, who shall rule in righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">kingdom, and that they shall reign with Him. —Romans 8:16,17; Revelation 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">““Before the foundation of the world God had foreordained that He would have a kingdom and a royal family who would have charge of the kingdom. The kingdom necessarily embraces the royal house, or royal family, as well as the dominion. Foreknowing the end of all things, God provided in His great plan not only for the redemption of the human race, but for tho selection from amongst men of a certain number whom He would transform into the imago and likeness of His beloved Son. God provided also that these should constitute the royal family of heaven. The Apostle Peter says of this class: “But you are a chosen race, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a purpose; that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light; who once were not a people, but now ar© God’s people.”—1 Peter 2: 9,10. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">*<sup>62</sup>Some have misconstrued this scripture to mean that the Lord would appear the second time and give a great shout and wake up the dead. The word here translated shout means a message of encouragement. It implies a public message designed for the ears not of a few, but for a great number. The “shout”, the “voice of the archangel” and the “trump of God” are all symbols. Literally, the scripture means that the appearing of the Lord will be at the time of or.during a shout of encouragement; and this is in full harmony with the evidences heretofore examined that the presence of the Lord has been at a time when the people have been encouraged concerning their own rights. Christians have encouraged one another by passing the message of the Lord’s presence on to each other. The peoples have encouraged one another with reference to their liberties, rights, and privileges. The “voice of the archangel”, as used in this passage, means one with authority, the chief messenger, Christ Jesus himself. He comes with light and truth, illuminating the minds of men, leading them into greater light, which has come upon the end of the age when the shout of encouragement for the rights and liberties of the people and for the deliverance of Christians into the kingdom of the Lord has begun throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘“During tills time, then, we should expect the resurrection of those saintly ones who died before the second coming of the Lord; and should expect that these would be awakened out of death and gathered unto the Lord, thus to be forever with Him. And therefore those believers who were alive at His coming, when the time came for their death would experience an instantaneous change from human to spirit beings. And finally, when all the members of the bride class shall have finished their course and all have passed from the human into the spiritual condition, with glorious bodies, they will enjoy peace and happiness for evermore. The Lord is taking unto himself His bride class, because the promise is that these shall be heirs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">God and joint heirs with Christ Jesus in His</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">By. </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">vote of seven to six the Argentine Coun</span><span class="font6">cil </span><span class="font7">of Ministers has decided to discontinue any appropriations for the maintenance o</span><span class="font6">f an em</span><span class="font7">bassy to the Vatican. This action follows similar action by the French government within the past few weeks. Only a brief tinie ago the Argentine government served notice on the Vatican that its representative was unwelcome in Argentina, owing to interference in domestic political affairs.</span></p>

General Svyuinton said : &quot;'^ehe great future weapon of war will be deadly germs. \Ve have, since the war, discovered and developed germs which, dropped upon cities and arniies, will slaughter </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">nation in </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">day.&quot; •</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">seven-month perioa the United States Government paid out to two British lines </span><span class="font6">$401,000 </span><span class="font7">for mail assigned to those vessels to carry-abroad for the United States' postal administra-' tion; but in that same time twelve of Uncle Sam's best ships- headed in the other direction received a total of less than </span><span class="font6">$5,000, </span><span class="font7">four of them nothing at all. The Government is now making </span><span class="font6">an </span><span class="font7">inquiry into- this, with a view of seeing whether fair play cannot be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thrteen villages and parishes have disappeared from the East Riding of Yorkshire within </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">few hundred years last past. In one place </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">forest lies dromred. In another place the records show that certain men were excom</span><span class="font6">municated </span><span class="font7">for poaching where fishes now live. </span><span class="font6">On </span><span class="font7">the rocky Jersey shore there is a tower which was built in the time of Napoleon, bl1t which after less </span><span class="font6">than 120 </span><span class="font7">years is now nearly two miles out at sC'a.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three women, spiritualists, took pictures of London's Cenotaph which, when developed, showed photographs of faces dirnly revealed about the top of the monument. Accused of fraud, the woman explained that these photographic results &quot;come from some power which works through me, and over which I have no control.&quot; We accept this as correct. The </span><span class="font6">pO'w-</span><span class="font7">ers are demoniacal. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the death of a ten-year-old patient at Gloucester, Dr. IIadwen, the world's most fa-</span><span class="font6">IUOUS </span><span class="font7">anti-vivisectionist and anti-vaccinationist, ,vas arrested, charged with manslaughter, because he had failed to adnlinister antit.oxin. During the course of the trial, which lasted </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">week, Dr. Hadwen when asked why he did not follow the general view of his fello'w physicians retorted that at one time the whole medical profession were in favor of bleeding. When asked why </span><span class="font6">he </span><span class="font7">set up. his judgment </span><span class="font4">as </span><span class="font7">against that of </span><span class="font6">all </span><span class="font7">the other doctors, he answered by the one word Galileo. When the jury, after twenty minutes deliberation, brought in a verdict of Not Guilty, Dr. Hadwen received one of the greatest demonstrations ever witnessed in England. &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty million dead rats are the results of </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">week's campaign recently waged in Great Britain. It was calculated that about seventy percent of the baits fixed found victims. </span><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font7">form of poison was used called red squill, which has the peculiar property of killing rats </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font7">be</span><span class="font6">ing </span><span class="font7">harmless to domestic animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Possibly influenced more or less by the Ku Klux Klan movement, - England has under way a fiery cross crusade. A cross made up of burning lamps is - being taken around from one church building to another. Squads of men watch the lamps to - see that they do not go out. It makes quite an exciting time for the small boys, who wonder, as do those of more mature years, what it is all about and what good it can possibly do. The clergy are reported as saying that they are deteITllined by this means to get a fresh outpouring of the holy spirit. We do not remember that the early&quot;&quot; church ever engaged in such </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">crusade, -but they had the holy spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A ‘ CATHOLIC lady, Agnes Casement </span><span class="font6">Nmvd </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font7"> man, writing in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> de;-clares that &quot;at the present time Southern Ireland (outside .the six counties of Ulster) is groaning under a cruel and shameful, taxation; yet almost every week Free State Ministers are being banqueted at great expense, while their own countrywen are at their doors in a state of appalling starvation! Old men, women and children are the greatest sufferers. Thieving is rampant in Dublin streets. Railway </span><span class="font6">rates </span><span class="font7">have been raised </span><span class="font6">100 </span><span class="font7">percent since </span><span class="font6">1922. </span><span class="font7">Clothing and food are nlore expensive in many parts than in the United States.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Declaring that King Alfonso, during the World War, repeatedly conveyed to Berlin in.. formation which he thought might help the German cause, the novelist Ibanez says of Spain's present condition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Reading a Spanish newspaper is simply reading lit</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font5">erature by Primo de Rivera, a fantastic author and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11 </span><span class="font5">tragic clown. Throughout the nineteenth century no Western European country was in a situation like that of Spain today. Only Russia under the Czars in </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">most troubled times could offer such a spectacle of cruel, illiterate, grotesque generals enslaving the </span><span class="font6">entire </span><span class="font5">country and killing its thought.

In wheeled chairs, on stretchers, or carried by relatives, or led. by their children, came the armless, the leg</span><span class="font6">less, the </span><span class="font7">blind, and </span><span class="font6">those whose </span><span class="font7">faces had </span><span class="font6">been </span><span class="font7">destroyed by shrapnel. No such spectacle was ever seen on earth before, and God forbid it nlay ever be again. The parade was an appeal for pension enough to sustain life. By a new rule Americans: born in France are liable to serve in the French army. General Pershing's Commission has decided that the 30,447 graves of American soldiers in France shall be marked with marble crosses instead of headstones, as in America.</span></p>

According to 1'lr. Chautenlps fifteen hundred young men in one district have formed a legion, and have taken an oath to obey the priest before the laws; and </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font7">other parts of the republic bishops and priests are inciting the people to bloodshed, in resistance of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The French government has passed a law forbidding religious processions, similar to the 1[exican law on the same subject. The' Bishop of 110ntauban tried a test case. Dressed up in all the paraphernalia that goes with the Bishop business, he headed a funeral procession for the cemetery. But the police, 'meant business; and when he neared the entrance . they forcibly removed his black skirt. Then a fist fight followed, during which three were arrested.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE reason 'why ‘ve hear so little any more about the Far Eastern Republic is that it has ceased to exist.

The father of our country was not a college graduate; Andrew Jackson had almost no education; and Abra </span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font6">ham Lincoln acquired most of his education after he had left school. Interest in this is inten-sHIed when we recall that Mr. Lincoln, who was not a soldier, won the war against Gen. Lee, one of the ablest men in the annals of American generalship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE </span><span class="font6">groundwork of an intelligent and wisely ordered society begins in the home. The child that is there taught to regard constituted authority, and that by the aid of normally well-educated parents. receives a ,veIl-balanced start in life, is more than half prepared to regard the &quot;velfare of the people in general in later years. If there could be a sincere and mutual cooperation between worthy parents, the teachers. in our schools, and the leaders of state, with a keen desire to teach our children to think, then the ties that bind the interests of the people ''lould be kind instead of cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proper kind of education is a better s afe</span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font6">guard of liberty than </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">standing army. To distribute equally and impartially intellectual powers is of far greater importance than is the dividing of things material, and less dangerous to society; but this our great leaders have steadfastly refused to concede.

<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font7">ECENTLY </span><span class="font6">Dr. Ifeiklejohn, late of Amherst, made some startling remarks. in proof of the foregoing. As. quoted by the. “Literary Digest&quot; and the &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, he is reported to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;But in many external ways the American college, has confused its g</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font5">ad</span><span class="font4">u</span><span class="font5">ates</span><span class="font6">. </span><span class="font5">Not only has it asked </span><span class="font6">for </span><span class="font5">help; it has sought for favor. </span><span class="font6">Often, </span><span class="font5">and in </span><span class="font4">mallY </span><span class="font5">ways quite unworthy of itself, it has appealed to </span><span class="font6">selfish </span><span class="font5">and silly l</span><span class="font6">o</span><span class="font4">y</span><span class="font5">alt</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font5">es, to provincial and stupid prejudices; </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">for this we have had </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">pay. </span><span class="font6">'Ve </span><span class="font5">who are in charge of learning have often craved the favor of men </span><span class="font4">who </span><span class="font5">do not ca</span><span class="font4">r</span><span class="font5">e for learning, and the re</span><span class="font4">s</span><span class="font5">ult </span><span class="font4">is </span><span class="font5">that at </span><span class="font4">times </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font4">s</span><span class="font5">tr</span><span class="font4">ai</span><span class="font5">n of lab o</span><span class="font4">r </span><span class="font5">under the hostile </span><span class="font4">scrutiny </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font6">'thou</span><span class="font5">sands of angry, uncomprehending eyes </span><span class="font6">becomes almost </span><span class="font5">unbearable.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A few days later this. same editor said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Professors know that they embarrass </span><span class="font4">their </span><span class="font6">presi</span><span class="font5">dents </span><span class="font6">aud they embarrass the financial condition of their </span><span class="font5">college wnen they give </span><span class="font6">themselves </span><span class="font5">over to free-thinking, especially when such free-thinking and free-speaking happen to </span><span class="font6">be </span><span class="font5">contrary to </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">class which makes the big contributions.... And the fact is that Harvard, like, other endowed colleges, depends largely for financial support upon the voluntary contributions of rich men, who are 'perfectly satisfied with the present conditions and who have made their money largely out of conditions which ■ most forward-looking people think ought to be corrected.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not long since, Harvard announced that it would teach men to think, which, says Mr. ■ Brisbane, &quot;recalls the saying, You can lead a horse to water, but&quot;—. Our college boards must know that untrammeled education and helpful, constructive thinking have contributed more to the welfare of society than has passive and gullible acquiescence for the sake of mere policy or filthy lucre. A sm</span><span class="font9">af</span><span class="font6">l fire that warms is hetter by far than </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">large one that burns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fathers of our country were all once considered irrational; and respectable English-gen-tlenlen brooked no denial -of their sore displeasure at being outwitted. Similarly in our time there is vehemence breathed out agaI<sup>.</sup> nst any one who would give the people the power to think, and while statesmen realize that we </span><span class="font0">-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">must have education, still they wink at a system that dexterously arranges that nothing inimical to &quot;big interests&quot; shall be taught to, our rising generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But despite this deliberate handicap, the people are awakening to the situation; and </span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font6">he leaders must soon acknowledge the sovereign will of the people as superior to classi interests. Only they must learn that pent-up steam, now released, may not run the machine so smoothly as if it had been used gradually. Iconoclasm and t</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font6">inking play their parts alternatively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Three Points for Consideration</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font6">ECENTLY a very prominent business man gave . as his key to success three points to keep in mind. They were: To remember, to observe, and to compare. Those who wish to check up on their Americanism might go at it in a similar manner: First, memorize the underlying principles of the Constitution; then dare to live in harmony with them; and re-n1ember that this wonderful document was framed in about eighty-five working days by men who, for the most part, were considered by the English as back-woodsmen and novices—-a piece of work so quickly and well done that it elicited the praise of England's grand old man, Mr. Gladstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now contrast this masterpiece and its meaning -with the present-day interlocking machinery composed of boards, auxiliaries; committees, etc., with modern facilities for rapid work who spend months in trying to interpret (?) our Constitution and put a few patches on state and national statutes. It is as though one could hope .to beautify </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">silken garment by sewing on many cotton frills. One might honestly inquire why our government personnel in executive, judiyial, and legislative capacity are for the most part the product of much college education; and why, when one arises to official prorl1-inence from the common ranks, he is regarded as a huge joke! It is well known that many of those who withhold their votes at the various elections, local to national, are the ones who think. ' They love the principles of </span><span class="font0">&lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">righteousness and justice, but find little or no opportunity to express their desires at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another point of interest here is that real genius is not always the offspring of ancestr</span><span class="font9">al </span><span class="font6">brilliancy. 1iany a man who has boasted of hIS family tree in the field of education later hanged himself on that tree. While genius is born more often than created, still it usually arises out of conditions and environs that are consi.;, dered common and ordinary. But one great error in our system is to disregard the things of conllllonplace, whereas the truly learned and cultured would consider equally things of high estate and low. Only the mediocre mind would condemn a thing because it is numble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Paul said (Romans 12: 16)-: &quot;Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.&quot; The truly great mind scorns nothing, pe it ever so humble^ for he realizes that few men of unusual i</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font6">telligence have left the imprint of their ability upon their children, especially to any noticeable degree. Thus further is attested that one cannot always endow another with talent even when that one is of one's own blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even the commendable feat of memorizing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6"> not of itself essential </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6"> thinking. The so-called memory tests, although good, are not always a criterion. One might memorize </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font6">great length a certain line of argument and </span><span class="font4">re</span><span class="font6">cite it by the yard; but who wishes to be a parrot ? The famous French writer, Montesquieu, once said: &quot;I write not that you may read, but that you may think.&quot; This same author again said: &quot;One who talks without thinking resembles a hunter who shoots without aiming.&quot; Socrates showed where true thinking begins when he said that he was called the wises</span><span class="font4">t </span><span class="font6">of Greeks because he knew that he knew nothing,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Knowledge humbles the great man, astonishes the common, man, and swells the little man. Instead of blushing with a sense of unwarranted shame and fear when confronted with the proverbial interrogation, &quot;What do you know?&quot; the young mind should be taught the dignity and import of the question, “What do you think f' The so-called smart set should know that real ability to think begins vlhere boasting of knowledge ends. ,\Ve are never </span><span class="font4">111 </span><span class="font6">ore deceived than, when we nlistake bigness for greatness, orthodoxy and tradition for truth, and pomposity for erudition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proper use of education is not so much ' to teach one how to absorb the ideas of another, as to train him how to apply his own mind. This, and not the over-stuffed intellect, is the object of education. And while few men of our time possess the ability to teach, still we can induce men to think for themselves, independently, so that instead of being enslaved to the opinions of our idolized authors and leaders, </span><span class="font4">we </span><span class="font6">should all be philosophers, capable of seeing </span><span class="font4">as </span><span class="font6">clearly as they the rationale of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An earnest, prayerful session of study with the &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, setting forth the d1vine plan regar:ding the welfare of the ppoples and nations, is worth more than ten years in some of our colleges. &quot;It is written in the prophets, And they </span><span class="font4">s</span><span class="font6">hall all be taught of God.&quot;-John </span><span class="font7">6: </span><span class="font6">45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. </span><span class="font6">Goodenough By Willard Price</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">H</span><span class="font7">E </span><span class="font6">IS more dangerous to society than any anarchist, sare-blower, or gunnlan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conlpared with him, a professional assassin is a person of the most modest criluinal accmn-plishnients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And yet this knave of WhOlU </span><span class="font7">I </span><span class="font6">speak considers hinlself an eminently respectable and desirahle citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1\;1r. Goodenough is satisfied with himself as well as with everything about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Goodenough stands pat. VVhat was good enough for his ancestors is good enough for him. He squats corpulently in the path of civilization. Those who would move on must climb over his gouty fonu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the crown of his hat to the sole of his shoe he is saturated with that dubious virtue, Content. His whole person breathes a mighty self-satisfaction. Of him it is written: &quot;When a man gets perfectly c<sub>-</sub> ontented, he and a clam are first cousins.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was that sage humorist, Josh Billings, who said: &quot;What we want is folks who won't be contented, who can't be contented, who </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">get' </span><span class="font6">up in the morning not simply to have their bed made, but for the sake of getting tired.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wl </span><span class="font4">r. </span><span class="font6">Goodenough. speaks reverently or the &quot;good old days&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In pohtics, he says: &quot;Don't fool with those new-fangled machinations of the devil—referen-durn, initiative, recall, direct prilnaries, commission govennnent. Fads, unconstitutional ■ fads! The .government that suited Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln is good enough for me!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Ah, iny friend,&quot; wags on Mr. Goodenough,. &quot;let us not tamper with the Divine plan I Brown-ing'was not mistaken when he wrote,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'God's in His Heaven, All's right with the vvorld!' </span><span class="font4">'!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, with specious argulnent, ,];11'. Goodenough makes the eager ones feel guilty and ashamed of their eagerness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The influence of the radical is less to be feared than that of the man who is satisfied. The radical is a spur in the flank. The satisfied man is </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">chloroform-soaked rag over the racer's, nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Humanity would not go fast </span><span class="font4">or </span><span class="font6">f</span><span class="font4">ar </span><span class="font6">if ,\ye ,\vere all to adopt the motto:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Such pernicious laws give to the legalized school </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">right and privilege </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font7">y</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font6">g </span><span class="font7">to the patient, You must accept the treatment we give, or you </span><span class="font4">shall have </span><span class="font7">no</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font4">e aL </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> 1l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These la,vs discriminate against certain schools of healing, while favoring- and upholding others, denying the right of the individual</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to serve the sick or well, who desire his services, toward. the recovery or maintenance of health and are, therefore, -class legislation. They also discriminate against the sick person -or the parent of the sick child, in favor of one privi-' leged school. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">State and - municipal Health Boards have been instituted throughout the land and their members are supplied almost exclusively from the . ranks of one particular school of medicine. . The public is taxed for the support of medical schools, medical boards and bureaus, and medical officials of many kinds. The regulations ' of these Health Boards are enforced by means of - the police' . powers - of the state, and often to the detriment of the health- of both the individual and the coni-. niunity, in restraint of legitimate commerce, and in defiance of the rights of the people of such com</span><span class="font6">m</span><span class="font7">unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Laws are passed prohibiting the - entrance of children -into the public schools' until they have had their blood and tissues contaminated by the introduction therein of vile pus taken .from suppurating sores on sick animals, on pretense of protecting such children ' from disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The introduction of such pus into- the bodies of children not only does not prevent the disease for'which it is administered, as is amply .demonstrated by official statistics from every country that has enforced the practice, but does often cause and spread the disease; while, according to- authoritative statements contained in the textbook of those who are advocates of this practice, and attested by many thousands of well authenticated cases, it does produce arid result in pain, fever,- infiammation, suppuration, skin eruptions, sickness and often septiceniia, cellulitis, sloughing, erysipelas, syphilis, tuberculosis and other diseases, and, neither last nor least, it </span><span class="font6">often </span><span class="font7">results in the loss of </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">limb, or even of life itself, or it 'is often followed by tumors and cancers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many of our cities laws exist whereby the local - Health Boards. declare an epidemic </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">exist, when only a few cases of some disease are -reported, and then enforce this blood contamination upon everyone, often threatening • </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">close- business houses, factories, mines - and work shops, unless ' </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">.vicious practice is- submitted • to. ' This </span><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font7">true not only as to -vaccination </span><span class="font6">for-</span><span class="font7">smallpox, but in diphtheria; and this practice is coming to be more and more -resorted -</span><span class="font6">to 1 </span><span class="font4">n </span><span class="font7">other- diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since -under the present theories almost- every disease is thought to be caused by a, germ, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">is thought to be - communicable C though these theories have been, and can be, proven absolutely without foundation in fact) </span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font7">a serum </span><span class="font4">or </span><span class="font7">vaccine' is sought with which to. prevent </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">cure each disease, the tendency is to seek more power'to' enforce - the vaccination and inocnla-. Hon of all persons, of all ages and conditions, for' each and every disease. The ultimate result of such wholesale blood pollution cannot be but annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. The - Army and . - Navy is completely under the control of ..one 'school of healing, members of all other schools, though licensed to practice, -being - denied places on the - medical'.staffs. The superstitions of vaccination and inoculation are forced upon all men aiid women in the service of - the Army and Navy, even in violation </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">their conscientious and religious -convictions. lien in the Army and Navy are forced, ' against their wills, to. undergo' dangerous operations at the behest of the doctor. Enlisted men in any branch of the service are sentenced to long prison 'terms, even as high as ten -years, fot refusing to be vaccinated or inoculated, or- for refusing to undergo an operation. • The trial </span><span class="font6">of; ' </span><span class="font7">him who - refuses an operation often 'taking place after his - recovery, has demonstrated that the operation, possibly </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">dangerous one, was unnecessary. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Law abiding citizens, in good health and engaged in the peaceful pursuit </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">their vocations, are caught up, - examined and declared </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">be &quot;disease carriers”. They are then forcibly taken - froni their families, business, and occupations and isolated where they are forced </span><span class="font4">to </span><span class="font7">undergo -treatment. Their right to the physician of their choice, at such times, </span><span class="font6">is. </span><span class="font7">also denied them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Medical examinations of school children are carried out, often withoutthe knowledge or consent of the parents, and parents are intimidated into having their children -treated- .or operated on by the orders sent home </span><span class="font6">by the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In -many of the cities-'in’-the - </span><span class="font6">United </span><span class="font7">States, i£ a case- of small-pox, _ </span><span class="font4">or. </span><span class="font7">other -..so-called- contagious disease, is reported, the Board of Health, with the aid -of the Police Department,- sets - </span><span class="font4">an </span><span class="font7">arbitrary boundary around the -locality - in </span><span class="font6">which the </span><span class="font7">case exists, stretches ropes around this </span><span class="font6">1o-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7"> In factories, mines and workshops, in many departments of the Civil Service, and in many . branches of public service employees and of:.-</span><span class="font4">i </span><span class="font7">ficials are required to have their blood and tis-• sues contaminated with vile pus collected from : the' festering sores of a sick cow, before they are permitted to assume their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many cities regulations are enforced requiring all milk sold in the city to be first suh-Initted to a high degree of heat, on the pretext of preventing disease. The niilk is thereby . vitiated, its chemistry changed, it is denatured and no longer fit for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Valuable animals have been ruthlessly and neednessly slaughtered, thereby causing great loss to stock owners ;and both human beings, food </span><span class="font6">stuff, </span><span class="font7">and even automobiles, have been put under quarantine because of some disease confined to cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In nlany cities, inorganic iodine, a well known poison, has been used to pollute the public water supply, by order of the Board of I-Iealth, </span><span class="font4">on </span><span class="font7">the absurd pretext of preventing goitre. Not only is the pollution of the public water supply a dir(jct violation of all the cardinal laws of hygiene and sanitation, and a crime against the public ,velfare, but the practice, if allowed to continue unchecked, will be extended to other drugs and other diseases, to the inevitable detriment of the puhlic health. It is a rank injustice to the individual and to the community, the well and the sick alike, to compel them to undergo indiscriminate drugging in this manner, and this all ,vithout a proper inquiry into their condition-with no proper exaniination of the patient and no diagnosis of his case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such laws, regulations and institutions are aesigned not only to fasten upon the people certain medical theories and practices, which a great majority of an enlightened public have outgrown and repudiated, but to deny to this enlightened public the right to employ </span><span class="font6">such </span><span class="font7">methods and practices as^ its reason and corn-mon sense deem best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such laws assume that a nlan can do no hanu if he holds a medical diploma and a state license; while, if he does not possess these documents and privileges, he just naturally must be wrong, ignorant and dangerous, no matter what his education, training, lllethods or results may be. It enthrones one school of medicine, representing a very small percentage of the citizenry of this nation, above all other citizens as a supreme authority over all matters of life, health, disease, cure or death of the common people; and, by throttling all other schools, stands • as an effectual bar to progress and increase of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such la,vs deprive a man and his children of their right of self-ownership, and forcibly subject them, as • mere slaves, to treatment and medication that they do not desire, and often do not need; while just as forcibly withholding from them the treatment and assistance they do desire and need. The subversion ‘of the rights of self-ownership of a man's body in matters of health, treatment, and medication, by any profession, association, public officer, or private citizen; any and all appropriations of public money to force and fasten the theories and practices of any school of healing upon the individual, community or state; the medi-calization of our public schools ; the foreing of people to go to hospitals against their wills, where dangerous experiments are performed that often cause death, or make them invalids for life ; the quarantine of healthy persons on medical suspicion; compulsory vaccination and inoculation; operations and medical inspections, whether performed on private citizens, soldiers, sailors, or pubijc officers, are unjust and tyrannical, contrary to our form of government, and a menace to our country and all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The physician is only a citizen. He has no other constitutional rights than those of other citizens. Neither is he appointed or anointed of God to rule over his fellowmen in matters of health and disease; and since humanity has always made its greatest progress under differences of opinion and constructive commerciai, educational, and scientific competition; and, since physicians of no school are infallible, and no </span><span class="font6">system of medicine </span><span class="font7">is perfect; and, since no school has' </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">monopoly ■ on truth, knowledge,. . moral integrity, and sincerity of purpose; and . since some of the most damnable impositions and damaging practices and some of the basest deceits ever perpetrated upon the people or the public, have ■ emanated from medical sources, under the protection of legalized medicine, the existing' medical institutions, daws, and regulations represent some ' of the craftiest pieces of pure class legislation that ever . existed; creating a medical trust, with a monopoly of, and exercising an autocratic control over the life and health of the people; and forcing, by unjust laws, the judgment of </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">small minority . upon the great majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the cloak of public service, public safety, and public health, such' laws and institutions fix absolutely and irrevocably the ' channels through which all money expended to secure relief from disease and 'protect the public health, must' be paid out; forcing the public to contribute millions of dollars for worthless and dangerous preparations; thereby filling the coffers of the drug and serum ■ interests; while making a criminal of the man who seeks, 'with reason and common sense, to stem the tide of this destructive stream of poison pus, and diseased animal seruuis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Patients are not permitted, if taken to public hospitals, to continue to be served by the physician of their choice, even though such physician is licensed to' practice in that state, unless he be a member of the present privileged school of medicine; but they must submit to the ministrations of a physician whose service, under existing laws and conditions, is forced upon thein. VVhy in this land of' freedom should certain reputable practitioners of the healing art be denied the right of admission to all public hospitals, and other public institutions, upon equal terms and accorded the same rights and privileges as are nGw granted and permitted to </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">favored class </span><span class="font6">1 </span><span class="font7">On what grounds are certain ones entitled to these special rights and privileges 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore, we, as peaceful and law-abiding citizens of these United ' States, do rightfully'- and justly hold that ours is the right to accept or reject ^ny physician or method. as fully and as freely as we now accept or reject the priest or preacher; .that our right to medical liberty, </span><span class="font6">and to the </span><span class="font7">care and control of our own </span><span class="font6">bodies, </span><span class="font7">is no less valuable ana. sacrea. than our • right to religious liberty, and the ' right to ' care for and control our own souls; and &quot;\ve do hereby and hereon petition our Congress, and the several States of this Union, to recognize and affirm— these rights by the proper and immediate enactment of the appended proposed amendment to our Federal Constitution.</span></p>

Mucus accumulates especially in the- heating channel (stomach and bowels) of this tube machine, ' and slowly clogs up the channel and filters (glands). The sum totaY of this defilement causes chronic effects, makes one grow old,_ and is the main factor in the nature of </span><span class="font6">aal </span><span class="font5">dise&amp;ses. Growing old, therefore, is a ' latent disease; i. e., a slow, but constantly increasing - disturbance in the operation of the motor - of life. . . </span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The ‘white corpse-like </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">coIot</span><span class="font5"> of the 'lightless and sunless man of culture can not be called beautiful, and emanates mainly from the - corpse-like color of the dead-boiled, wrong food. What wonderful color </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font5"> man gets who feeds on 'bleeding' grapes, cherries and oranges,-and who takes systematically air and sun baths, can </span><span class="font6">not </span><span class="font5">be imagined by the modern artist of 'plenair' painting.

Mucusless food —fruit and vegetables— occupy the first 'place as </span><span class="font4">re</span><span class="font5">gards their content </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">necessary mineral matter, especially lime.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Perhaps ' this corpse-like mucus </span><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font5">even the cause of the paleness ' of the white race; </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">perhaps in an - entirely healthy condition, the so-called mucus membrane should not be white and slimy, but clean and red, as </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font5">animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;On the basis of my detection </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font5">this mucus, coming from cultured food, is the fundamental cause and main factor in the nature of all diseases, symptoms of age, obesity, falling out of the hair, etc., there is </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">justified hope for the creation of a new- phase of development of .progressive healing methods and biological medicine....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;If nourishment by mucus and over-eating is the the fundamental cause of all disease- without exception ' (which I can prove to anyone on his own body), then there can exist but Qne natural remedy; i. e., fasting and fruit diet. ' That every animal fasts in case ' </span><span class="font6">of- </span><span class="font5">the slightest uneasiness - is a well-known fact. In spite of their having lost, to an extent, thanks to unnatural feeding by men, their sharp instinct for the right kind of food and natural hours of feeding, and therewith their proper state of health and acuteness of sense, they will, nevertheless, when sick, accept only the most necessary food, or </span><span class="font6">will </span><span class="font5">fast themselves. back into - </span><span class="font6">health, </span><span class="font5">Poor, sick man, however, must in no circumstances live. on short rations for more than one or two days, for fear that he may 'lose strength'.&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6"> AM woiidering how many of your readers have been giving </span><span class="font7">thought to </span><span class="font6">the question as to \vhere art, music, and literature will find <sub>;</sub> thmnsclves when the Messianic kingdom has fully arrived. Especially should it concern </span><span class="font7">those </span><span class="font6">of your readers who are particularly interested in ■ one or more of these subjects; and no doubt the' majority of them are, if not all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Literature, such </span><span class="font4">as </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">Bible, needs </span><span class="font7">no </span><span class="font6">com-n1cnt ; for it is the SOUTce of light in a dark world. </span><span class="font7">Music </span><span class="font6">of the best, </span><span class="font7">when </span><span class="font6">disassociated with thoughts pertaining to the Deceiver, needs no discussion; and art of the purest kind must be in the saino class. But there </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font6">some ' other phases of which to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely any passages of literature, parts of opera, or works of art </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font6">have a tendency to magnify the power of evil will have to go </span><span class="font7">when </span><span class="font6">the Golden Age shall have fully arrived. Grand opera, we are assured, is built upon the basic passions of man, and much that is evil is incorq porated therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Yill the people of a restored earth wish to witness the tempting of </span><span class="font7">Marguerite </span><span class="font6">by Mephisto, even to the tune of beautiful music 1 Will they vdsh to see her misery after the murder of </span><span class="font7">her </span><span class="font6">chHd at the instigation of the cunning devil, all the while seeing his sneering, arrogant . countenance as he glories in the </span><span class="font7">style </span><span class="font6">of work i he has been doing against poor, </span><span class="font7">fallen </span><span class="font6">humanity these many centuries; and finally </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font6">see the going to heaven as pictured at the end of the opera, which </span><span class="font7">it </span><span class="font6">seems is strictly at variance with Bible teaching? 'rindured through and through with error and the superstition associated with Satan's empire </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">st</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font4">r</span><span class="font6">y could not </span><span class="font7">be </span><span class="font6">of interest to </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">race growing </span><span class="font7">back into the very image of </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">Verfect -Maker! </span><span class="font7">A </span><span class="font6">performance of Faust depicting his past deviltries would be about the . only pleasure that a </span><span class="font7">chained </span><span class="font6">Lucifer might </span><span class="font7">have; </span><span class="font6">and I think he win be denied even that. Would the </span><span class="font7">fiery </span><span class="font6">Carmen be </span><span class="font7">in any </span><span class="font6">better taste? Think of the bull fight, tho stabbing, and all the rest of the bloodthirstiness in Carmen which even our refined people now have not the courage to condemn; for Carmen is </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">standard opera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the things of </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">coining </span><span class="font7">age </span><span class="font6">will be such that the heart of man can iiot now conceive of them then it will be of no advantage 'to save even </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">music of these operas; for they would, </span><span class="font7">always . </span><span class="font6">carry with thein the hatefnl associations of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In th </span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font6">field of art, where would </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">man perfect &quot;in body and mind . </span><span class="font7">get </span><span class="font6">any good out of looking at anything </span><span class="font7">like the </span><span class="font6">Laocoon group with the </span><span class="font7">three figures ' </span><span class="font6">twisting and writhing in th</span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font6">coib of serpents? In this' 'respect I </span><span class="font7">should like </span><span class="font6">to think that the forni8r things will not be recalled, </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font6">paraphrase </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">passage of Scripture. The Laocoon story is based on myth, from which source so n1uc11 of the world's Inischief has conle. 1fyth has been called &quot;fact distorted&quot;; in other ,vords, </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">truth has been twisted and lied about so thoroughly that it serves well </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">o carry out Satan's schemes. flow luuch nlyth and superstition sometimes c</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font6">ll</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font6">d n1yth there is in th</span><span class="font4">e </span><span class="font6">world today! Beautiful myths, some say. Yes; and there are beautiful lies that smne </span><span class="font7">people </span><span class="font6">prefer to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Venus de lVlilo has been much </span><span class="font7">admired </span><span class="font6">f</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font6">r her figure, and it is beautiful. But a restored race will so far outstrip Venus that her attractions will be outshone then; and she, too, is another myth. As for pictures, while many of them </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font6">inspiring and good to see, many of them will be out of tunc with a perfect earth. VVhere would we put sonle of the old, discolored portraits of kings and queens who ruled with Inight, but with no mercy; and some of the portraits of the popes and other church dignitaries of bygone centuries showing men of advanced years, &quot;high livers&quot; and &quot;hard lookers&quot;, as some of </span><span class="font7">them </span><span class="font6">were 1 </span><span class="font7">Do </span><span class="font6">you remember that awful, malicious expression of one of the popes l1alned &quot;Innocent&quot;? </span><span class="font7">I </span><span class="font6">fear that some of these things would be as </span><span class="font7">thorns </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font7">the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a number of pictures called &quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot;, </span><span class="font7">based </span><span class="font6">on </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">myth, also. Paris was </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">shepherd and was chosen to decide which was the most beautiful-Venus, Juno or 1vIinerva. Each of these goddesses prolnised hirn </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">reward if he gave her the golden apple, which was the sign of being the nl0st beautiful. Venus promised </span><span class="font7">him the </span><span class="font6">most beautiful wonlan in the world as his wife, and Paris gave her the apple. The most beautiful woman was Helen of Troy, ' a married woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Venus was not 'blessed with good principles. So she helped Paris steal Helen ■ </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">Troy, who seems to have gone .willingly,with hini; and to get her back her husband stirred up the trouble </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font6">precipitated the Trojan War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jnno and Minervu, ' angered beyond expres-f'ion, </span><span class="font7">took sides against •Venus and </span><span class="font6">P</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font7">is</span><span class="font6">; and SHch </span><span class="font7">a display of petty jealousy, ferocity, and general uproar could hardly be exceeded.

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">OME </span><span class="font7">months ago, while '</span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font7">was seated at dinner with a company of probably over one hundred friends, one of them drew from his pocket a piece of lead^ ab</span><span class="font6">o</span><span class="font7">ut an inch square, ' on one side of which was an inscription of the Lord's Prayer. </span><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font7">workmanship was a sample of marked ability on the part of the inscriber, and caused many remarks on the part of </span><span class="font6">the company. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perceiving that this. inscription hardly compared with </span><span class="font6">what I have </span><span class="font7">read along 'the same line in an . Arabic ma gazine, I was encouraged </span><span class="font6">to give </span><span class="font7">an account of the article which I had </span><span class="font6">read and </span><span class="font7">to send </span><span class="font6">it </span><span class="font7">to Trm </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age..</span><span class="font6"> The substance of </span><span class="font7">the arti cle follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Remarkable Ability in Fine Handwriting</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">-YOUNG Sy</span><span class="font7">rian nian who has </span><span class="font6">marvelous </span><span class="font7">ability to use his pen has written ' </span><span class="font6">sixty-one </span><span class="font7">wo rd s on a grain of rice. This . grain was </span><span class="font4">ex</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font7">bi</span><span class="font6">ted .at </span><span class="font7">a fair in Zehlet, Syria, where </span><span class="font6">it.</span><span class="font4">won </span><span class="font7">the first prize. On another occasion he </span><span class="font6">pre^</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">274</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pared </span><span class="font7">what is called -&quot;The Notable </span><span class="font6">Egg of . </span><span class="font7">Independence&quot;. This is a piece ' of marble in size and shape like a hen's egg. Upon it was drawn the Turkish imperial cipher, which consists of </span><span class="font6">eight </span><span class="font7">or more words, reading </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font7">Arabic:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">0\;. </span><span class="font7">..I_jaJl </span><span class="font6">^ </span><span class="font9">0\1.LJ^\ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">j.</span><span class="font6"> \ </span><span class="font9">0\;&quot; Wl </span><span class="font6">^ 0\kLJWJ\</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the Emglish equivalent of which is, Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan, the son of Sultan-Abdul - Aziz Khan. The egg also had drawn upon it the preface to- the Turkish Constitution in the Turkish language, the Constitution itself in the Arabic language, the date of the Declaration, two poems relating- to the independence and the </span><span class="font6">arniY, </span><span class="font7">fifty-nine stanzas in all, and a chart of the Turkish domain with the names of-all its principal cities. The &quot;heel&quot; of the egg is left ‘without - writing, and is large enough fo hold more than a thousand words. The approximate number of words written upon the egg is about ten thousand, exclusive - of the Turkish inscription and the map of the kingdom. The writing 'can not be erased. About one thousand pens were employed in doing the job, and about two years were expended in the writing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font7">third piece of wonderful workmanship was the writing- of one hundred, and one words upon a grain of wheat, which was presented - to the headquarters of the’ Red Cross at Washington, D. C. The words were an expression of thanks and appreciation of the charitable deeds of the Red Cross shown toward humanity during the </span><span class="font6">great . </span><span class="font7">World </span><span class="font6">War, and </span><span class="font7">especially those done towards, the sons of Syria-Syrian people. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still another exhibition of </span><span class="font6">fine </span><span class="font7">penmanship is shown on a grain of wheat now in the museum at Damascus, Syria. On this grain of wheat </span><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font7">written a poem containing - one hundred </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">thirteen words. Another is a - grain of rice on which are four chapters of the Koran, - in </span><span class="font6">all </span><span class="font7">one hundred andfourteen words. This </span><span class="font6">grain -</span><span class="font7">was exhibited at a fair in Beirut, Syria. At </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">same fair was exhibited a grain of - rice on which was written a sentence -in the French language, containing in all sixty-</span><span class="font6">fi</span><span class="font7">ve words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another marvel is a silver ring containin</span><span class="font9">g </span><span class="font7">a stone of five by six and one-half millimeters on which is written 'the genealogy of the Arabian King Hussein, of the Hedjaz, back to his ancestor the prophet Mohammed. This ring was -presented to his Majesty, King Hussein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On </span><span class="font7">a gold ring -in which -is set a ' silver plate -of seven by seven millimeters is an- inscription ' consisting of a poem with a preface. The </span><span class="font6">po8iTI </span><span class="font7">contains six stanzas embracing two hundred Seventy-six dates of events that occurred during the lifetime of King - Fuad of Ejgypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are indeed- wonderful things in that they show what man can do in his fallen - state, yes, after </span><span class="font6">6000 </span><span class="font7">years of nailing. They also sug-' gest what man may do with his God-given tal-&quot;ents when these are brought to perfection at the end of the incoming Golden Age, in which </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font7">am a firm believer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Day of Atonement</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE -Hebrews observe the Day of Atonement on the - tenth day of the seventh month - of the Hebrew religious year. This makes the annual observance fall about October 1st. On that day every orthodox Hebrew is supposed to spend virtually </span><span class="font6">all </span><span class="font7">his waking moments in worship, while the </span><span class="font6">361 </span><span class="font7">pages which now go to make -up the services of the day are being read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;\Ve have one of these Atonement Day service books in -hand. Page </span><span class="font6">1 </span><span class="font7">is in the back - </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">the book, and page </span><span class="font6">361- </span><span class="font7">in what we would regard as the front. Each right hand page, </span><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font7">in Hebrew, while the left hand pages are given </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">an English translation -of the - text opposite. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service is preceded by the sacrifice - </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">a cock, for the sin - </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">man. ‘ The </span><span class="font6">vain </span><span class="font7">tradition </span><span class="font6">is that </span><span class="font7">&quot;Gever -[a man] has sinned, and </span><span class="font6">only </span><span class="font7">Gever</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[a cock—the same word in the He brew] can </span><span class="font6">pay </span><span class="font7">the penalty.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The language of ' the ritual is sublime. </span><span class="font6">It </span><span class="font7">includes Psahn </span><span class="font6">145 </span><span class="font7">in its-entirety.

<p><span class="font7">The traditions respecting procedure on the Day of Atonement confirm the conclusions of Bible Students as to where the goats were presented for sacrifice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;He then proceeded to the east of the court, ' where two kids were placed, purchased by the congregation: they were both alike in form and height and stood there to make expiation for the iniquity of the backsliding daughter (the nation). There were two lots of gold, which, after shaking them in a box, he plunged his hand in, and drew out the lot for the Lord, and </span><span class="font4">i </span><span class="font5">he other for the strong rock : having put the lot on the kid, he proclaimed aloud, A sin offering to the Lord! Those who heard him, answered him by blessing the’ Lord. He tied a scarlet twist on the head of the scape-goat, and placed it exactly opposite to where </span><span class="font6">it </span><span class="font5">'was to be sent.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The traditions also show that on the Day of Atonement&quot; .the incense was offered in the Most Iloly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;He took a censer of pure gold, which was thin, </span><span class="font6">light, </span><span class="font5">and had a long handle, </span><span class="font6">and put into it </span><span class="font5">three Kabins of red hot. flaming coals: they then brought him a harge spoonful of , the finest beaten incense, . of which </span><span class="font6">he </span><span class="font5">took two handsful, and put into the lesser </span><span class="font6">spoon: </span><span class="font5">taking </span><span class="font6">the censer in his </span><span class="font5">right </span><span class="font6">h</span><span class="font4">an</span><span class="font5">d</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font6">and the </span><span class="font5">spoon in his left. He straight went toward the </span><span class="font6">vail, </span><span class="font5">and approached the staves of the ark between which he put the incense, causing the smoke to ascend.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to the’ disposition made of the scape-goat the Manual states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;He [the high priest] sent it [the scape-goat] with </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">proper person to the strong rock; in the desert, that it might carry away the sins of this people to an uninhabited country: he threw it down from the point of the rock, and rolling over as it descended, its bones were broken, as one breaketh a potter's vessel.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of our readers will note with keenest interest the following passage in the Manual and will make immediate and proper applica.. tion to the world's great High Priest, the Christ, Head and body, as He will appear to the world when the time of sacrificing is over and the time of blessing has come:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Verily, how glorious was the appearance of the high priest, when he came forth from the holy sanctuary, without any evil occurrence.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark44"></a>How May One Become a Christian?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Watchtower 'VBBR on a wave length of 273 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">MONG the people there is much lnisun-derstanding about how one may become a Christian. This misunderstanding is due to the fact that the people have not been taught the truth according to the Bible. 11any professed teachers of the Bible have stood before their congregations and said to them: 'All that is necessary for you to become a Christian is to come forward, at smne church meeting, say that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, have your name placed upon the church roll, be baptized or sprinkled with water, receive the right hand of fellowship and thereafter contribute your part to the minister's salary and to the up-keep of the church expense.' l\Iany of you ,who now hear illy voice know from experience that these are what you have been.told to be the necessary steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only safe rule to lay down in the begin, ning is to refuse to accept any man's opinion as to how you may become . a Christian; because the opinions of men, unsupported by competent evidence coming from a truthful source, ,vill not be taken as evidence in any earthly court of law, and surely as muyh or more should be required to establish the truth upon such a vital question as becoming a 'Christian. Evidence therefore should always he required to support this answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Christian means a faithful follower </span><span class="font6">of Christ. </span><span class="font7">The word Christ means the anointed one. Jesus Christ, the first anointed one, is the Head over His Church, which are members of His body, (Colossians 1:18) Where, then, may we expect to find the truth upon this great question </span><span class="font6">? J</span><span class="font7">esus answers this identical question and says: &quot;Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.&quot; ( John 17: 17) The Bible is the Word of God given to man for his ■ ' instruction in righteousness. (2 Timothy </span><span class="font6">3:</span><span class="font7">16) There we shall find the true answer as to how to become a Christian, and nowhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Man a Sinner</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">CHRISTIAN must be a follo&quot;wer of Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus. Christ Jesus on earth was a perfect roan. All other men were born sinners. So say St. Paul in Ron1ans 5:12 and the Prophet in Psalm 51: 5. lvlan, being conscious of the </span><span class="font6">fact </span><span class="font7">that he is imperfect and a sinner, needs</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">some help; and when he desires to • turn </span><span class="font6">away </span><span class="font7">fron1 the course of u'nrighteousness, come to Jesus and do right, he has corne to the point of repentance. Repentance means a change </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">mind. How can he coiiie to Jesus&quot; -who is the Redeemer </span><span class="font6">? </span><span class="font7">Jesus answers the question : </span><span class="font6">&quot;No </span><span class="font7">man can coine to me, except the Fa</span><span class="font6">t</span><span class="font7">her which hath sent me draw him.&quot; (John 6:44) God draws a man to Jesus by calling to his attention through some one else or through His </span><span class="font6">W</span><span class="font7">ord that Jesus is the great Redeemer of mankind. </span><span class="font6">1\1</span><span class="font7">an, being thus drawn to jesus, and seeing that lIe is the Savior and turning avvay £1'0111 the world to follow the- righteous Lord, is converted. Conversion means a change of course of action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of you have been told by your ministers that to repent and to be converted is all that is necessary for you to go to heaven. </span><span class="font6">.A.s </span><span class="font7">a Inat-tel' of fact it is not even starting for heaven. St. Peter (Acts </span><span class="font6">3:</span><span class="font7">19) said: &quot;Repent, ...and be converted, that your sins nlay be blotted out.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one is drawn to Jesus he learns from the Bible, or otherwise being taught, that Christ Jesus gave flis life a sacrifice in order that mankind might have an opportunity for life. Some Scriptural proof upon this is at follows : John 10: 10; lVfatthew 20: 28; Hebre\vs 2:9 ; Acts </span><span class="font6">4: </span><span class="font7">11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Learning then that there is no other name under heaven whereby he may be saved man asks: What, shall I do </span><span class="font6">? </span><span class="font7">This same identical question was asked, and the answer recorded in Acts 16: </span><span class="font6">31 </span><span class="font7">as follows: &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&quot; To believe does not merely mean to have a mental conception that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. The devil believes that. But if </span><span class="font4">we </span><span class="font7">believe a thing, and know that to act upon </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font7">thing will bring us good results and blessings, 'we prove our belief by our acts. If we believe, then, that Jesus is the way to life and that there is no other 'way, and if we want to live, then we prove our belief by taking the steps the Scriptures point out that \ve must take. Jesus said </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font7">John ' 17: </span><span class="font6">3: </span><span class="font7">&quot;This is life eternal, that they might kno'w thee the only true God, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Progressing to this point, the man </span><span class="font4">can see </span><span class="font7">that he was born </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">sinner, and </span><span class="font6">that by </span><span class="font4">reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">sin he has 'been alienated from God; that for </span><span class="font6">hiin </span><span class="font7">to live he must, through Christ Jesus, get back into ■ harmony with God. ' What then ' shall he do </span><span class="font6">? </span><span class="font7">Jesus answers: </span><span class="font6">&quot;I </span><span class="font7">am the way, and the truth, and ' the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.&quot;—John ' 14: </span><span class="font6">6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It follows, then, from this Scriptural answer' that in order to live, as a Christian, one must come to God ' through Christ; and that one ' must </span><span class="font6">coine </span><span class="font7">in God's appointed way. And what is that way? To this question Jesus answers ' 'in .Matthew 1</span><span class="font6">6</span><span class="font7">: 24: &quot;If any man will cohie after . me, let hiin deny himself, and take up his 'cross, and follow’ me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since a Christian 'is ' a follower </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">Jesus, the man now must know what ' Jesus did in order that ' he may follow Him. Jesus, the perfect . man, at the time of His legal majority presented himself to Jehovah, saying, as it was propheti</span><span class="font6">cally </span><span class="font7">written of him, </span><span class="font6">&quot;Lo, </span><span class="font7">I come,... to' do </span><span class="font6">thy' </span><span class="font7">will, 0. my God.&quot; (Psalm 40 : </span><span class="font6">7,8; ' </span><span class="font7">Hebrews </span><span class="font6">10: 7) </span><span class="font7">Jesus was perfect, had </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">right to live </span><span class="font6">on </span><span class="font7">earth forever, had the • perfect </span><span class="font6">right' </span><span class="font7">to exercise his own will to this effect. </span><span class="font6">His </span><span class="font7">life had been transferred, • however, from the spirit to the human plane. for • </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">purpose; and now He was -saying to Jehovah, His Father: Whatsoever ts thy will&quot; I agree to do it.' This was the consecration of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was the will of God that Jesus should die upon the cross as a perfect man in order to . meet the requirements. of the • divine law </span><span class="font4">en</span><span class="font7">forced against the perfect man Admn, to the end that Adani and all of his offspring </span><span class="font6">might </span><span class="font7">be released from the condemnation and have an opportunity for life. (Romans 5:18, 19) For this reason Jesus died, as </span><span class="font6">stated in </span><span class="font7">John </span><span class="font6">3:16, </span><span class="font7">17, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">dying .in obedience • to the Father's will, God raised Ifim out • of death a divine being, and ' exalted Him above all other creatures </span><span class="font6">in the </span><span class="font7">universe.—Philippians 2: 5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore it is. seen that what Jesus meant when He said a man must deny himself, was that man must agree to do the • will of God and' trust </span><span class="font6">in ■ </span><span class="font7">the merit </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">Christ Jesus. Hence • the next step for the man to take </span><span class="font6">be</span><span class="font7">fore he becomes' a Christian is consecration. ' This means ' a full and uncondition</span><span class="font6">al </span><span class="font7">surrender of oneself • to Jehovah, trusting </span><span class="font6">in the L</span><span class="font7">or</span><span class="font6">d </span><span class="font7">Jesus Christ as his • Redeemer. He does not have to do this. before </span><span class="font6">an -assembled -b</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font6">d</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">people, with the ' </span><span class="font6">minister </span><span class="font7">standing in the </span><span class="font6">pulpit. </span><span class="font7">IIe </span><span class="font6">may </span><span class="font7">go to his own closet alone or to the woods and, kneeling down before the 'Lord, humbly submit hiniself to </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">Lord by telling the Lord in his heart that </span><span class="font6">he </span><span class="font7">desires to do IIis holy ' will, and that he has </span><span class="font6">full </span><span class="font7">faith and confidence in Jesus as his Savior. </span><span class="font6">This </span><span class="font7">is exactly what. Cornelius did.—Acts 10:44, </span><span class="font6">45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For such the Lord Jesus Christ; the Redeemer, stands as Advocate or Sponsor. (1 John 2:1, 2) Upon the basis of faith .in.the blood of Christ Jesus, Jehovah now 'accepts the </span><span class="font4">mail </span><span class="font7">’ who ' consecrates himself, and justifies </span><span class="font6">him. </span><span class="font7">Justification means made right with God. Three steps are essential to. justification, as the Serinhires 'read: By </span><span class="font6">faith </span><span class="font7">are we justified ' (Romans 5:1); we are 'justified by the blood of </span><span class="font6">Christ </span><span class="font7">(Romans . 5:</span><span class="font6">9) </span><span class="font7">; it is God that justifies. (Romans </span><span class="font6">8: 33) </span><span class="font7">Otherwise stated: (1) The first essential is our faith, which means belief and ' exercising that belief in the Lord's Word by consecration; and (2) the blood or merit of_ Christ imputed '</span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">us as a basis upon which Jehovah acts; and ' </span><span class="font6">(3) </span><span class="font7">the judicial determination by J ep.ovah that the one thus consecrating ' himself is right with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All justified creatures have the right to. live. All justified men have a right to life on the earth. But now, having agreed to- do God's holy will, what is' the will of God concerning the one now justified ? </span><span class="font6">■ </span><span class="font7">The, answer is </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font7">justification during the Gospel Age is 'only for the purpose of permitting the one justified </span><span class="font6">to -</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font7">be a joint sacrifice! with Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6">What, </span><span class="font7">then, does he sacrifice </span><span class="font6">? </span><span class="font7">The answer is, He </span><span class="font4">sac</span><span class="font7">rifices his right to live on the </span><span class="font6">earth </span><span class="font7">as . a human being. (2 </span><span class="font6">Timothy </span><span class="font7">2:11, 12) And when this is done, what follows </span><span class="font6">1 The </span><span class="font7">answer is </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font7">he is begotten to the divine nature by </span><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font7">ehovah. Begetting means a </span><span class="font6">beginning. </span><span class="font7">This niean8 </span><span class="font6">that ' </span><span class="font7">now by the will of God the man has become </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">Christian.

<p><span class="font7">Concerning his future office, </span><span class="font6">the Lord says to </span><span class="font7">him</span><span class="font4">: </span><span class="font7">&quot;Be thou </span><span class="font6">faithful </span><span class="font7">unto death, </span><span class="font6">and I will </span><span class="font7">give thee a </span><span class="font4">CrOS'{ll </span><span class="font3">of life.&quot; (Revelation </span><span class="font6">2: 10) This </span><span class="font7">means the </span><span class="font3">highest </span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font7">en</span><span class="font4">1</span><span class="font7">ent of </span><span class="font6">life, parti</span><span class="font7">ci</span><span class="font6">pat</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font6">ng with </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">Lord in IIis kingdom.

<p><span class="font7">The office of the </span><span class="font6">.i,.'\.nointed Priesthood dur</span><span class="font7">ing the reign or Christ is to bless the world by giving them </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">knowledge of the divine plan and by teaching mankind the way that leads to life. The faithful Christians are the seed of Abraham according to the promise. (Galatians </span><span class="font6">3:16, </span><span class="font7">27-29) The promise was that through this seed all the families of the earth should be blessed.-Genesis </span><span class="font6">1</span><span class="font7">2 </span><span class="font4">: </span><span class="font6">3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Christian, therefore, is really in this life in training for his future ,York. It is not the business of the Christian now to convert the world, but it is his office and duty to be </span><span class="font6">a wit</span><span class="font7">ness for the Lord in the earth to- tell others about the gracious things that are coming to mankind through the Lord's kingdom. It requires much courage to be </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">Christian now; because- he must withstand the taunts, jeers and misrepresentation of the world, who know nothing about God's arrangement. But the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and 'with its full establish-nlent the work of the 'Christian will take on </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">far greater scope.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Fresno's Newspaper Battle</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">RESNO, California, has been having </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">news, paper battle. vVe reprint two of the many letters which appeared while the conflict was on, feeling sure that many of our readers </span><span class="font6">will </span><span class="font7">enjoy them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Republican:</span><span class="font5"> I have been interested and somewhat amused at the letters from members of the so-called &quot;Bible Students Association&quot; in ,.reply to your recent editorial concerning what their great mogul, Rutherford, said about the eighteenth amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nat one of these letter writers has made any attempt to either deny or explain what Mr. Rutherford is alleged to have said, but each one props up a little man of straw, marked persecution, and proceeds to bark at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is the leading stock in trade of those fellows, but it is silly. No one is persecuting them. The fact is that if they did not yell out &quot;Persecution ! Persecution!&quot; every now and then, and advertise lectures with &quot;no collections&quot; nineteen-twentieths of the Christian world would not know that such people existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, they should remember the proverb concerning glass houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I heard their great demigod, Russell, preach; and in one of his sermons I heard more abuse of other churches and more sarcasm concerning other preachers than I have ever heard altogether in all other churches I have ever attended. May I not say here, too, that I challenge any Bible Student in America to' prove that he has heard more sermons from more different preachers than </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">have listened to. The fact is that I have yet to hear —the first preacher of any denomination mention either Russell or Rutherford in a sermon, so far as I can now remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one cares what Bible doctrine they hold to. If they want to believe as Russell intimated in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">o</span><span class="font4">ne </span><span class="font5">of his books,thatthe body of Jesus mayhave become decomposed and gone off into gases, since it never rose from the dead, let them believe it. Again, ifthey believe as their present mog</span><span class="font6">gul</span><span class="font5">l Hutheriord, teaches, that after </span><span class="font6">1925 </span><span class="font5">no one need die, I am willing. Every Christian will agree with me in this; but when their leader takes an attitude toward the laws of our land that will really encourage lawlessness, then I take the attitude that his room is better than his company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one, you, </span><span class="font6">1fr. </span><span class="font5">Editor, included, has accused any of the Bible Students of being bootleggers or boozers; but no one can deny that the stand recently taken by their leader encourages bootlegging and boozing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I believe firmly in religious liberty ; but when one's religious liberty leads him to go contrary to the laws ,of the country in which he lives, then he should seek </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">home in some other country. Either this, or seek in a proper manner to have the laws changed, but ob</span><span class="font4">e</span><span class="font5">y them until they are changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one can be a good Christian or a good American who encourages lawlessness against our nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(REV.) J. W. M'KEAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">American Sunday School Union, Fresno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer to Above. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fresno, Calif., July 30, </span><span class="font6">1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Editor, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Republican: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If my memory serves me right, I had the pleasure of meeting Rev. M'Kean during a former visit to this city. During my years of reportorial activity it has seldom been my privilege to meet a more interesting man. With .this introduction, I trust he will take in good part my comments on his good-humored thrust at the Bible Students in Wednesday's issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I hold no brief for the Bible Students, but among them I do number some good friends and neighbors. Also, I have met and personally known both 1fr. </span><span class="font6">C. T. </span><span class="font5">Russell and Mr. J. </span><span class="font6">F. </span><span class="font5">Rutherford. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rev. M'Kean observes that none of the Bible Students has attempted to either deny or explain what </span><span class="font6">111'. </span><span class="font5">Rutherford is alleged to have said at Columbus, Ohio, on the subject of the 18th Amendment recently, but that instead &quot;each one props </span><span class="font6">up </span><span class="font5">a little man of straw and proceeds to bark at it&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not so- good, Reverend. Rev. M'Kean is connected with the &quot;American Sunday School Union&quot;. Now, just for the sake of comparison, let's suppose that one of the moguls (or demigods, whichever title is preferred) of the American Sunday School Union is speaking at </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">convention in Tokyo.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">I-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">I can in my mind's eye picture the bored reporters at the table below the speaker's platform. They have been listening to what has been to them a very somnif erous sermon, and have well-nigh despaired of catch ing a single striking phrase which can be played up for </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">lead'. In fact, they would dearly love to- see the report headed &quot;Priest Sermon Ever Preached&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(This 'is by no means meant as a reflection against the Sunday School Union speakers. Most sermons sound that way to the usual reporter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Suddenly every reporter sits </span><span class="font6">up </span><span class="font5">with </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">jerk and begins to make notes with lightning speed. The speaker has forcibly criticized the 19th Amendment to- the Constitution! (We shall merely suppose this, although I have heard more than one high church official make this very criticism.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Associated Presto </span><span class="font6">I—</span><span class="font5">and every city, town, ham</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font5">et, and home in Christendom has been apprised </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5">leader, mogul, demigod, of the Sunday School Union has rapped women's suffrage ! Editorial comments quickly appear, more or less sharply condemning the speaker for his alleged stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now then, what would Rev. M'Kean do in such a pass ? Could he deny the report ? Hardly, since he is presume</span><span class="font6">d </span><span class="font5">to be in Fresno just then, and not in Tokyo. Could he explain the report? Not very well, since he was not the speaker who- made the alleged remark. He would, logically, do only what the local Bible Students have done in their own case :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He would object to editorial condemnation without more complete verification and would assure the public -and possibly also his wife-that he himself is not opposed to women's suffrage, the constitution, and the laws of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, from what I know of Bible Students, I do not believe a single one of them would say that Rev. M'Kean thereby &quot;props </span><span class="font6">up </span><span class="font5">a little man of straw and proceeds to bark at it&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After mentioning that he heard Mr. Russell abuse other preachers and churches, Rev. M'Kean tells us of the great number of different sermons he has heard and says : &quot;The fact is that I have yet </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">hear the first preacher of any denomination mention either Russell of Rutherford in </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">sermon.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As I said, I do not feel especially called upon to defend the Bible Students; ■ buf in the spirit of fair play </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">wish to say </span><span class="font6">that I have </span><span class="font5">also heard </span><span class="font6">Mr. </span><span class="font5">Russell and Mr. Rutherford; and have repeat8dly reportJ </span><span class="font6">their </span><span class="font5">lectures for the pres's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both have made some very sharp criticisms of preachers and churches. Some of these criticisms I myself cannot subscribe to and never will approve of. But </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">must admit this much, that the Bible Students </span><span class="font6">can </span><span class="font5">safely challenge Rev. M'Kean to prove that either Mr. Russell or Mr. Rutherford ever made a personal </span><span class="font6">criti</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font5">cism directed against any clergyman individually. Their &quot;abuse and sarcasm&quot;, if you wish to- </span><span class="font6">call </span><span class="font5">it such, has always been entirely impersonal, and invariably coupled with the qualifying statement that their charges did not apply to all preachers and all ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In direct contrast to this, Rev. M'Kean knO'ws that Rev. Billy Sunday habitually heaps the vilest of abuse on the very clergymen seated upon his lecture platform, and that the clerical gentlemen sit there and take it all with a smile. </span><span class="font6">To </span><span class="font5">select some of his mildest epithets, he calls them' &quot;lily livered skunks, semi-spineless cactus plants, lop-sided and long-haired sob-sisters, refrigerator rats,&quot; etc., etc. r:rhe clergy take this vituperation smiling, but grow indignant over the statements of Russell and Rutherford. The worst &quot;abuse and sarcasm&quot; that the last-named speakers ever voiced against preachers or churches are compliments compared to the vilification of Rev. Billy Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">N ow to take the other side of the story. Rev. M'Kean says he has &quot;yet to hear the first- preacher of any denomination mention either Russell or RutheTford in </span><span class="font4">a. </span><span class="font5">sermon&quot;. I believe him, of course. 'With a little care, it is quite possible to accomplish this </span><span class="font6">feat. I </span><span class="font5">presume the gentleman has carefully avoided visiting-evangelists and their tents ; for it is well known that one of the stock discourses of an evangelist is at least one all-night tirade against &quot;Russellism&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rev. M'Kean must also have made at least some s&amp;o lection as to- which church to attend; for during my own • frequent trips through this beautiful valley I have several times observed advertisements and reports in local papers which seemed to indicate that both Russell and RutheTford were &quot;mentioned&quot; by clergymen in their . sermons, and mentioned rather violently, one would gather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">must also add that I have personally reported </span><span class="font6">for </span><span class="font5">publication at least a dozen sermons, some. of them by; the most noted lights of the Protestant firmament, </span><span class="font6">i11 </span><span class="font5">which Russell and RutheTford were not only &quot;mentioned&quot;, but were mentioned in language which was abusive to’ the last degree. What is more, the speakers in three of the instances made personal charges against these men which I knew to be entirely contrary to the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, every denominational book-room of anj size that I have ever entered has </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">full stock of books, pamphlets, and tracts, all prominently displayed, </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font5">which Russell and Rutherford </span><span class="font6">are </span><span class="font5">most certainly </span><span class="font4">&quot;men.. </span><span class="font6">ti</span><span class="font5">o</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font6">eCl&quot;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font6">and ' mentioned in words </span><span class="font5">th</span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font5">t </span><span class="font6">would </span><span class="font5">make </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">saint </span><span class="font4">weep.

<p><span class="font5">&quot;2. The Pope teaches people to worship the Virgin, the saints, and even the bones and other relics and the pictures and images of saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;3. The Bible teaches that! there are only two places aiter death—heaven and hell; the Pope/teaches </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">third —purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;4. </span><span class="font5">The Bible characterizes forbidding to marry and commanding abstinence from meat the doctrine of devils. The Pope forbids his clergy to marry and commands to abstain from meat on Fridays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;5. </span><span class="font5">Christ bids us 'Search the Scriptures.' The Pope forbids the search of Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;6. </span><span class="font5">Christ bids us 'Preach the Gospel.' The Pope neglects the preaching of the Gospel, and substitutes ceremonies, processions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;7. </span><span class="font5">The • Bible teaches that holiness is obedience to God's Commandments. The Pope teaches obedience ' to the Pope's commandments.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father Bryne-Grant denounced these seven statements in such violent terms that a stranger to Roman Catholic tactics would think they were the vilest kind of falsehoods. Let us examine then one by one. The two following official canons of the Church - of Rome prove conclusively that both the doctrine of Jnstification by faith and those who believe it are &quot;accursed&quot; :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;If anyone shall say that the ungodly man is </span><span class="font6">justi</span><span class="font5">fied by faith only so as to understand that nothing </span><span class="font4">else </span><span class="font5">is required that may cooperate to obtain the </span><span class="font4">grace </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">justification, and that it is in </span><span class="font4">no </span><span class="font6">wise necessary </span><span class="font4">for </span><span class="font5">him to </span><span class="font6">be </span><span class="font5">p</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font5">epared and disposed by the </span><span class="font4">m</span><span class="font5">ot</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font4">on </span><span class="font5">of his </span><span class="font4">oown. </span><span class="font5">will—let him be accursed.&quot;—Canon </span><span class="font6">9, Coun</span><span class="font5">cil of Trent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;If anyone, shall say that ju</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font5">tifying ' faith is nothing else than confidence </span><span class="font4">in </span><span class="font5">t</span><span class="font6">h</span><span class="font5">e Divine </span><span class="font4">mercy </span><span class="font5">pardoning sins for Christ's sake; or that it is that confiUence alone by which we are justified—let him be accursed.&quot;-,Canon 12, Council of Trent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father Grant disdains to' answer the second statenlent. &quot;It is too stupid and absurd to be worth answering,&quot; he said. He points out that &quot;$1,000 reward has been offered&quot; by &quot;Our Sunday Visitor,&quot; a violent' Romanist - paper published in Huntington, Indiana, for anyone - who can prove that the Roman Church teaches her people to adore the Virgin Mary or the saints. -&quot;Our Sunday Visitor&quot; and Father Bryne-Grant are quite safe in issuing this loud challenge, because they make it with a: mental reservation. It is the simplest thing in the world to prove to those who accept the Bible as the only rule -of. faith and practice that the Roman Church teaches the worship of Virgin, saints, images and relics. The mental reservation as to degree of worship is explained helo\v. Besides that, who could give impartial judgment in such a controversy ? The' first question to settle 'would be: What is the m'easure, the depth and the degree of worship that is due to God alone 1 To Protestants who beliove the Bible an religious or spiritual worship is due to God, but the Roman systelTI attempts to divide religions worship into three separate water-tight </span><span class="font4">COIl1-</span><span class="font6">partments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rome Divides Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T </span><span class="font6">IS necessary to explain that the Church of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rome divids religious worship into three kinds :—1. &quot;Latria,&quot; due to - God alone. </span><span class="font7">2. </span><span class="font6">&quot;IIy-perdulia,&quot; to the Virgin. 3. </span><span class="font4">&quot;</span><span class="font6">Duli</span><span class="font4">a,</span><span class="font6">&quot; to the saints. Such -distinctions are false in theory and useless in practice, ' as Rev. Dr. Blakeney has pointed out in his &quot;Manual of Roniish Controversy.&quot; • The word' &quot;dulia&quot; often denotes the' service - belonging to God alone. It is the ideI1-<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tical word translated ((serve&quot; and &quot;serving&quot; in the following among other verses in the Bible : <sup>&lt;f</sup>Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;-—Matt. 6: 24. &quot;Ye turned from idols to serve the living and true God.&quot;-l Thess. 1:9. &quot;Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.&quot;—Romans 12: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Word of God therefore conunands that &quot;dulia,&quot; which the R-oman Church teaches is the least of her three degrees of worship, is to be given to the Lord only. It follows that ''hyperdulia,'' a higher degree of worship, so called by Rome, is to be given to God alone. But the Bible noes not recognize any of Rome's fine distinctions. Our God is &quot;a jealous God, and he will not suffer his glory—any degree of it—to be given to another, nor his praise —any degree' or part of it—to he given to graven images.&quot; &quot;Him only shalt thou serve,&quot; or honor with dulia, hyperdulia or latria worship, is the plain and unmistakable command of the eternal God, who is the same yesterday, to-day and forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following authoritative quotations from papal sources prove that the Pope and his church teach their people to worship Virgin, saints and images, in violation of the plain com-nlands of the Bible :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In &quot;The Glories of 1\Iary,&quot; written by St. A. 'di Liguori, approved by the Vatican and recommended to the faithful by Cardinal vViseman and Cardinal Manning, are these prayers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Thou (Mary) art my only hope; thou alone canst </span><span class="font6">help </span><span class="font5">mel^page 20. Hrrhou art the only advocate of sinners&quot;; and &quot;Through thee we have been reconciled with our God&quot;—page </span><span class="font6">248. </span><span class="font5">&quot;VVe often obtain more promptly what we ask by calling on the name of Mary than by invoking that of Jesus&quot;—page </span><span class="font6">112.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pope Pius IX., in an encyclical letter, dated Dec. 8, 1869, instructed the faithful as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;'But in order that God may accede more easily t</span><span class="font6">o our </span><span class="font5">and your prayers, and to those of ell his faithful servants, let us employ in all confidence as our mediatrix with Him the Virgin :Mary, Mother of God, ;who has destroyed all heresies throughout the world, and who, the most loving mother of us all, is very gracious </span><span class="font0">•..</span><span class="font5">and full of mercy ...allows herself to be entreated by all, shows herself most clement towards </span><span class="font6">al , </span><span class="font5">and takes under her pitying care all our necessities with </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5">most ample affection, and who, sitting as queen upon the right hand </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">her only .. begotten Son, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out</span><span class="font5"> Lord </span><span class="font6">Jesus </span><span class="font5">Christ, in a golden vestment, clothed around with various adornments, there </span><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font5">nothing which she cannot obtain from Him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following prayer. from the &quot;Missal for Every Day,&quot; is offered in every Roman Catholic Church on Dec. 6th:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;0 </span><span class="font5">God, who didst adorn blessed Nicholas, the bishop, with miracles unnumbered, grant, we beseech Thee, that by his merits and prayers we may be delivered from </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">fires of hell.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many. similar prayers may he found in the Roman Missal, such as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;0 </span><span class="font5">God, who, to recommend to us innocence of life, wast pleased to let the soul of the Blessed Virgin ascend </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">heaven in the shape of </span><span class="font4">.a </span><span class="font5">dove, grant by her merits and prayers that we may lead innocent lives here, and ascend to eternal joys hereaiter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;May the intercession, </span><span class="font6">0 </span><span class="font5">Lord, of Bishop Peter, thy apostle, render the prayers and offerings of thy church acceptable </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">Thee, that the mysteries we celebrate in </span><span class="font6">his </span><span class="font5">honor may obtain for </span><span class="font6">us </span><span class="font5">the pardon of </span><span class="font6">our </span><span class="font5">sins.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Worship of hi-a&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;^I </span><span class="font5">MOST firmly assert that the images </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">Christ, </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font0">A </span><span class="font5">. the Mother 'of God, ever virgin, and also of other saints, may be had and retained, and that due honor and veneration are to be given them.&quot;—Article </span><span class="font6">8, </span><span class="font5">Creed of Pope Pius IV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Papal authorities disagree as to the degree of worship that is &quot;due&quot; to graven images. The Second Council of Nice declared : &quot;'And to give them (the images) the salutation and honorary worship, not indeed the true latria, according to our faith, which belongs to the divine nature only.&quot; But Saint Thomas Aquinas, whose works are all approved by the Vatican, teaches that supreme worship ought to be given to images :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Since, therefore, Christ is to be adored with the worship of Latria, it follows that His image is to be adored with the worship of latria.&quot;—Question </span><span class="font6">25. </span><span class="font5">Art, 3. 3rd Part, Sum. Theol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following from the Roman Pontifical, containing official papal instructions for the services at the ordination of priests, directs that &quot;latria,&quot; or supreme worship, is to be given to the crucifix belonging to the Pope's legate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The cross of the legate, because latria is due to it, should be on the right hand.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For all Scriptural, Protestant, practical and common-sense purposes it is therefore proven conclusively that the Roman system teaches the 'worship of Virgin, saints and images, but The Sentinel does not expect that Father Grant or &quot;Our Sunday 'Visitor&quot; will come across with that thousand-dollar cheque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father Bryne-Grant admits that his church teaches that there is a purgatory, for which </span><span class="font7">there is no Scriptural authority. It is unnecessary, therefore, to argue the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">N </span><span class="font7">either is it neeessary to argue the ' fourth assertion, for the Saskatoon priest admits that his church both teaches and practices that which is expressly condmnned in the Bible. The Bible teaches that &quot;Marriage is honorable in all,&quot; but priests and nuns are forbidden to marry. The Roman Church also commands abstinence from meat on certain days. Both of these, practices are plainly condemned by the Bible as &quot;doctrines of devils.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Father Bryne-Grant asserts that there is also a reward of $1,000 offerea by the same Romanist organ for anyone who can prove the- , </span><span class="font6">fifth </span><span class="font7">assertion in the </span><span class="font6">1N</span><span class="font7">alther League articles, namely, —that Roman. Catholics are forbidden to &quot;search the Scriptures.&quot; There is a mental reservation in this- loud challenge also. Let us examine the teachings of the Roman Church on the subject. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following a.re the first two articles of the creed of Pope Pius </span><span class="font6">IV.:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1 .—&quot;1 </span><span class="font5">most steadfastly admit and embrace apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions, and all other observances and constitutions of the same church.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2 .-&quot;I </span><span class="font5">also admit the Holy Script</span><span class="font4">u</span><span class="font5">res, according -to that sense which our holy mother the church has held, and does hold, to which it beiongs, to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures: N either will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The joke is that &quot;the Fathers&quot; are not &quot;unanimous&quot; on any point, so that for all practical purposes the Bible is a sealed book^ to devout Romanists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the English Churchman of Oct. 22, 1908, VV. Walsh quoted the following from page 201 of &quot;The Larger Catechism,&quot; prescribed by the then Pope, Pius </span><span class="font6">X., </span><span class="font7">for all the dioceses of the province of Rome:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—What ought </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5">Christian to do if a Bible should be offered hi</span><span class="font4">m </span><span class="font5">by a Protestant or by some emissary of Protestants ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—If a Christian should be offered a Bible by </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5">Protestant </span><span class="font4">or </span><span class="font5">by -some emissary of the Protestants</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font6">he </span><span class="font5">ought indignantly to spurn it, because it is forbidden by the church; and if he should have accepted it without ad</span><span class="font4">v</span><span class="font5">erting to what . it was, he should at once . pitch it into the fire or fetch it to his -riest.’’—From the &quot;Protestant's.

<p><span class="font7">Consider the following question and answers from Butler’s Catechism, the official Boman</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholic Church </span><span class="font6">Catechism in </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">Archdiocese </span><span class="font7">of Toronto: ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—What is the Catholic rule of faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—The revealed ■ Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—Of what does the revealed Word of God consist ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—It consists of two parts: the vVritten </span><span class="font6">Word, </span><span class="font5">called the Holy S</span><span class="font4">cr</span><span class="font5">ipture; and the unwritten </span><span class="font6">word, </span><span class="font5">called Divine Tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. '&quot;Q.-—-Are these two .parts of equal </span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font5">utho</span><span class="font4">r</span><span class="font5">ity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—Yes; because they have bee</span><span class="font4">n </span><span class="font5">equally revealed by God.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">_</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—Has no Christian nation or province since </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">time of the Apostles been converted by reading </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">Holy Scriptures ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—No; they have all been converted b y preachers, succeeding, by due authority, </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">the above-mentioned commission, given to the Apostles....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;B.—Is there any obligation of reading the . Scrip. tures ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—The Catholic clergy are required to read and </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">pray out of it every day. A more strict obligation or studying both the Written and Unwritten Word of God lies on the pastors, whose duty it is to inculcate it </span><span class="font4">to </span><span class="font5">the faithful. But there is no such gener al obligation incumbent on the laity: it being sufficient that they listen to it from their pastors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—Is it lawful for the laity to read the Holy Scriptures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—They may read them in the language in which they were written, as likewise in the ancient Vulgnte translation, which the church vouches to be authentic. They may also read them in approved modern versions ; but with due submission to the interpretation </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">authority of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Q.—Have any great evils ensued from an unrestricted reading of the Bible, in vulgar language, by the </span><span class="font4">uii-</span><span class="font5">learned and unstable ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;A.—Yes; numberless heresies and impieties; as also many rebellions and civil wars.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Volumes could be quoted from the highest papal authorities to the smne effect. By means of papal restrictions Ronlanists are practically forbidden to read the </span><span class="font6">Scriptures, </span><span class="font7">and they are certainly forbidden to -&quot;search&quot; them in </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">sense in which that word was used by Christ when He told </span><span class="font6">His </span><span class="font7">hearers to &quot;search the Scriptures.&quot; How many can read Hebrew </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font7">Greek, the </span><span class="font6">languages </span><span class="font7">in which the - Scriptures were written </span><span class="font6">1 </span><span class="font7">Ilow many can read Latin, </span><span class="font6">the l</span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font7">ng</span><span class="font4">u</span><span class="font7">ag</span><span class="font6">e </span><span class="font7">of the &quot;Vulgate Translation&quot;?

<p><span class="font6">s7°Seeing, then, that Jesus Christ is a ■■ glorious spirit being with a divine organism, and 'that as the wind cannot be seen, but comes and goes, so ,a spirit can thus come and go without being discerned by human eyes, could not our Lord be present and yet not observable by any natural eyes? That is exactly according to the facts. Satan </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">is</span><span class="font6"> a • spirit being. For many centuries Satan has been the god or invisible ruler of the present evil world (2 Corinthians 4:3,4); yet no human eyes have seen Satan, although men have felt his influence and still feel it. Satan is not only the god of this world, but . he is' the chief one of his' wicked, invisible heaven ; that is' to say, the invisible ruling order of things composed of Satan 'and the other fallen angels who exercise power over human beings. ' The apostle Peter said: &quot;&quot;Ve, according to his promise, look for nevv heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; (2 Peter 3 : 13; Revelation 21: 1-5) The coming kingdom of the Lord' is the new heavenly kingdom. • This new ruling power, the Messiah, is invisible, and will be' invisible to human eyes, -but ■ will establish in the earth visible agencies and representatives, namely, a nevv social and ' political order of things. ,Ve should not, therefore, expect the Lord's second coming to be in a body visible to human eyes, but should expect that He would be present, exercising His power in flis own sovereign way.</span></p>

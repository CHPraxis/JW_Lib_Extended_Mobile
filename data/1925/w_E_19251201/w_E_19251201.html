<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves (the restless, discontented) roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking to the things coming upon the earth (society); for the powers of the heavens (ecclesiasticsm) shall be shaken. . . When ye see these thmgs begin to come t© pass, then (mow that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Look up, lift up your heads, rejoice, for your redemption draweth nigh.—Matt. 24:33; Mark 13:29; Luke 21:25-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now being presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Oiristian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">also as a </span><span class="font7">channel of communication through which they may be readied with announcements of the Society’s conventions and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of tSb earning of </span><span class="font7">its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims&quot;, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews ef our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz.. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font7"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s</span><span class="font7"> Word. Oar treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is spedally for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font7"> (a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It Is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our leaders to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That </span><span class="font7">the church </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is “the </span><span class="font7">temple </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship”; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2; 20-22; Genesis 28 :14 ; Galatians 3: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,&quot; shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font7">man.” “a ransom for all,” and wid be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font7"> ‘Tn due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font7">glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tnat the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4 :12; Matthew 24: 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font7">Acts 3 :19-23 ; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1925</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.”—Isaiah 58:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">ATCHMEN are tuose who are on the alert to keep a close lookout that they may safeguard and properly care for the things of interest committed unto them. The Lord has committed to the anointed ones certain interests of his kingdom, and it becomes the privilege and duty of such to give proper care to these interests. We believe that the evidence is overwhelming in proof of the fact that the Lord is present and has assumed his power and begun his reign. His first work was the casting of Satan from heaven. Now he is giving a witness in the earth that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is man’s only hope of relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The members of the body of Christ yet on the earth are commissioned to give such a witness under the direction of their Head, Christ Jesus. These are the heavenly class. These are watchmen; and they see eye to eye, provided they are performing faithfully the commission granted unto them. Not everyone who is consecrated to the Lord is a watchman, and hence not everyone sees eye to eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The voice is a symbol of a message. This text shows that the watchmen are joyful, proving that at this time all the watchmen must be joyful. One sings in his heart, at least, when he is joyful. The watchmen have the message of the kingdom, and joyfully they tell others about it. Together and in harmony they lift up the message and joyfully give it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year just past the church has performed the commission given to her to comfort those that mourn. Some have been found in Zion who have not appreciated the joy of the Lord and have been mourning. Some of those have had their mourning turned to joy because some other member of Zion gave unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Receiving this joy of the Lord, these in turn have joined the other watchmen and with real joy have gone forth to proclaim the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the purpose of comforting and encouraging those in Zion and bringing greater joy to the watchmen, this annual report is made. The present commission given to the watchmen may be summed up in the words of Jesus, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) This command must be obeyed before the great and terrible day of the Lord which marks the complete overthrow of Satan’s empire. To have some part in carrying into action this command of the King is the greatest privilege that could be enjoyed by anyone now on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That chovah has a plan which he has been carrying out from the very beginning of man needs neither proof nor argument. We may be sure that his' plan will be carried forward in his own good way. It is written concerning Jesus Christ, “Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” (Psalm 110:4) The Scriptures speak of Melchizedek as being a priest of the most high God. He was further a type of him who is the executive officer of the divine plan. This is proof that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the great divine organization. He is the Head of Zion. Of course everything is subject to Jehovah God, but the Lord Jesus is the one to whom is committed all power in heaven and earth, and he uses that power in harmony with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The church constitutes the members of his body, over which Christ Jesus is the Head. Those members on the earth now are properly designated as “the feet of him”. These are the anointed class on earth, and these are they who are watchmen and who joyfully do the will of the Lord on earth. Since he commands what shall be done on earth we should have no difficulty in finding that he is directing his work. The Watch Tower is the medium of communication with the various ones who are watchmen and who love the Lord. The Lord has long used it for that purpose. During the year just past The Watch Tower, we believe, has set forth some meat in due season sent from the Lord. Those who so believe study The Watch Tower, not contenting themselves with giving it a mere casual reading. Reports to the office from classes that have conducted Bercan studies in The Watch Tower during the year show much improvement in the condition of these classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower is therefore the official organ for the church, and every really consecrated and anointed child of God is interested in it. Its enemies continue to say much about it; but w</span><span class="font8"><sup>T</sup>e will be content to give no heed to criticism nor be deterred from work thereby, nor even give time to consider the same, believing that the Lord wishes us to use the faculties with which we are endowed, to spread his message. This we will continue</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to do by his grace., and will continue to use The Watch Tower to that end. Of course, the enemy tries to disrupt the work and to prevent the Lord’s people from studying the truth. Such is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year The Watch Tower published an article under the title of “The Birth of the Nation”, showing Satan’s exclusion from heaven, and that from now on until the final conflict he goes forth to make war against those who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. It would therefore be strange if we do not notice some difficulties in some of the classes about various things. Satan is our worst enemy, and we are his sole earthly foe. It is a fight to the finish. The Devil is maliciously bent on doing evil. The watchmen of the Lord are determined always to do good. A closer unity among all the watchmen is had when they study The Watch Tower carefully and try to maintain the spirit of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout the year the Society has followed a world-wide method of spreading the message of the kingdom. Certain witness days have been appointed and all the classes, regardless of what language they speak, have been notified to prepare for that day. This has been done by procuring halls and advertising public meetings. On that fixed day every public speaker, be he pilgrim or elder, has used the same subject in a public lecture. In this manner the watchmen have together lifted up their voices in song; that is to say, they have joyfully proclaimed the same good news everywhere at the same time. This method has been greatly blessed of the Lord. From every country the reports are good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course there are some here and there who decline to use the subject assigned by the Society. But these are few and far between. It is to be expected that there would be some amongst those who claim consecration who would be lawless. The Master foreknew and foretold just such a condition. There are those who think that to be a little contrary shows more fully their independence, and they insist on taking their own course and not working in harmony. These are not watchmen, whatever else they may be. They are not watching for the interests of the kingdom but are watching to gratify their own whims. Nor do these see eye to eye on the great truths now due to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SCOPE OF THE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is manifest that the Lord’s work in giving a witness to his kingdom is now being conducted on a far wider scope than ever before. On the whole there are more people now in present truth in the different countries, speaking the different languages, than heretofore, but a less number actually engaged in the service. Those who are participating are showing greater zeal and energy than heretofore. With them it is not a question as to just when the work will cease and when they may go home, but with all the watchmen joyfully proclaiming the message the question is: Am I doing what - can to show forth the praises of him who has called me out of darkness into the marvelous light ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The scope of the work necessarily increases the correspondence at the headquarters. The Society carries on a voluminous correspondence which has increased during the past year. The president’s office has its share. This includes correspondence with all the foreign countries hereinafter named. Two stenographers are employed in the president’s office to do the work, aside from a large force at the Concord Street office. An effort is made to answer all letters received and to answer them promptly. We ask, however, our brethren to be patient; for at times the work is greater and some parts seem to be more important than to reply to letters.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The policy of the Society has been maintained throughout the year in sending brethren to visit the various classes and to hold public meetings. From the Brooklyn office is conducted all the pilgrim work of the United States, in the English language and in other languages. The attendance at the public meetings generally throughout the year has not increased, and the failure to increase has been due doubtless to the number who have heard over the radio. However the number of meetings and the total attendance throughout the year have shown an increase:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Throughout the year the Society has furnished the handbills for the various public meetings, and on the reverse side of each one has been printed a message of the truth. This expense has been paid by the local classes, and therefore the amount is not reported. This, of course, reduced the contributions to the main office; but neverthrless the money was spent for a witness to the truth. The total number of handbills distributed during the year, which carried on the reverse side a message of truth was, to wit: 10,852,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much joy and doubtless much good has resulted from the conventions held during the year. The large conventions at London, Magdeburg, Springfield, Indianapolis, and other places have heretofore been reported in The Watch Tower. In addition to these, many smaller conventions have been held throughout the country in the English language and many in the foreign tongues. At each one of these conventions a day, or at least a part of a day, was set aside for field service. This has resulted in a tremendous witness for the truth in 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESS BY RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beyond any question of a doubt the witness of the kingdom during 1925 has been the greatest yet given. In addition to the public meetings as above mentioned there have been many radio lectures delivered. The Society owns Station WBBR, Staten Island, which broadcasts, on a wave length of 272.6 meters, every Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Monday evening, Thursday evening and Saturday evening; the hours being, Sunday 10 to 11: 30 a. m., and 9 to 10: 30 p. m., and the other days 8 to 9 p. m. The Society also owns Station WORD, Batavia, Illinois, with an extra studio in Chicago at the Webster Hotel, which broadcasts every evening except Monday, also on Sunday mornings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two stations have been in operation throughout the year, and the reports that come in from week to week are gratifying beyond description. Great numbers of people who would not otherwise have heard the truth, have written these stations, expressing their gratification for the opportunity of learning something about the Bible. People who have heretofore been prejudiced against our Society, because it had been misrepresented to them, after listening to lectures over the radio have not only become friends but many of them have become supporters of the work. A large number of books have been sold to those who have written to the stations. Without doubt this method of giving the testimony concerning the kingdom has the Lord’s blessing. Seemingly he has brought to light this great invention, long ago foretold, just at the proper time to reach a class of people to whom he would have the witness given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Station WBBR has received reports of good reception from Ireland and England, from all of the New England states, Nova Scotia, Ontario, the northern part of the United States, the middle west and the extreme south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Station WORD is one of the super-stations of the United States, operating at 5,000 watts. The reception of this station has been good on both the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, Cuba and the extreme northern part of Alaska. Many who have never before heard of the truth have been interested by hearing this station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The music of these stations is furnished almost exclusively by the consecrated. WBBR has its own orchestra, which receives many compliments from the public. The Lord has greatly blessed the brethren who have arranged the musical programs as well as those who have participated in the lectures, Sunday School lessons, etc. WORD also has its own orchestra, which has given a good account of itself. Both stations also have choral singers who are fully consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In addition to these two stations the Society has recently, together with local brethren, opened at Oakland, California, a radio station with the call letters KFWM, with a wave length of 207 meters, which is on the air every week; also a station at Saskatoon, Sask., known as CHUG, having a wave length of 330 meters. We are watching for opportunities to open other stations, believing it to be the Lord’s will that the message should be spread throughout the land in this way. The Society is asking the brethren everywhere who give public lectures to prepare their lectures in advance, writing them in a clear orderly manner and of a length that will require from twenty to twenty-five minutes to read, and have these ready for use at any time an opportunity affords to use the radio. The Golden Age carries the lectures given by the president of the Society, and any of the brethren are at liberty to use these at other stations at any time the opportunity arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What has been accomplished during the year at Brooklyn, with modesty we say, is gratifying. The Lord is our judge, but it is due to the workers and to the friends in the field to say that Brooklyn renders a good account. The production in the factory has increased over that of 1924 with even a slight reduction in the force at work. The brethren have learned to be more efficient and by the Lord’s grace have accomplished more. In addition to the work done in the office and factory the brethren have spent more time in the field on Saturdays canvassing, and have thus distributed a large amount of literature and have received an increased blessing from the Lord. The output of books for 1925 is 41,515 more than it was in 1924. The output of booklets during 1925 shows an increase of 265,851 over 1924. The Watch Tower and The Golden Age likewise show an increase over 1924. The increase in handbills carrying the message during 1925 over 1924 was 7,036,700. Counting the production of books according to pages as compared with 1924<sub>2</sub> and taking into con-sideratiop the great increase in size of pages of the “Watch Tower Reprints” manufactured, the production at the Brooklyn plant for 1925 is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">This shows an increase in production for 1925 over 1924 of 11,630,937 pieces of literature at Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “Indictments” distributed in all countries and in all languages exceeded 50,000,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Field workers include, of course, pilgrims, colporteurs, class workers, sharpshooters. The colporteurs who give all tffi’ir time to the service accomplish the greatest results, as might be expected. During the year there has been an average of 439 regular colporteurs and 318 auxiliary colporteurs in the field, making an average total of 757 colporteurs. These have placed in the hands of the people Studies in the Scriptures, etc., in bound volumes to the number of 159,655 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year there were 901 classes organized for the service work and 578 sharpshooters enrolled. There has been a weekly average of 1089 workers in this department. During the year these disposed of bound volumes to the number of 168,947, and called on homes to the number of 1,415,875, which shows a decided increase over the previous year. The colporteurs showed an increase of booklet sales in 1925 over 1924 of 44,717, while the class workers showed an increase of 20,182; making a total increase of 67,051 over 1924. There was a net increase in sales of both books and booklets in 1925 over 1924 of 83,036.

<p><span class="font8">In order that the Bethel family might have some part in the distribution of the literature, the factory and the office have been closed on Saturdays from May to September ; and during these months the Bethel Family disposed of 4,596 Harp Bible Study Courses, 350 sets of Studies in the Scriptures, and 17,377 booklets, making a grand total of books and booklets of 24,423. This has been </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> great encouragement to the family, and they have received many blessings therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">week</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">September 7th to 13th was set aside as I. B. S. A. service week. This has proven to be most gratifying. During that week 450 classes engaged in canvassing with the books. They placed in the hands of the people 1085 sets of Studies in the Scriptures and 10,502 </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">Ha</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">rp Bible Study Courses, with other books and booklets, making a grand total of 55,978 volumes. This is proof of the value of united action, all engaging in the same blessed cause on the same day is an encouragement to those who participate; and the Lord adds his blessing. It is impossible here to give a list of all the classes who engaged during Service Week, but the report is made of thirty classes who stand at the head in the service work and who are therefore placed on the honor roll, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD-WIDE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At regular intervals during the year the world-wide witness has been given, and the classes in the United States have responded well. The attendance at these meetings is included in the public meetings in the pilgrim department report. Suffice to say here that these meetings have been a great blessing to those who participated conscious of the fact that they are engaging with their brethren in all languages together lifting up their voices in announcing the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only by the Lord’s grace could such an amount of work be accomplished with such a small amount of money as is used in the service. When brethren are anxious to serve and have the spirit of the Lord, they can, by the Lord’s grace, accomplish something with a little. We are indeed grateful for the amount of finances the Lord has provided during the year. It will be observed that a larger portion of the money contributed by the American brethren was used in European work and in other foreign countries. Canada also furnished a goodly amount. During the year the Society's expenditure in the foreign field amounted to the sum of $159,926.34. In addition thereto, a great amount of literature has been printed for the foreign branches and a great amount printed on the Society’s presses in foreign countries. It is a precious privilege that the brethren of America have in participating in carrying the gospel to the other parts of the world where the friends are too poor in this world’s goods to support the work. The brethren have been liberal in their contributions in so far as the Lord has prospered them.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year the enemy has been busy in his attempt to destroy the Lord’s work. Some who have heretofore been with us have turned aside and joined the enemy, and have had many unkind things to say. But we give no heed to these because we have not the time. It would interrupt our song. Those who really love the Lord and who engage in his service because of their love for him cannot afford to waste time by giving any heed to slander or other opposition reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Looking over the field as a whole, the year 1925 has been the most gratifying of all during the time that it has been the privilege of the Lord’s people to give the witness since the beginning of his presence. It will be found that in some countries there has been a small decrease in the work due to conditions which cannot be overcome; but by far the larger number of countries have shown an increase in the work done and in the amount of good accomplished. When we look at the great amount of work that simply must be done and the small amount that we accomplish in fact, we can appreciate the words of the psalmist, “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.” (Psalm 127:1) We know that our own feeble efforts can accomplish nothing, but the Lord adds his grace and permits his people to accomplish what he desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the Brooklyn headquarters, in addition to the English language the work is carried on in a number of foreign tongues, to wit: Armenian, Arabic, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian. Here a brief report is given of the work done in America in the foreign languages. A more detailed report, however, will be given in The Watch Tower published in these various languages for the benefit of the brethren speaking such languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ABYSSINIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Abyssinia has been very limited, being carried on by correspondence with people of different tongues residing in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA—SOUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in South Africa during the year has increased very much and to the gratification of those who have had part in it. The main part of the work, of course, is under the Society’s headquarters at Cape Town, but the witness has been extended into Anatonga-land, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Cape Good Hope, Madagascar, Natal, Orange Free State, Portuguese East Africa, Rhodesia, South West Africa, Swaziland, Transvaal, and Zululand. During the year our printing press at Cape Town has been put to good use, and has furnished a great amount of free literature. The Harp and several of the booklets have been published in the Dutch and also in some of the native tongues, and have had a goodly distribution. In addition, about 250,000 pieces of free literature have been printed and distributed to the people. This witness in South Africa is gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The local manager reports that 1925 has been the banner year for the work in South Africa, that the meetings held and the amount of books and literature placed in the hands of the people is three times greater than any previous year in the history of the harvest. The sale of books amounted to approximately 50,000. The population is very scattered, and this necessitates a large amount of traveling to reach the people. The classes have been organized for the service work and have been carrying this on to good advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA—WEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord continues to bless the work of his people in the West Coast of Africa, as shown by the following:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font7">Volumes of books sold</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font7">Public meetings held</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font7">Free literature distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brother Brown, the local manager, writes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Six months’ rain in this country has impeded the work somewhat; but the output of the books exceeded that of last year, and the witness has been extended far and wide along the West Coast of Africa, a distance of over two thousand miles. This country is far behind in this twentieth century; and much hardship is encountered in traveling, lodgings, food, etc. Also much money spent. But the joy of the Lord is our strength; and soon the people will realize what the Lord has done for them through his channel, the Watch Tower Bibijc and Tract Society. Without doubt the Babylonish churches here have suffered from the effects of the truth. The people are seeing the truth, and many are withdrawing from Babylon. Our public lectures are well attended, and the people like to hear about the kingdom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In September a convention was held in Freetown, Sierra Leone, at which the brethren from various parts of West Africa were present. This convention was addressed by nine different brethren, and brought much joy to all who attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, the witness in Albania has been limited. The Harp of God, also The Desirable Government and The World Distress booklets were translated and printed in the native, tongue, a goodly number placed in the hands of the people, and the Albanians are taking hold of the truth with much joy. There are only three classes in Albania, but they are doing good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Argentine Republic is a very large territory; and to cover it all with the force at hand is a very great task. Nevertheless, the brethren there are going on with the work. Brother Muniz is in charge of the Spanish work, while Brother Charles Ott and Brother Max Gumpel are working amongst the German population. During the year books have been sold and pieces of free literature have been distributed to the number of 279,944. A number of classes have been formed in different places, small in number; but their zeal for the Lord is manifest. The work is making slow but certain progress; and the witness is being given. Of course, the work must be entirely financed from the main office at Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ASIA MINOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dnder this head we include the work in Armenia, Syria, Turkey, Georgia, and Arabia. The interest in this part of the field has increased during the past year. There have been five new Armenian classes organized, and public meetings held to the number of 65 with a total attendance of 4,500. Class meetings held 87, with an attendance of 2,762. Books sold 876 volumes, and other pieces of literature distributed 5,520. Letters received 326, and dispatched 488.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In that same part of the world is another class of Syrians using the Arabic tongue. At Mt. Lebanon there is a class of upwards of 70, and many more manifesting considerable interest and the message is spreading throughout the country. These brethren in Asia Minor also have been extending the work by correspondence to Bulgaria, Egypt, the Island of Cyprus, Abyssinia, Persia and other parts of the East and even reaching some in the Far East, Asia. At least, we are able to say that there has been a witness concerning God’s kingdom given to the truth in Abyssinia, Arabia, Armenia, and Persia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALASIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The giving of the witness of the kingdom in Australasia goes majestically on under the direction of the King of kings. There is a decided increase of interest manifested by the people in the year just past. In order to get the report for the fiscal year to Brooklyn in time it was closed earlier; namely, only eleven months of the year being shown. We quote fram the Australasian report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have closed the books this year at the end of August, so this report covers only eleven months. Despite the shorter period, we are well ahead of last year’s output. We have well nigh cleaned out our stock of volumes. The number of colporteurs in the field has fluctuated somewhat during the year. Some of the dear ones have had to withdraw from the service for various reasons, while others have availed themselves of the opportunity to give their whole time l:&gt; the Lord’s service, so that the number remains about the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pilgrim work during the year is especially gratifying. This has almost doubled over the year of 1924. The successive world witnesses held during the year of 1925 have aroused considerable interest amongst the brethren of boili Australia and New Zealand; and the Lord’s message has been widely proclaimed, even more than heretofore. In consequence there is greater interest on the part of the public and more opposition. The D.D’s and smaller puppies are barking furiously. The brethren much appreciate the opportunities of service, and they highly appreciate the meat in due season appearing in The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Literature circulated in Australasia during the year:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In view of the large expanse of territory and the small population in proportion, the work done in Australasia during the year shows remarkable results, better than any previous year. We rejoice with our Australian brethren at this increased zeal on their part and the manifestation of the Lord’s blessing toward them. Each letter from the Australasian office brings a fresh request for the President of the Society to visit that country, but press of work in America and in other places is such that it hardly seems reasonable to spare the time to make the long journey. It is a great joy to cooperate with the brethren in the far an ay countries as well as with those nearby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As is well known by the Watch Tower readers, Austria for centuries has been largely predominated by the Catholics. Little opportunity has been had there for witnessing for the kingdom message, but during the past year there has been a great increase in the work in that laud. The people are quite poor, and it is difficult for them to buy books; but with all these handicaps there has been sold and placed in the hands of the people in Austria in the past year the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures The Harp ok God Comfort for the People &quot;Indictments” distributed free</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">1,170,000</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">In recent months the service work has been organized in Austria, and there has been a decided increase. the work has taken on a new impetus and bids fair to greatly increase within the next few months. The following is a quotation from a report from Austria:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general convention at Vienna, of which I am enclosing a program, has spurred on the ecclesias in Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are observing here that the Jewish people in Zionism now find the spirit of grace and supplication. Some of the brethren in working from house to house amongst the Jews at Vienna since January meet with a quite different success than two years ago; the Jews are commencing to wake up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR THE BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brother having charge of this work reports: &quot;The blind are more appreciative of literature prepared for them than are the seeing people. The work during the year has increased over that of last year.” The Revised Braille is the American method used for preparing literature for the blind. The Society has literature for the blind as follows: The Harp of God, Desirable Government, Comfort for the People, various articles in The Watch Tower, and prayer-meeting text comments. The Millions book is prepared in the English Braille. These volumes are loaned to blind readers. The brethren everywhere can encourage the work cf the blind by calling on the blind people who would be glad to read the literature, and by communicating to this office information obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Bolivia the witness during the year has consisted of the distribution of free literature and the placing of a few books. The people in that land do not take very much to religious matters, but we rejoice to say that there has been some witness to the truth there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The w’ork in Brazil is conducted from the Society’s office at Rio de Janeiro. The work is chiefly amongst the Portuguese people. The Watch Tower is published in the Portuguese language, as this is the principal language spoken by the people in that vicinity; and in addition to this, of course, there is some work done amongst the English-speaking people. The Society has recently installed a printing press which we expect to use in printing much of the free literature in the near future. During the year 175,000 pieces of literature have been distributed free of charge in Brazil. The people in that land a i'o not much disposed to spend their money. While a limited number buy the books, it is much easier to get them to read something that is free. The work, of course, for Brazil must be financed from the main office at Brooklyn. The local representative’s report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother spent five months on a trip which covered the important points on the coast and up the Amazon River. He had many wonderful experiences. In some places he had the opportunity of addressing congregations of Protestants, but generally they were notified in advance that a heretic was on the way. He sold a number of books, however. Another brother distributed tracts in Minas Geraes. About 30,000 were put out at Sao Paulo; and other towns were also canvassed and tracts distributed. The friends are receiving many blessings from the Lord and are continuing firm in .the faith. The little class of Hungarians in Sao Paulo are of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font7">courage and are doing well. About all that can be expected to be done in this dark country is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">give the people the witness concerning the kingdom, in fulfilment of the Lord’s commandment.—Matthew 24: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Brazil is making satisfactory progress, for which we are very grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By the term British, as herein used, we mean the countries of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which are under the jurisdiction of the London office. The witness given during 1925 in these countries has surpassed that of any previous year. It will be gratifying to note that a greater number of books on the truth, Scripture Studies, etc., have been placed by the British office this year than in any previous year during the harvest period. The annual report submitted by Brother Ilemery, the manager of the British work, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have again the privilege and honor to send you the British Branch yearly report. The past year has been one of unceasing aclivitj in the service of our Lord, our King; and the zeal of the brethren Is reflected in the increase in the number of books sold, which the report shows. We could have wished for a still better report; for though there is a good showing and an increase over last year of 160,000 books, the increase is much more in the smaller than in the larger books. Large as these figures are, I believe they are yet to be greatly exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In some districts the lack of money owing to unemployment makes it almost impossible to sell the larger books; during the past year the government has paid out £100,000,000 in umm ployment relief. The fact that the books are being sold shoos the people want to hear of affairs. The service work does well, though not all the classes are active. Some of the classes are very small, and do not enter into their privileges as they might do. But this applies also to some of the larger classes. The service work has taken up a total of 292,189 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The colporteur work is lively; and to these dear brethren who day by day and throughout the year go forth serving the Lord, our hearts go out. There are 167 whole-time colporteurs, and these with the 96 auxiliaries have accounted for 173,610 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A summary of the British work is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies, all kinds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104,837</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The British report continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have held 2490 public meetings, and have distributed folders to advertise them, every one carrying some message of the truth, to the number of 8,993,000. The attendance of strangers at the meetings was 139,042.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pilgrim service lias been much enjoyed by the classes; 2769 visits are reported, besides 625 visits made by auxiliary service, chiefly class elders who serve on appointments from the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The British friends were much heartened by your, visit; It left a deep and abiding impression on their minds, and has been effective In the furtherance of the work. I am extremely glad to be able to report the enthusiasm of the brethren, and that there was never so much unity of heart and mind in the British field as at present True there are still some who believe they have a right to conduct the Lord’s harvest work in their own way apart from the lead of the Society. It is not these that have contributed to the increased numbers in this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year there has been considerable literature distributed in Bulgaria. One brother has traveled and held meetings there during the year with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is indeed gratifying to note that every branch of the work in Canada shows an increase in 1925 over 1924, which at that time was the banner year. A large portion of Canada is prairie country, thinly settled; and as it is difficult to give public witnesses and reach many people, the system of holding meetings at public schools has been adopted with very gratifying results. During the year meetings have been held at 526 different school houses in Canada, with a total attendance of 12,375, at which books were placed in the hands of the people to the number of 9,860. It is understood, of course, that this work is confined to Western Canada, known as the prairie country. It is hoped to extend this branch of the work to the other parts of Canada in the near future. During the year there have been 9 pilgrims devoting all their time to the sendee in Canada, besides 12 auxiliary pilgrims; and much local work has been done by brethren of the various classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following is given of the Canadian work for 1925:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Public meetings held &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,245</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Total number of pieces of literature sold 276,449 Free literature distributed, including</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Indictments’' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,382,052</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The colporteur work in Canada during the year shows splendid results. There were 71 colporteurs in the field, which is an increase of 18 over last year. The report of Brother Salter, the Canadian representative, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite the fact that there has been a considerable falling off in sales for the months of August and September as compared with the corresponding months last year, I am happy to report that the total sales for the year are in excess of last year by 4740 pieces, the total for the year being 276,449. There has been a healthy increase in the number of colporteurs, there being an average of 71 in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An outstanding witness of the year was made through the distribution of the “Indictments”, both in the English and French languages, and also in the message upon the back of our dodgers, which have been so largely used this year. The total number of pieces distributed was 2,382,052, which is 454,709 in excess of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The attendance at meetings this year has been very gratifying indeed; that of the public totaling 179,084, while that of the classes was 103.406, making a grand total of 282,400. This attendance has been the result of the service of nine pilgrim brethren of English, German and Ukrainian languages, and twelve auxilaries serving week-end appointments. The mileage, as you will note, has been very heavy, totaling 1S0.647 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pilgrim service has included that of Newfoundland, the reports to hand from the pilgrims serving there being to the effect that while it is a very difficult country to serve, the interest among the Newfoundlanders is very keen. The number of consecrated there, however, is small and very scattered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have had another very successful year in witnessing in the province of Quebec. The sale of literature has not been quite so high as last year; but a very thorough distribution of the “Indictment” was made, as well as that of other literature, with much persecution as a result. Many of the brethren were cast into prison, but in all cases arrangements were made for them to be bailed out, and the cases fpught in the courts. I am happy to say that in each and every instance the cases have been dismissed; and I believe that as a consequence the Catholic priesthood will be less inclined to molest them in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pleased indeed am I to report that the spiritual condition of the Lord’s people throughout Canada seems to be excellent. There are very few classes where there is any evidence of contention or division. On the contrary all the friends seem to be united in action as never before. They have more fully than ever before entered into the joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now I would like to take advantage of this opportunity of assuring you of my deepest Christian love and loyalty in the cause of our King, and at the same time to assure you that you are held in the highest esteem and love of the friends throughout this land, being continually remembered by us, one and all, at the throne of grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CANAL ZONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work here is organized and conducted under the direction of the Brooklyn office and has had a healthy increase during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As heretofore announced, the Society during the World War established a central office in Switzerland, through which it conducts its work in the other countries of Central Europe, to wit: Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Austria, Czecl.o-Slovakia, and Germany. Germany's work is now independent of the Central European office. The Central European office acts more in the nature of a clearing house for the benefit of the other countries. For some time this has been under the direction of Brother Binkele. Brother Bmkele's physical condition has been such in the past few months that he has been relieved of his duties, and Brother Zaugg is at present in charge. All these countries, however, communicate direct with the home office in Brooklyn and are under the management of the Brooklyn headquarters. The books and other literature for all the countries above named aside from Germany have been published largely in the Central European office at Berne, Switzerland. In addition to this, other of our literature is printed there for parts of Southern Europe. The reports of the various countries appear under the respective heads of said countries, but it is interesting here to note that the countries above mentioned with the exclusion of Germany, have held meetings as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Total lectures &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,846</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Total attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;455,230</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brethren have traveled through Chile during the year, and have distributed a large amount of free literature and placed some books, and have been telling the people concerning the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year some effort was made to give the witness in this benighted land but with little success. A few meetings were held and some books placed. Probably the Lord is not ready to take his message of truth to these people. We know, however, that the time will come when they must learn that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COLORED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our colored brethren have been doing splendid work during the year. The sale of books is included, of course, in the general report. This branch is carried on not for the purpose of segregation; but because it is believed that through a separate branch the public can be reached in a better way and because it affords an opportunity for our colored brethren to develop as speakers and to serve more efficiently. There are four pilgrims in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work here is progressing very -well under the management of the local office directed from Brooklyn, and a good witness has been maintained during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several meetings were held in Cuba during the year. A brother was sent there from Jamaica to hold some meetings, and also a brother from America on another occasion. There are several zealous brethren in Cuba. They are arranging for a convention there soon, and are carrying the message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECH O-SLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are only a few in Czecho-Slovakia who are consecrated; but these have been putting forth their best efforts during the past year to give the witness. They have placed in the hands of the people the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;327</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Harp of God &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,248</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.597</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Indictments” distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;262,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work here is really just beginning to take on an impetus. Like other Central European countries, it is financed by the American office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people of Czecho-Slovakia have begun to realize that John Huss was a martyr to the cause of righteousness; and recently an emblem to the memory of Huss ■was raised in that land. The pope severed the relationship of the Vatican with Czecho-Slovakia immediately. This will open the way for the people to get their minds in a better condition to receive the truth, and we anticipate a greater spread of the truth in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reference is also made to the Northern European office. The report from Denmark shows an increase in the work over last year. Eleven colporteurs in the field have been doing good work under difficulties. The service work amongst the classes has been recently reorganized. The report from Denmark says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several classes have now taken up the service work with enthusiasm and a number of others will join soon. The number of classes is increasing and the work progressing, although conditions are not so favorable as in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Books have been distributed by the Danish brethren as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year three Greek brethren spent some time in Egypt visiting particularly the cities of Alexandria, Port Said, and Cairo. A number of meetings were held which were largely attended; and quite a good amount of literature was placed among the Greek-speaking people in that country and some amongst the natives, who are mostly Mohammedans and few of whom have any interest in the Bible. Nevertheless, the witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost every item of the work in Finland shows an increase over that of last year. During the world-wide witness meetings, a total of 598 meetings were held -with an attendance of 58,351. Thirty conventions were held during the year, all of which were highly appreciated and many blessings resulted. The distribution of literature in Finland during the year has been as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Harp of God</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The greater amount of this work has been done in the past few months after the reorganization of the work under the general direction of the Northern European office, managed by Brother Dey. Brother Harteva, the local manager of the Finnish work says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a great joy for us all to have Brother Dey. The dear Lord directed you in arranging matters in this way. The work shows that the Lord is manifesting his approval of this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE AND BELGIUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In these countries the Society does not maintain an office for the French-speaking people, because this work is conducted from the Society’s office at Berne, Switzerland. Neither the French nor the Belgians are much given to religious matters, but during the past year there has been a decided increase in interest manifested in these countries. French books have been sold as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Hasp of God &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11,498</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Many public meetings have been held, and much interest manifested. The Golden Age in French has a large circulation in Belgium, France, and Switzerland. During the year there have been placed French copies of The Golden Age to the amount of 273,335.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Germany has gone forward during the last twelve months, greatly to the joy of the consecrated and to the Lord’s glory. In every department of the work in Germany, there is an increase over any previous year. The Society now owns a large printing plant and bookbinding establishment there, and has recently erected a new building and has installed more machinery, which will make the capacity of the plant equal to or even greater than the one at Brooklyn. The Lord has wonderfully opened the way for the spreading of the truth in Germany, and we hope to do much publishing in Germany for other coutries of Europe. During the recent visit of the President of the Society to Germany additional property was purchased for the purpose of extending the plant. The local manager, Brother Bal-zereit, in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It now begins to appear how advantageous It was to purchase the property which was purchased on your last visit. We now know clearly, as you at I he time at once perceived, the whole situation and the advantages of purchasing this property for the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As compared with the work of 1924 the same has almost doubled in 1925. The following is a summary of literature distributed and the meetings held in Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scbiptubes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;288,914</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The report from the German office continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The result of the service work is very delightful; and everywhere we receive letters from the brethren, saying that they have much joy in doing this work. The pilgrim service has considerably increased. There are now 101 new classes in Germany to be visited by the pilgrims. Besides this, the pilgrims now visit Austria and Czecho-SIovakia. There are 23 pilgrims in the regular service all the time, and 6 part of the time. During the year the subscriptions to The Watch Tower increased 8,000 and the subscriptions to The Gowen Age. 65,000. The Society also maintains 9 shipping depots in different parts of Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The manufacture of books and booklets and the printing of the other matters at the Society’s printing plant in Germany during the year is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Books and booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,778 000</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Heretofore the work in Germany has come within the jurisdiction of the Central European office; but the German office has become so important that it has been relieved from that standing, and is now under the direct supervision of the Brooklyn office, without the necessity of reporting to the Central European office. The arrangement to work through the Central European office was made because of the war, but that does not now seem to be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Greece has progressed in splendid form during the year. Our books were banned by the government, but some were circulated anyhow until the matter was brought before the courts. After a hearing the ban was removed. The books have gone out to the number of about 30,000 during the year. Free tract distribution has reached a million, and a great many homes have been visited, and the interest continues to increase throughout the land. The Greek government has foibidden lectures to be given, but our brethren continue to give them and the crowds are great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The friends in Hawaii continue to prosecute the witness work and with good success. One colporteur sells on an average of 300 books per week chiefly to the Japanese and Filipino plantations. Also a number of books are placed among the native Hawaiians. The friends are making progress and rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HOLLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society maintains a headquarters in Holland. Not a great many in Holland have ever been interested in the truth to the point of really becoming active in the Lord’s service. A Hollander moves a good deal with the rapidity of an ox-cart. However, the few really consecrated ones in Holland during the past year have accomplished some splendid work, and there is a decided increase in the number of the really consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year our Hollandish brethren have placed:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark32"><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Sciuptubes</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark33"><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Hakp of God</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">10,087</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Indictments” distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;512,900</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark34"><span class="font7">ScENABlOS</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark35"><span class="font7">Mu.lions</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font8">This makes a total of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">21,197</span><span class="font8"> books and booklets distributed, besides many Bibles and other literature. During the year the attendance at the Photo-Drama of Creation was 14,000. Three brethren have engaged in the pilgrim work, and have delivered 13 public lectures in different cities and held 117 class meetings. In addition to the above there have been free tracts distributed to the number of 512,000 throughout Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Hungary has been greatly retarded during the year by opposition; but the brethren have held 28!) meetings with an attendance of 9,297. Several colporteurs have been at work and distributed a large amount of literature. We have been trying to remove some of the difficulties so as to put the work in better shape in Hungary, but have been unable to do so up to this time. Only the Lord can hold back the adversary from interfering. The matter is in the Lord’s hands, and our Hungarian brethren are doing their best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in India lias continued during the year, and there has been a slight increase over 1924. Besides the English language, literature and books have been put out in three different native dialects, to wit: Singhalese, Tamil, and Malayalam. It seems that we should have a wider witness in India; and yet the Lord continues to bless the efforts that are put forth and the work goes steadily on. The people who really take to the truth are very poor, and the work must be financed from the home office. The reports during the year from India, however, are quite encouraging; and we rejoice that the Lord is still blessing the efforts there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is difficult to do as much in Italy as we do in some other countries. However, the work there is considerably greater than it was last year. The organization is in better shape and condition, and the brethren are zealous for the Lord and his cause. Many meetings have been held with one general convention, which was attended by Brother Macmillan during his visit to the Near East. Our Italian brethren distributed 100,000 copies of the “Indictment”; and they particularly saw to it that the pope and the other high officials of the Vatican each received a copy. The local manager says: “We thought the ‘Indictment’ would cause persecution, but the clergy swallowed the pill without breathing.” A summary of the work in Italy follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Books distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11,280</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Free literature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140,000</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark36"><span class="font7">Public meetings</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark38"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Letters received</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark39"><span class="font7">Letters dispatched</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report from Jamaica is favorable. The enemy has tried to interrupt the work there but without success. The loyal ones are happy and are pushing on with the witness. Books and booklets distributed during the year are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Books and booklets sold &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32,145</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark40"><span class="font7">Pilgrims in the service</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark41"><span class="font7">Public meetings</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark43"><span class="font7">Letters received</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark44"><span class="font7">Letters dispatched</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brethren there express their gratitude for the assistance received from the United States. The worldwide witness meetings have been a great blessing to them in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a small congregation friends at Suma, Kobe, Japan, who continue in the best way they can to give the witness in Japanese. The Japanese work on the Pacific Ccast in the United States has taken on a considerable impetus during the year, classes being organized in several places. We hope shortly to send a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8">apanese brother to Japan to assist in the work there. Millions, Comfort, Harp of God and Volume One of Studies in the Scriptures are in the Japanese language. A brother from Japan writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">False teachers are planning to leave Japan. Really what these so-called missionaries have effected in our country is desecration of home and national unity, desecration of the name of the Lord and of a hope of life eternal. They have done this in the name of Jesus. Our people have rejected these, and there is now a possibility of their accepting the truth when presented to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several brethren in this country have been quite active during the year, and have made a good witness by the distribution of free literature and the circulation of a goodly number of books and booklets among the common people. They hear the truth gladly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There has been no particular increase in the work in. Korea during the year, but the brethren continue zealously and earnestly doing the work the best they can in giving the witness. Our little printing plant there continues to operate, and produces some literature for the Koreans and the Chinese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LITHUANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lithuania has begun to wake up. During the year considerable literature has been shipped from our office to two different points in that country. Some local brethren are doing well in distributing this and placing the books in the hands of the people. One pilgrim brother was sent from America this year; and in cooperation with others in Lithuania the work there is getting well started. The meetings held are well attended and the witness is being given. The following is quoted from a brother’s letter from there: “Great numbers are crying out for more literature. I have sold all I had.” We immediately dispatched a large shipment of literature upon receipt of this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MEXICO</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those interested in Mexico are the Spanish-speaking people. This work is conducted from the United States. During the year the Mexican friends were visited by a brother from the United States and held a convention. This greatly encouraged them, and they are pushing on in giving the witness in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Sweden has not been satisfactory for some time. Constant complaints came from the Swedish friends that the local manager was not giving proper consideration to the work but was trying to carry out his own selfish purposes. A convention was held in Orebro in May, attended by about 500 friends; and when they were told that the Society had decided to organize a Northern European office having jurisdiction over Sweden and other countries, and that Brother Dey of London would be in charge, they unanimously expressed their appreciation and approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This office has been established at Copenhagen and Brother Dey of London is in charge and the countries embraced are Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Esthonia, Latvia and other states along the Baltic Sea. Only three and a half months now has this office been in operation. During that time Brother Dey has traveled 9,000 miles in the different countries, held many meetings and organized the service work as it is carried on in America; and he reports great increase of activity on the part of the friends and increased interest on the part of the people. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Already in Sweden sets of eight volumes are going out. At the convention held in all these countries many brethren took part in the service work for the first time; and it was the unanimous opinion of all that Service Pay was the best day of the whole convention. The joy of the Lord was manifest on their faces. Everywhere the friends have warmly welcomed me, and the Northern European ofhce is recognized as being of the Lord’s arrangement. Much work remains to be done and the brethren are in good heart to do it. I hope to make a tour of Lithuania, Latvia, and Esthonia in November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The increased enthusiasm of the brethren in the countries covered by the Northern European office is an evidence of the Lord’s approval of this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is gratifying to report increased interest in the Norwegian work, particularly the last few months. The sale of books has increased, also attendance at the meetings and likewise interest generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Norway and is beginning to show splendid results. See also the above report of the Northern European office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There has not been any great increase of the work in Palestine during the year. The class at Ramallah continues to hold together and to encourage each other, and occasionally a new one comes to the truth. There are now several brethren in Jerusalem. We do not expect much in Palestine yet. But surely there will be more to do as soon as the message is ready to be delivered to the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PARAGUAY AND PATAGONIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year there has been considerable free literature distributed in these countries, but there are no organized classes thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The little class in the Philippine Islands continues to meet together and study the Lord’s Word. They are doing a limited amount of witnessing to others, and there has been some slight increase in the numbers who attend. That the message is held forth in the Philippine Islands we are glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would seem passing strange if the Lord’s work got on without some interruptions. We do not expect it to move along without some difficulties. Occasionally the adversary gets the better of one who is put into a position of responsibility. This has been true in Poland. The brother who was sent there a few years ago as the Society’s representative yielded to the influence of the adversary, and became wise in his own conceit, and attempted to start an arrangement of his own and cooperate with some other opposition. This, however, has not materially injured the work. The Society sent a brother from the Brooklyn office last winter, who spent several months in Poland; and now the work is in much better shape than at any time last year. The attendance at the classes is better, the interest of the public is better, and it is the pleasure of the Society to report that the Polish work is now in better shape than at any other time in Poland. There are now’ 9 pilgrims on the list rendering service. These during the year made 457 visits. Meetings were held as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The clergy succeeded in inducing the political authorities to prevent the “Indictments” from being put out in Poland. During the year 11 conventions were held, which greatly strengthened the brethren and encouraged them to go on with renewed energy in the Lord’s service. The Polish brethren in America have nobly put forth their efforts to help the work in Poland. This of course has been done through the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Economic conditions are very bad in Poland. Many who must labor for a living, including our brethren, earn approximately $3.50 per week; and out of this small amount they must get their food and raiment for themselves and for their families. This makes it very difficult for the Polish people to buy books; and we must supply them with much free literature if they get some knowledge of the kingdom and its blessings. It has been the privilege of those who have had some means to comfort others who had little or none. Great interest is manifest in the truth. The meetings in Poland are attended by thousands who are becoming interested, and it is not even necessary to advertise as we would in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POLISH WORK IN FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As heretofore stated in The Watch Tower, there has been a large migration from Poland to the coal fields of France. The Society has been doing a large amount of work amongst these. During the year there has been about </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">12</span><span class="font8"> classes organized, and now there are about 800 consecrated of the Polish brethren residing in Northern France. A number of these engage in the service work at such time as they can; and they distributed a large amount of literature, books, booklets, etc., during the year. The Golden Age is published in the Polish language and is circulated widely amongst the Polish people in Northern France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Report has already been made through these columns of how the Lord graciously opened the door to enter Portugal and Spain. The work there during the year is truly remarkable. All praise and glory to our God and to our Savior Christ Jesus! In Portugal, the Millions book has been published, also Hell, Can the Living Talk with the Dead; and now The Watch Tower is published and sent out regularly every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Free literature distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;827,500</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark52"><span class="font7">Letters received</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font7">letters dispatched</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark54"><span class="font7">Booklets sold</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother and his wife from South America are now in Portugal to take care of the local work. Quoting from the report of the Society's representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your Lisbon lecture was used of the Lord in a truly wonderful manner. The reproduction of the discourse in the public press created great interest not only throughout Portugal but also throughout the Portuguese colonies. Since then the work has gone steadily forward, and the Jubilee trumpet is sounding where it has never sounded before. The hosts of Midian are afraid. By careful distribution the volunteer literature has been distributed throughout practically every city and town in Portugal; also throughout Funchal, the Cape Verde Islands, Mozambique, Portuguese Fast Africa, Portuguese West Africa and the Portuguese possessions in tile Indian Ocean. Hundreds of letters of appreciation and orders for books have been received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROUMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From Cluj the work of Roumania and Hungary is directed. The interference with the work by the state has been great there during the year. Nothwithstanding, there have been 9 pilgrims in the service regularly while 10 others have served part of the time, besides 7 local pilgrims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meetings held &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,267</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88,066</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the difficulties are beginning to be removed and we have great hopes of the Lord’s lifting the ban so that we may proceed with a wider service in Roumania. A report from there reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite the fact that we have passed through the most severe shaking and trials that ever occurred amongst the Lord’s people in this country, the unity and love of the brethren toward the Lord and each other was not affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only by the Lord’s grace could the witness have been given in Spain. The door seemed to be absolutely and completely closed. Suddenly it opened, by the Lord’s grace and power. Now The Watch Tower is published in the Spanish language in Madrid, and it starts off with 300 subscribers. After the second month the interest continues to increase. We have published over 10,000 volumes of the Millions book, and 5,000 copies of the Spanish Harp of God have just been completed. There have been distributed 247,000 copies of tracts. Circulars and letters dispatched total 2,540. The Society now has an office in Madrid, Spain, and from the local representative’s report we quote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The public proclamation of the kingdom message in Spain commenced with your lectures in Barcelona and Madrid, May 10th and 11th. At that time, like the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet, the proclamation “The kingdom of heaven is at hand” began to go forth. As St. Paul witnessed in Spain in the closing years of the Jewish harvest, so likewise it almost seems significant that the message, The kingdom of heaven is at hand, should be proclaimed in the same country in the closing years of the gospel harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord manifested his special approval of the proclamation of this message, and in one w’ay or another hindered the printing and distribution of any other tracts until the special Spanish Watch Tower containing this message had gone out. Then and not till then were we able to get out the “Where are the Dead” tracts. Since then the kingdom message has been distributed throughout every city and town in Spain, also throughout the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and the principal towns In the Spanish Zone in Morocco. Many letters of appreciation are coming in daily, and about 300 have subscribed to the SpaniaM Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reference is made to the report of the Northern European office, showing reorganization in Sweden. A new local manager, Brother J. Eneroth, is in charge under the supervision of Brother Dey. A report from that office is to the effect that since the reorganization the friends are entering into the work with much joy. The following figures cover only the last three months of the fiscal year, July 1st to September 30th:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">We rejoice with our brethren in Sweden that the work continues to increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Switzerland is the smallest republic on earth, but it is really doing much active work in giving the witness of the kingdom. A comparison between 1919 and 1925 will be of interest to the friends at this time. In 1919, in all of Switzerland there were less than 100 consecrated; in 1925 there are upwards of 3,000 consecrated. In 1919 the office of the Society occupied two rooms in a private home; in 1920 a small printing plant was started and some property purchased. In 1924 the construction of a new building began. Now the Society' owns two large buildings on opposite sides of the street, connected by a tunnel under the street through which are drawn trucks that carry the material and finished products of the bookbinding establishment. The new structure is complete and machinery installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1919, the Society had throe brethren engaged in the work in Switzerland. Today there are approximately 100 at the headquarters. In the small country of Switzerland for the year 1925, volumes of books, etc., were sold and distributed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures, Harps, etc., 118.740 Booklets, “Comport” and like size &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;366,026</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Indictments” distributed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;751,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society maintains a book manufacturing plant at Berne, Switzerland. Here are printed all books, booklets and other papers for Central Europe outside of Germany. During the year there have been produced at this plant 1,457,000 volumes of books. In addition to this were produced magazines and pamphlets, etc., to the number of 9,449,333, making a total of books, pamphlets, magazines, etc., of 10,906,333; total pages of volume size 342,582,766.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were held in Switzerland during the year 338 public meetings with a total attendance of 45,060. Other meetings held, private and semi-private 564, with an attendance of 53,419.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Switzerland is under the supervision of the Central European office; and, as stated elsewhere in this report, the finances for conducting the work in Central Europe are furnished chiefly by the home office in Brooklyn. None of these countries has been able to carry on the work unaided. The brethren of America and Canada may take some consolation in the fact that their contributions to the work at the headquarters in Brooklyn have served to carry on the work in Central Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD </span><span class="font7">(Port of Spain)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The local manager for the Port of Spain reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Books and booklets distributed during the year 7,490; class meetings held 3,315; attendance 51,926; public meetings held 155; attendance 15,476. The brethren are in good spiritual condition. They look forward with appreciation and eagerness to the meat in due season which the Lord so bountifully and regularly supplies through the columns of The Watch Tower, and a great majority of them rejoice in the opportunities of service afiorded by the world-wide witnesses and the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no branch office in Turkey, but a number of tracts are issued, and the witness is carried into that country in a limited degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UKRAINIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother was sent from America this year to the Ukrainians in Europe; and while he has been prevented from getting into that part controlled by Russia, much good work has been done amongst the Ukrainians in that part controlled by Poland. There has been a great and increasing demand for literature there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">URUGUAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The witness has been given in Uruguay this year by a goodly distribution of free tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VENEZUELA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother sent from Port of Spain, Trinidad, into Venezuela during the year with 35,000 copies of free literature, visited the principal cities of Venezuela and distributed these. In his report he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tracts were well received. The people manifested much interest and were anxious to get the books. I am sure the tracts have had a good effect and I have had the assurance that they are being widely read by the Venezuelans and favorably received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For lack of space this report must be brief. A full report would require several issues of The Watch Tower. Great is the work and few are the laborers, but the Lord is at the helm and will carry on to a completion. The tide of truth is rising. The message goes majestically on. The watchmen rejoice. Let no one discourage you. This is the Lord’s work and marvelous in our eyes. Let everyone who has been put on watch be loyal, be faithful, be true. All together now, lift up the voice with joy and harmoniously sing together the song of Moses and the Lamb. The kingdom of heaven is at hand! Praise ye the Lord 1</span></p>

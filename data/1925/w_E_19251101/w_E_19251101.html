<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Extension”, now being </span><span class="font6">presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not diily serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached -with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very-helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font6"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, . . . to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3 : 5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our leaders to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 :16, 17 ; Ephesians 2 : 20-22 ; Genesis 28 :14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font6">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font6"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.-—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tnat the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace ; to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24 : 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font6">Acts 3 :19-23 ; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A CALL TO ACTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isaiah 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font9">T SEEMS to please the Lord from time to time to show his people what he desires them to do. His promise is: “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Proverbs 4: 18) This promise he is fulfilling to his people. Surely this increased light is not merely for the purpose of permitting the saints to bask in its beauty and feast upon its radiance, but it is also to show them what the Lord would &quot;have them do, that his great name may be honored.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When first we knew the Lord our chief thought was that some sweet day we would go to heaven and there spend eternity in bliss. That hope has not been dimmed, but we find also there is something further to do before the last members enter into the realms of boundless rapture. God has called his people for a purpose, which </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font9">to show forth his praises. One of the ways of doing </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font9">is joyfully to be his witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The church, by virtue of its Head, is a part of the great Melchizedek priesthood, which is the executive officer of the Most High to carry out his purposes. Faithfulness now in the performance of duty gives assurance that in the ages to come these saints shall be the recipients of the exceeding riches of God’s grace through Jesus Christ, their Head.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In the past it has been the thought of some Christians that our course is to be negative or non-resistant; but now as we step into the open rays of the light of a new day we see that there is much for the church to do. Zion is God’s organization. Out from her is born the nation, of which Jesus is the Head, and which shall rule and bless the peoples of earth. Her children shall be the teeming millions which in God’s due time shall fill the earth with peace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The time has come for the establishment of Zion, when, she shall take her position of authority and glory </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font9">ever. Satan is cast out of heaven and is now confining his wicked works to the earth, making a desperate attempt to destroy those who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. But those saints who dwell in the secret place of the Most High realize their security from all harm. To Zion the mighty God now says: “Violence shall no more be heard </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">thy land, wasting </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font9">destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.”—Isaiah 60: 18, 19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>G</sup> The temple class has entered into the joy of the Lord; and from this time forward they that press the fight positively and with vigor, in the name and in the strength of the Lord, shall overcome and gain the laurels of eternal victory. Now these hear the commands of the Lord and his commands are sweet music to their ears. Among these heart-cheering commands are the words of God’s prophet Isaiah: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isaiah 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> A gate is a means of passage or a way through and into the wall of a city. A city symbolizes a government. The birth of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> nation has taken place, which is that government that shall rest upon the shoulder of the Prince of Peace. It is the kingdom for which the people have groaned and travailed for lo, these many centuries. Before it is fully made manifest, the Devil will make his last desperate fight to hold his power over the people and to turn their minds away from the true God and from his kingdom under the beloved Messiah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Of course it is the temple class, those who have entered into the joy of the Lord, who see the first evidence of the birth of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> nation of righteousness. By faith, and by the fulfilment of prophecy which we call the physical facts, they see it; and their hearts are thrilled with gladness. To such the Lord gives now the command: “Go through, go through the gates.” By this we understand him to mean: Take the lead, and as witnesses for the Lord by your actions show the people the way that leads into the kingdom of peace, life and happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> God has been developing his church for many years. Now this development work is about done. The time has come for God to make for himself a name; and to his saints he says: “Ye are my witnesses, . . . that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">am God.” It may seem strange to some that it should be necessary to give </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">witness to the fact that Jehovah </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font9">God; but when the facts as they exist are weighed, it is seen that during the many centuries past the name of J(diovali has been pushed into a corner even by those who claim to be his representatives. These false representatives of the Lord have united with other instruments of the enemy to dishonor the name of Jehovah and to drive back the true saints.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DISHONORING GOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> From Eden till now it has been the purpose of Satan to dishonor God's holy name and draw the people away from him. Divers and numerous instruments of his have been used for this purpose. For a long while the Catholic system has been dishonoring God's name by the false doctrines it has taught and still teaches. The enemy Satan, through this system, builded up a counterfeit of the church of God. That system heralds to the world that St. Peter is the foundation of the church; that the popes of Rome are his duly and divinely constituted successors; that these in turn are the vicegerents of Christ Jesus on earth, with supreme power and authority to act in the church and over the affairs of men. It has claimed for itself the power and authority which belong exclusively to God. It has taught the false doctrines of the mass, purgatory, eternal torment, the trinity and the divine right of earthly kings to rule. It has gladly taken into its system the unrighteous commercial giants and the political mountebanks, and has made them a part of the mystery of iniquity, which it denominates as the church of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> It has dishonored God by teaching that a woman is his mother, and has taught the people to pray to that woman, assuming that she can forgive sins. It teaches that many persons are consciously suffering in purgatory, and that money may be paid to priests to pray such out of purgatory and to relieve them from their sufferings. They have made the so-called Christianity a stench in tho nostrils of many honest men. This is not the only instrument, however, that the enemy has used and is using.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> The Protestants arose and with honest and fearless leaders, as instruments of the Lord, struck a terrific blow to the Catholic system. Soon, however, the Protestant system fell to the wiles and blandishments of Satan, the enemy. She has followed in the footsteps of her unclean and sullied mother. Now she is an ism without a protest against the unrighteous things of Catholicism. Mother and daughter parade hand in hand up and down the earth as the instruments of the enemy, seeking whom they may devour.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> Greedy for power and influence, with open arms Protestantism, the unfaithful daughter, has welcomed into her bosom the so-called scientists and philosophers. These evil seeds thus planted amongst her have grown into a mighty stalk and the whole system dishonors God. Today she is di\idcd into warring camps, and she resorts to the courts of the enemy’s organization upon the pretext of defending the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERNISTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> The Modernist’s camp is led by evolutionists, scientists, and philosophers so-called. They claim that their wisdom is far superior to that expressed by devout and holy men of old who wrote as they were moved upon by the invisible power of Jehovah God. With an expressed contempt for the Bible these self-constituted wise men arrogate to themselves knowledge and wisdom concerning the creation of man that sets at nought the authoritative words of the all-wise Creator of heaven and earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> Modernists dishonor God by denying his Word, denying the necessity for a Redeemer of man, and denying the blood of Jesus Christ; which is the purchase price of the world. This is the class of men leading in the organization which claims to be the Christian church. What inconsistency, what mockery! We will not dignify their God-dishonoring doctrines by entering into a discussion of them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FUNDAMENTALISTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> The Fundamentalists, another wing of the so-called Protestant church, dishonor God by teaching that there is no death, that those who seem to die are more alive after death than before, that all men arc inherently immortal, thus joining Satan the enemy in his first lie, by which he would make God a liar. They teach that Jehovah, instead of being a God of love, is a fiend who has provided a lake of fire and brimstone wherein with ghoulish glee he will torment unfortunate souls through all eternity with no hope of relief. And while posing before the people as believers in the kingdom of God, and with pious faces praying for its coming, they openly and presumptuously declare that by their own efforts they will establish the kingdom of God on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>17</sup> Fundamentalists willingly join hands with Modernists, Catholics, Christian Scientists, spiritists, profiteers and politicians in a presumptuous attempt to foist upon the people a world power under the title of the League of Nations, which they hail and proclaim as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. They further dishonor God by denying his plan for the restoration of the people under the reign of Messiah, and persecute the humble followers of Jesus who dare declare his message of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> When Satan the enemy has planted murder in the hearts of the leaders of the nations, and these nations moved by the evil influence of Satan have gone to war, the clergy of all the systems, contrary to the Word of him whom they claim to represent, urge the people into the battle of fire and blood, and pray God’s blessing upon each of the warring factions while they destroy one another. Thus again they dishonor God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>19</sup> Satan the enemy, in furtherance of his scheme to blind the people and turn them away from God, brings in the blighting heresies of spiritism, theosophy,. Christian Science, New Thought so-called, and other like fraudulent teachings. Many of the representatives of Satan, the enemy, teach that there is no Devil, others deceive themselves and the people by teaching that the Devil is bound, while still others are lulled to sleep both morally and spiritually and fail and refuse to lift their voices against his great onslaught of falsehoods.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>20</sup> In these closing years of the age, fraught with tremendous results, the enemy Satan comes like a flood into the earth to destroy all faith in God and to turn the people into darkness. Truly we are in a time when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people. At the same time the light of the Lord Jehovah shines into the faces of his saints with ever increasing brilliancy. The forces of evil and the forces of righteousness rapidly take their respective places in the great and final conflict. While the leaders of the various systems, as the representatives of the evil one, are crying aloud their false doctrines, the people are in confusion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>21</sup> Behold the people scattered like a flock of sheep upon the mountain tops with no shepherd in whom they can trust. (Zechariah 10:2,3) The self-constituted shepherds have been unfaithful to their charge. They have fed themselves and grown fat and let the flock of God starve. Millions of people of good-will now wander about in darkness, not knowing which way to turn. They are the victims of overtaxation for the support of a part of the Devil’s organization. They are smarting under the lash of the conscienceless politicians, while being robbed by the profiteers and blinded by the false and confusing teachings of the clergy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>22</sup> The politicians and the profiteers, the scientists and the philosophers, the Catholic and the Protestant clergy and their allies, all as instruments of Satan, wickedly combine and presumptuously claim to hold all the light there is for the human race. But with all they can offer nothing that brings rest and satisfaction to the people. They each hold up their standard and say to the people: “Flee unto us and stand by us. We make the world worth while.” And for answer the people say: “Why should we flee to you ? We have asked you for bread; and you gave us a stone. We have asked you for meat, and you gave us a serpent, and we are sick unto death.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH HEARS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>23</sup> In this hour of distress and perplexity, when the enemy comes in like a flood to sweep the people away from God and overwhelm them, there comes the clear command from the Word of God to those who have the spirit of the Lord, saying, “When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.” (Isaiah 59 :19) Again the command from the Lord: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people.” These commands clearly mean that those who have the spirit of the Lord must do something. Concerning the manner of doing this, as to how they shall enter the gates and what the gates are, Jehovah says: “And thou shalt call . . . thy gates Praise.” (Isaiah GO: 18) Clearly this means that the saints must jcyfully and with praise of Jehovah point the people to the way that leads to his kingdom and its attending blessings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE STANDARD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> The </span><span class="font9">command to “lift up the standard” of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font9">must be obeyed. Those who have the spirit of the Lord will with joyful heart respond to the command and move into action. It is a call for action. Let no one who has the spirit of the Lord now slack his hand. Let the standard be lifted up to the people. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">standard is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font9">ensign raised up for the people and to serve as a guide. World powers, commercial giants, scientists, philosophers, and ecclesiastics, all have put up their respective standards. By these the enemy Satan hopes to so confuse the people and confound them that they will all in disgust turn away from Jehovah God and deny his holy name. This has been the actual result of the systems that hold up their standards. The cries of the people have come up to God and he has commanded that another standard shall be raised.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>25</sup> The standard.that the spirit of the Lord now commands to be lifted up is the standard of truth. It is the truth that satisfies. It is the truth alone that will open the eyes of the people and the truth will make them free. The standard of the Lord serves as a twofold purpose;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> to </span><span class="font9">wit, to mark the rallying point for the people and to define the way of righteousness and holiness through which the people must pass in order to be the recipients of the ble sings which God has reserved for them that obey him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>G</sup> Some would now dishonor the Lord by saying that he committed every detail of his truth to man and that the. light of truth, instead of shining more and more according to promise, ceased to shine in 1916; and that since then there is nothing more to do. Let us remember that the truth is God’s and net man’s. Let us have in mind that Jehovah is the author and will be the finisher of the great plan of salvation. Let us remember that Christ Jesus is in command of the forces of Jehovah and that this commandment is committed to no man. Let us remember that the light is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof, and that he will let it shine upon his Word in his own due time and guide his people in the way that they should go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MUCH TO DO YET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>27</sup> For some time the church has been declaring “'the day of vengeance of our God”. For some time she has been proclaiming the message of comfort and glad tidings to the peoples and nations as a witness. But there is much more to do. The saints must prepare the way for the people, and must do this as instruments in the hands of the Lord. The people must know that the truth, like as Jerusalem was to the Jews, is a place of rest and hope. There are millions of people of good-will and good desire in the earth who should know the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> Those of the world who for years have been hearing error </span><span class="font9">must be advised of the presence of the King and of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">establishment of hi:* kingdom. These must be told </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font9">Jehovah is the only true God, that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and King, and that in and by his kingdom will come life and blessings. This the Lord would have done in order that the people may not be overwhelmed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font9">the flood of errors brought in by the enemy. The time has come for Jehovah to make for himself a name </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">the earth. The church has a part in this to the extent of being the witnesses for the Lord; and with joy, singing as they go through the gates that lead into </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">kingdom, they must point the people to the way and the only way that will bring their desire and their blessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE THE WAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>29</sup> The command of God to his saints now on earth </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is: </span><span class="font9">“Prepare ye the way of the people.” How can the saints prepare the way? The answer is: By boldly, fearlessly and joyfully making proclamation of the truth </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">God and his kingdom, and proving by their course of action that they believe that the way to eternal life in happiness is the gateway that leads into the kingdom </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">God. They must tell the people the truth about God and about his King and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>30</sup> Further the command is: “Cast up, cast up the highway.” How can this be done? By pointing the people to the course of righteousness and holiness which </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font9">will require of those who will inherit eternal, life. They must be told what the Lord’s law requires. They must be told what is good. This is summed up in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">few words by the prophet: “What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” (Micah 6:8) It is the saints of God, those who have his spirit, who are his faithful witnesses, that must point out to the people the way of the highway of holiness; and this they must do before the last saints leave the earth. Thus they are preparing a way for the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>31</sup> Again the command is: “Gather out the stones.” How can the stones be gathered out? The answer is: By showing the people that the false doctrines taught by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">various systems are great stumbling-stones; that the leaders have stumbled over these and have even fallen upon the Chief Corner-stone; that the leaders have filled the way with false doctrines, which are the stumbling-stones of the people; that the people must discard these false doctrines, forsake the false teachers and turn </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">the Lord and learn of him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>32</sup> The enemy knows that his time is short. He knows that the great battle of Armageddon is rapidly drawing </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">on, </span><span class="font9">when the conflict between the Lord of righteousness and the god of evil shall take place. It is an awful and terrible time. It is the time when God has com-man, led his people of Zion to sound the alarm. Judging- the future by the past we can see that Satan’s primary purpose is to confuse the people and turn them </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font9">from Jehovah completely; and to destroy the saints who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ, and who are the avowed enemies of the evil one. (Revelation 12:17) We see that the physical facts abundantly bear out this conclusion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>33</sup> Big business, big politicians, big preachers, Catholic and Protestant, scientists and philosophers, and various other instruments of the Devil lift up their respective ensigns, or standards, each calling to the people to rally unto them. The din of confusion rises higher and higher; and the Devil, with other instruments, exercising his evil and invisible power, injects into the minds of people the thought, ‘If all of these systems represent God, then we will have nothing to do with that God’; and thereby he hopes to turn the people’s mind away from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>34</sup> Jehovah says to his people, the saints: “Ye are my witnesses, . . . that I am God.” Then there comes to them the clear command, ringing out with no uncertain tones: “Lift up a standard for the people.” There is none other on earth to lift up a standard or ensign to the people except the saints, those who have the spirit of the Lord, and who are therefore his witnesses. Everyone who will be faithful to God and to his kingdom will joyfully seize hold upon the standard and lift it up high and cry unto the people: This is your rallying ground, flee unto this standard, flee unto the Lord; for his standard of truth opens wide the gates that lead unto his kingdom and to endless blessings and joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>35</sup> Lift up the Lord’s standard for the people by showing them the way to righteousness. They must be taught that “righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">reproach to any people”. (Proverbs 14:34) The standards lifted up by the agencies of the evil one are’ covered with sin. The standard of the Lord is a standard of righteousness. This standard of righteousness, those who have the spirit of the Lord will participate in lifting up now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>30</sup> Long ago St. Paul, under inspiration of the holy spirit, wrote: ‘The whole creation groans and travails in pain together till now, waiting for the manifestation of God’s kingdom.’ (Romans 8: 22) Behold the time of deliverance has come; and this is the hour in which the saints on earth, as the representatives of the King of Righteousness, shall lift high a standard, calling upon the people to rally to it and to learn the truth and, learning it, follow it and be made free.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>37</sup> The light of the new day is shining into the faces of the saints with increased brilliancy. Let us walk in the light that we may have fellowship with the Lord and our King. Those who have put on, and are keeping on, the wedding garments; who have been brought under the robe of the Lord’s righteousness; who have been found in the temple class; and who have entered- into the joy of the Lord, now have sweet fellowship with tho present King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>38</sup> The words of the prophet, written long ago, seem to aptly fit and apply to the saints at this time: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the. breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.”—Isaiah 30: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>39</sup> The moon is a symbol of God’s law, therefore symbolically representing the expressed will of God. Those fully devoted to the Lord now delight to do his will, and to such his will is so clear that it shines forth to them as the sun. These are they who have entered into the joy of the Lord and with praise lift up the gates and point to the way of holiness. God’s will expressed, symbolized by the moon, to the saints shines forth with a brilliancy likened unto the sun in times past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>40</sup> It will be noticed that “the light of the sun shall be sevenfold”. The sun symbolizes the light of the kingdom of the Lord. Indeed, is not this light now increased sevenfold to the saints? Do not the saints see and appreciate now as never before the fact of their privilege of being witnesses for the kingdom and marking its onward and victorious march to relieve the people and uplift them and bless them in due time ? The great truths concerning the kingdom warm and cheer the saints and illuminate them, because they are the children of light. It does not scorch. They delight in it. But to those who have fallen under the influence of Satan the enemy, and who would turn the minds of the people from God, who strive to hold the nations in darkness that the wicked one might continue to reign, the Lord, through his prophet, says: “Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: and his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity; and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.”—Isaiah 30: 27, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>41</sup> The light of the kingdom of Mbssiah shining through the message of truth is sevenfold hotter to the enemy and scorches those who are against the Lord. (Revelation 14: 10) The saints who have the spirit of the Lord will participate in lifting up the standard against the enemy. None other will and none other can. The standard is the message of the truth, the message of the kingdom. With greater joy to the saints the light increases'sevenfold; while their enemies shall be tormented with fire in the presence of those who love the Lord; and then their wicked works shall be destroyed with the brightness of the Lord and his truth.— 2 Thessalonians 2:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>42</sup> Already we have preached, by the grace of the Lord, rhe glad tidings of the end of the world and the presence of the King and his kingdom. Already we have told the people that millions now living will never die. and have brought to them a message of comfort. But there is more to be done. The standard of the Lord must be lifted up that the people may have an opportunity to know the truth of the kingdom and to know the way that leads to life, liberty, peace and endless happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>43</sup> Let every saint now on earth daily keep before his mind rhe words of Jehovah: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, . . . that I am God.” &quot;Lift up a standard for the ppople.” This now is the battle-cry. Let it be given with joy in the Lord, having always in mind that &quot;the joy of the Lord is your strength”. Let us be true and faithful to our Lord now ami obey his call to action, singimz the praises of our God and our Lord as we </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font9">through the gates.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PAUL’S METHOD OF PREACHING CHANGED—PAUL’S KNOWLEDGE OF SATANIC POWER—PAUL’S FAITHFUL WITNESS TO THE TRUTH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Being therefore justified hy faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Bomans 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font9">E HAVE concluded .our studies in the establishment and spread of the gospel. The lessons of the past quarter have taken us with the Apostle Paul from Athens to Rome, and to the end of the record </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">this ministry. The Scriptures do not tell us of Paul’s last services to the church; nor, with the exception of Luke’s record in Acts, do they relate the early history </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the church. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">true pioneer, Paul sought to establish </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">gospel in the great centers where men gathered; for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">these places there was better chance of its being spread.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> There is reason for thinking that Paul had looked forward to preaching the truth in Athens, then the center of the world’s learning. He was now to meet those who knew nothing of the Jews’ sacred writings, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">therefore nothing of the dealings of God with that people. How would he address himself to them? In the providence of God he reached there alone, his traveling companions Silas and Timothy having been left behind at Thessalonica and Berea. He gladly availed himself of an opportunity which came to address himself </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">some of the most notable of the Athenians. He advanced his argument to them on their own ground of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">theory and fact of worship, and showed them the falsity of what they had. He failed to move the people, though a few believed. The Athenians laughed at Paul’s doctrine and at his statement of the resurrection </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the dead, even as the wise men of the earth do now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Paul left Athens saddened in spirit. His experiences there were different from any he had had before. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font9">Galatia he had been made to suffer much in body, and wherever he had gone enemies had persecuted him; but </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">Athens they did not try to hurt him. They laughed, and such indifference to the honor of God pained him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PAUL’S METHOD OF PREACHING CHANGED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Paul went on to Corinth, the other large Grecian city, one which was more engrossed in commerce than was Athens. There he determined to follow a different course. He would net talk with them about their gods </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9">their theories of life, but would preach Christ crucified as that which would satisfy every need, whether of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jew </span><span class="font9">or Gentile. This relieved his mind, made his </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">course </span><span class="font9">easier for him, and proved to be fully effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> This does not mean that Paul made a mistake in Athens, or that some failed to get the truth because its messenger did net give a clear sound. It means that Athens had no ear for the truth, and that Paul learned how to give his message to the Grecians in the better way. No doubt Paul in Corinth was in some measure fearful; for he was assured by the Lord that he should </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">not be </span><span class="font9">hurt there. In his first ministry in Europe, at Philippi, he had- been allowed to suffer hurt. Now the Lord gave him assurance that he could follow his work in rest of mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Though the church gave him more concern that did any other, Paul learned to love the Corinthians. It was to them he wrote his hymn of love, than which no finer word concerning love has ever been spoken, no better analysis given. The Corinthians were taken with the glamour of “gifts” and cared but little for that which the gift meant. We do not know what was the subsequent history of the church in Corinth, nor indeed that of any of these churches; but we know that some were faithful to the Lord and to the Word of Truth, and that the apostle did not beat the air in his work. We shcul.l remember that the things which Paul did in establishing the churches and the things which ho showed to them were done and written for the sake of the church as a whole.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> After his comparatively long stay in Corinth, where he was at one and the same time a helper in righteousness to the many and a test to those who did not want the truth, Paul left for Jerusalem. He had taken a vow, as the Jews sometimes did; and he went to get clearance from it in the temple, as the Jews were accustomed to do. Also he had gifts for the poor saints in Jerusalem, which he desired to hand over to the brethren there. He waited in Jerusalem only a short time, and then went off again overland across Asia Minor.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PAUL'S KNOWLEDGE OF SATANIC POWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> After visiting the churches in Galatia, which he had established many years before, he went to Ephesus, where he would have gone much earlier only that the spirit had prevented him. He stayed in Ephesus three years, and it may be said that he set the truth in all that part of Asia. The riot which arose in Ephesus through the hatred and greedy fears of Demetrius has become a part of the world’s history. It hastened Paul’s intended departure, and no doubt did much to establish all the brethren in the faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Some years later Paul wrote the epistle known as the Ephesians, one of the greatest messages given to the church. Writing to them was a much pleasanter task than writing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9"> the Corinthians; for to the Ephesians he could speak freely of the highest and greatest things, because they lived such a life as made it as easy for them to take as for him to give. In this epistle he tells of the high calling of the church in sharing with Jesus the glory which God has given to him, and says that the power which God put forth to raise Christ from the dead and to his own divine glory was an exhibition of the almighty power of God. This power operates in the church by the holy spirit of Ged, by means -of the tests and providences which come upon the disciple. (See Ephoians 1:19,20; Colossians 1:11.) But besides that, God gives his holy spirit to enlighten the mind and fill the.heart,- so that the man of God may be perfected, “filled with all the fulness of God.”—Ephesians 3: 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> It seems fitting that it was to the Ephesians Paul wrote of the wicked spirits in high places, those powerful beings who cooperate with Satan and who are partly under his control; for if one is told of the great and high places of divine favor it is necessary he should also know of those evil spirits which seek to destroy him as well as to thwart the purposes of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> After Ephesus Paul went by Troas into Macedonia and Greece; and after visiting all the churches, he was about to set out for Jerusalem by ship when he learned of a conspiracy against his life. He traveled by the land route, and took a ship which called at various ports in Asia Minor. It was on this journey that he met the elders of Ephesus at Miletus, and in a valedictory address gave them and the church in general the best account of what an elder should be. He reminded them of his work amongst them, and asked them to copy him. For three years he had served them out of love for them and at his own expense and in faithfulness to the Lord and his own commission. Paul was the sample mini;ter; an example which the preachers of today will not copy. It was then he told of what the Lord Jesus had said— It is better to give than to receive—words which should form the motto of every elder.—Acts 20: 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> On this journey, in every place where Paul met the brethren, the holy spirit witnessed to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem. So pointed were these in Caesarea, his last place of call before arrival in Jerusalem, that the brethren urged him not to go on. But Paul read the spirit’s message differently; the fact of the witness was an indication to him that he should go. On arrival there the brethren greeted him, but immediately asked him to prove to the Jerusalem Jews that he was not that enemy of the Jews and of Moses he was commonly reported to be. They asked him to associate himself with some men who had a vow and wished for its clearance, and who to get this must live in the temple courts for some days and then get absolution frem the priest. Paul decided to agree, perhaps because he himself had done the same thing on the last occasion he visited Jerusalem. This proved to be the beginning of things which led to more than four years’ imprisonment. Paul was attacked by the Jews and was rescued from.them by the Roman power, which seized and held him for more than four years. It prevented any open service in Jerusalem; and in all probability it was the means, of breaking up the apostolic organization of the church in Jerusalem. Henceforth we read no more about the church having association with the temple, nor indeed does the Scripture again mention the temple in Jerusalem. Probably Paul made a mistake, but the Lord knows how to make the mistakes of his servant serve him, and he overruled this for the benefit of all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> It is almost certain that in the resultant two years in prison in Cmsarca Paul helped Luke to write his gospel; for during that time Luke would have opportunities of conferring with the brethren in Jerusalem and of gaining that knowledge of which he states he had exact information.—Luke 1:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> Paul made his defence before two Roman governors, and also before King Herod Agrippa; but when it seemed he was to be thrown to the ravenous wolves of the Jews he appealed to Caesar in Rome.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PAUL’S FAITHFUL WITNESS TO THE TRUTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> The incidents of the voyage to Rome, and the kindness he received from the centurion, and the dangers to which he and the 275 others who were with him in the ship were subjected, and how, though the ship was a total wreck, every life was saved because God had given them all into Paul’s hand, our recent studies have shown and left a clear memory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> In Rome Paul met the Jews, and spent a whole day telling them of the things which he preached; and as they believed only half-heartedly or not at all, he told them that the time had come when Isaiah’s words must be fulfilled, and the gospel go to the Gentiles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>17</sup> After that Paul spent two years in his own hired house, and at the end he witnessed to the powers that be. Perhaps even to Nero himself he witnessed; for he says the Lord delivered him out of the lion’s mouth, and it may well be that he thus refers to that abnormally depraved and cruel man, one of the most degraded human beings ever brought into prominence and power. Without boasting in himself he could say: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“I can</span><span class="font9"> do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13) This record of the most notable apostle is for our inspiration and encouragement.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR DECEMBER 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Ills holy arm hath gotten him the victory”— Psalm 98:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font9">EHOVAH is the Most High above all others, the Creator of heaven and earth, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty God. Melchizedek was priest of the Most High God. Melchizedek was a type of God’s executive officer, hence he typified the Logos, Jesus, Christ Jesus, and the great Deliverer. The Lord Jesus Christ is the great executive officer of Jehovah to carry into action the divine plan. Therefore he is the right hand and holy arm of Jehovah the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christ is the one whom God uses to get the victory for the church, the members of his body. (1 Corinthians 15: 57) In the great war in heaven against the dragon It is the Right Hand and Holy Arm of God that gains the victory. (Revelation 12: 7-9) In the fight on earth between the beast, the Devil’s organization and the Lamb, it is the mighty Executive Officer of God that is victorious. (Revelation 17:14) The victory over the Devil and his organization will be complete; and when that victory is won there will stand with the great Executor of Jehovah the 144,000 called, chosen and faithful ones. The victory is God’s, which he gets in his own due time through his “holy arm”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Having this full assurance now both by the sure word of prophecy and by the facts in fulfilment of prophecy, the saints have every reason to be comforted in their own hearts. This is the time referred to by Jesus when he said: “And when these things begin to come to pasthen look up, lift up your heads, for your deliverance-draweth nigh.”—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord is permitting the church to receive great comfort and consolation now for a purpose, and we are told that the purpose is that these in turn might carry the message of consolation to others that mourn, that they too might receive a measure of comfort. As the truly consecrated carry out this provision they grow more in the likeness of the Lord and more fully appreciate the fact that it is more blessed to give than to receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR DECEMBER 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Rejoice in the Lord alway.”—Philippians</span><span class="font9"> J.’4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font9">HEN the Lord Jesus was about to take his departure from earth his disciples were sad. He told them that he would come again and receive them to himself and for them to await his coming. All through the age the saints have waited for the coming of the Lord. Now the Lord has come. The sleeping saints have been awakened and are for ever with the Lord. Those this side the vail in the temple condition rejoice because of the presence of the Lord and have </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sweet </span><span class="font9">fellowship with him. Almost all the scriptures that speak of rejoicing refer to the time of the Lord’s return. We should expect it so because he is the Bridegroom and has returned for his bride; he is the Savior of mankind, the Ruler and Blesser of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To rejoice means to express gladness in a high degree ; to have pleasurable satisfaction. The anointed have every reason to rejoice. Having the witness of the holy spirit that the Lord has called them according to his purpose, and knowing that they love the Lord, they know that all things shall work together for their good because God has promised thus. They know that their deliverance is at hand and soon they shall be ushered into the glorious presence of the Prince of Peace. They know that at his right hand shall be fulness of joy and they shall have pleasures for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would be, in a measure, selfish to anticipate these blessings alone if there was no hope of relief for the groaning creation. All the saints feel some special interest in some particular person on earth. Now they know that these will have an opportunity to receive the blessings of the Lord, which he has provided for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Truly the saints now should rejoice alway. They should take more joy in telling the people the glad tidings of the blessings that shall be brought to them through the kingdom of God and thereby comfort the hearts of others that they may rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR DECEMBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The tree of life is for the healing of the nations.” —Revelation 22: 2.</span></p>
<div><img src="w_E_19251101_files/w_E_19251101-3.png" alt="" style="width:24pt;height:26pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">HROUGHOUT the year our weekly texts have had to do with the commission God gave to Christ and the anointed members of his body to comfort one another and all that mourn and seek comfort. The church yet on earth has had much to do in the performance of this divinely-given commission. While they have brought comfort to others they in turn have received much consolation. Why is our God so loving and good to give his children these privileges ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After stating through his prophet the commission or authority of the church to thus act as his witnesses the Lord adds that he does so: “That they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that his name might be glorified.” Throughout the age God has been planting these trees, watering, nourishing and developing them. Now the age has ended. Truly most of these trees are matured and have entered into the fulness of joy. The remaining ones soon shall follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The loving kindness of our God and our Lord and Savior still continues toward the anointed and overcoming saints and will continue. In the Millennial Age these shall have the blessed privilege of aiding and comforting others. God has appointed a way to lead the people into endless life and happiness. His precious message of truth, as a healing stream, shall proceed from</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">his throne to enlighten, comfort and nourish the people. These trees of righteousness, which are the planting of God, are to be his instruments to administer this healing and comforting balm. By this means the Lord will revive, strengthen and heal the people of the sin-sick world, lift them up, dry their tears, take away their sickness and sorrow and give them peace and joy for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Truly the goodness of our God appears to us more wonderful each day. Let everyone now, who has received the commission to comfort others, see to it that he performs that commission faithfully, looking forward to his happy reward when he, as a tree of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, may be used of the Lord to heal the nations, and that he may reflect the eternal glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR DECEMBER 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die.” —John 11: 26.</span></p>
<div><img src="w_E_19251101_files/w_E_19251101-4.png" alt="" style="width:25pt;height:27pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">HE relentless enemy that has pursued mankind for more than six thousand years is death. The enemy Satan induced the first sin resulting in death. He is therefore a murderer. Not content with that great wrong he has maligned Jehovah for ages, and has used every means at his command to keep the people in ignorance of God’s gracious plan for their relief. The Logos, the Beloved of God, watched the course </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the evil one for centuries ; and then Jehovah sent him to earth to destroy death and him that hath the power of death the great enemy; that is, the Devil. The Scriptures show that the Logos undertook this task with much joy. In addition to having the joy of doing Jehovah’s will it was a real joy to him to be entrusted with the commission of removing the enemy and bring</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font9">man back into harmony with God. When on earth, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">while teaching the people concerning God’s kingdom, he delighted to comfort the hearts that had been made sad by the enemy, death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus was a special friend of Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha. He was often entertained in their home at Bethany. He manifested great love for this family. Without doubt they loved Jesus very much. Lazarus became sick. Immediately the two sisters thought of their dear friend Jesus, and sent him a message informing him of the sickness of Lazarus. Jesus knew this sickness was for a particular purpose and said: “This sickness is . . . for the glory of God, and that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.”— John 11:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus, accompanied by his disciples, proceeded to Bethany. There he was met by Martha and Mary. He found them in great sorrow and distress. They wept bitterly for their beloved brother, who was then dead and buried. Moved by their intense sorrow Jesus wept with them. He must have called to mind then the tremendous sorrow that the peoples of earth had suffered because of the evil one and death caused by him. Then Jesus proceeded to call Lazarus from the tomb. There must have been great joy in that home resulting from this gracious act of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus was here teaching his disciples and the two sisters, and from the record of the facts many others, the great truth that God in due time will bring the dead out of the tomb. The doctrine of the resurrection was here most beautifully taught by the Master. In this gracious act the Lord was a great comfort to those who loved Lazarus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The members of the body of Christ are commissioned to comfort those that mourn. This miracle of Jesus, in awakening Lazarus from death, was shortly before the end of his earthly course. Th,e Scriptures show that he knew that his earthly race was nearly run. He was not thinking about himself, but anxious to use the opportunity to tell of the glory of his Father, and to comfort those that mourned, and to leave behind him proof by which his followers could comfort others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now the church is near the end of its earthly career. Its journey here is almost done. The members this side should not be thinking too much about self and how soon they might get away from the earth and enter the gates of endless bliss there to reign with the Lord. They should have in mind always the faithful performance of their commission while this side the vail. They should be anxious here to be the faithful witnesses of God, and to glorify his name by declaring his kingdom and by teaching the many sorrowing ones of the earth his gracious plan to open the graves and to bring back to the people their beloved dead. They should point them to the proper time when they will be united with their loved ones; and those who are obedient will be granted life and endless happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us hasten to tell those who are here that millions now living shall see the manifested glory and goodness of our Lord; and that if obedient to the laws of his kingdom, they shall never die; also that the dead shall be brought forth to live, and that then ‘he that liveth and believeth on the Lord shall never die’. What a happy and blessed privilege is that of the church now to bring to the people this message of consolation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR DECEMBER 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thine, 0 Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">■—1 Chronicles 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font9">AVID, whose name means beloved, is a type of the Beloved One of God; namely, the faithful members of the church this side the vail. Solomon, a man of peace and rest, pictured the church in glory, both Head and body. David put forth all of his efforts to prepare the material for the temple of the Lord. His antitype are those who are faithful and who are putting forth their best endeavors to prepare the material for the great antitypical temple of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past year it has been the privilege of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">church </span><span class="font9">to consider texts concerning the comfort of those in Zion who mourn and also of others who are in distress. With almost every text attention has been directed to the fact that service is essential to the performance of the church’s divinely-given commission. Some of the Lord's children have not appreciated very much what has been said about service. Others not only have greatly appreciated what has been said, but ha\e appreciated much more what they have been able to do in the service. Ged has so arranged that the one who is the most active brings the greatest amount of comfort to others. At the same time these are testifying that Jehovah is the great God and that his kingdom is the consolation for human ills. Those who have failed or neglected to participate in the service, as opportunity has offered, have missed many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Service is beautifully and forcefully foreshadowed by what David did. With all that he did his devotion to the Lord increased. It is often so with the church now. After David had spent his force in making ready the material for the temple he called the people together and told them that the house was not for man but was for the Lord God; and that Solomon would rule over it. Now we have reached the time when the antitypical Davidic class has put forth its beast endeavors to prepare the material for the antitypical temple of God. Of course God has done the work, but he has permitted </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font9">member to do what was within his power. It is the privilege of these to announce to the people on earth that the temple is the Lord God’s and shall be to his glory; and that the glorified antitypical Solomon, Christ Jesus the Head, will rule over the people; and that through his ministrations the people will be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Da\id rejoiced in what God had permitted him to do. Now the church can greatly rejoice that she has had a part in the Lord's work. David blessed the Lord before all the congregation. It is the privilege of the church now to sing the praises of the great Jehovah God before the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">David rejoiced that all his blessings had come from Jehovah, and to him he would give all the praise and glory. Iks words then spoken announced the real heart sentiment of those now on the earth who keep) the commandments of God, and who rejoice in the service of the Lord, and who have the testimony of Jesus Ckrist that they are of the temple class. Together these now joyfully say: “Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, 0 Lord, and thou are exalted as <sup>1</sup> ead above all.”—1 Chronicles 29 : 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been our blessed privilege to glorify the Lord during the year and to bring comfort to those who mourn. Let us continue to glorify him, and to rejoice, in whatsoever he has for us to do in the year that is opening.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUTH SPREADING IN AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I would like to relate to you a little of my experiences on the Gold Coast. When I arrived in Seceondee, I found out there that there was no other place suitable to give a lecture but the Wesleyan school. I approached the preacher in charge, introducing myself to him as a missionary. He asked me what body I was connected with. I told him: The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. lie replied, “I never heard of that society, but as a missionary you can have either the church or the school room, whichever suits you best.” I decided right away to take the school, thinking that some of ihe people of other denominations might have a little prejudice about coming to the church. The preacher did not attend the lectures, having to be away, for which I was not sorry. But he tried </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> undo what I had done when </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font8">returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the first three lectures, I sold thirty-five full sets, fifty Harps and many other books. I had to cable to Freetown for fifty additional sets, and two weeks after the fifty arrived I hadn’t a set left, so I had to cable again for ninety sets, and ninety Harps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fourth lecture, “To Hell and Back,” had the Wesley-ans and others stirred up. Learning from a reliable source that the only available places for giving lectures along the Gold Coast were the Wesleyan schools, I realized that in order to give the witness in the other places I would have to move fast, before the preachers awoke to the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a week in Seceondee my next stop was Elmena, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixty </span><span class="font8">miles away. I got the Wusleyan school there, delivered two lectures; thence to Cape Coast, delivered three lectures there in the Wesleyan school; and from there I went to Salt Pond, where I gave four lectures. There the preacher actually took the hand-bills from me and went into every shop, store and office of the little place and urged the people to come out and hear my lecture. From there I proceeded to Accra, where 1 met Brother C. Brown. I delivered three lectures there. In all the places the halls were packed to their utmost capacity, and the books were purchased freely at each place. At each of the places mentioned the people applauded time and again when they heard of the good news of the kingdom. Some wept for joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brother C. Brown has lectured and canvassed the other places where I haven’t touched. Brother Brown will be in this week from the Gold Coast, to go on to Bathurst, Gambia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother and servant by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">W. R. Brown.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BRING KINGDOM CHEER TO PRISONERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I just want to tell you how much I appreciate The Watch Tower, especially the account of your trip </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font8">Hurope. We are so thankful to our heavenly Father. I suppose it was just the time for the Spanish people to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About two years ago I received the “Talking with th.-» Dead” and the “Millions” books. Then I felt so downhearted when I found that the Italian people here did not want them. One day I was called to the county jail to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">see</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">if I would stand bond to take an Italian prisoner out. While I was there I found out that there were about forty prisoners in a little room, and among them was a Catholic priest from Spain. He had been there for four years. These unfortunate men were anxious to get something to read, so I begged the jailer to let me put two of the books in, and he consented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T -was successful in getting the one prisoner bailed out. and he came to the house and worked for us. He accepted the truth and symbolized his consecration. He told me to try to get more books into the jail. He had learned that every time a prisoner was freed he wanted to take the book with him. So I went back to see the jailer, but he said, ‘'Those books cause too much trouble; every one wants them.” I told him why, and finally he consented to let me leave some more copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I left word for those who did not get the liooks that when they got out to come to my house and I would get them the books. Many came and went away rejoicing. The priest could speak several languages, and he would translate the books to the various foreign-speaking prisoners-I heard later that he was deported to Spain. Now we can see our heavenly Father's hand in this. If the Italian and Spanish want the truth he will send some among them to teach them, even if he has to permit them to come to this country and be put into jail, in order to learn about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So. dear Brother, with all of my trials, which have been many since 1918, I have had many blessings. The Lord has been so wonderfully good to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We want to assure you of our love and prayers. I know your time is very valuable, but I have been wanting to tell you about this ever since it happened. Fully 200 prisoners have read the kingdom message while in jail in Tampa. Enclosed you will find a check to help in the Lord's work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">lour sister in the one hope,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONFIDENCE AND LOYALTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Greetings in the name of our King I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We desire to express our love and absolute confidence in your efforts to glorify our heavenly Father’s name by your constant labors of love for his dear flock this side of the vail, and in the proclamation of the kingdom message to the world at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We realize, dear Brother, that wo are living in trying times; and what a test it is to our faith as we see some who walked with us for some time, and whom we love very dearly, are now saying all manner of evil against us falsely for Christ’s sake. But this will not deter us, by the Lord’s grace, from fighting the good fight of faith ; for we know the trying of our faith worketh patience, and patience engen-dereth hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, for the love of God is thus shed abroad in our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our prayers go up daily in your behalf that the Lord may give you the needed strength to go on; and we wish to assure you, dear Brother, that in a class as a whole, and as individuals, you have our whole-hearted cooperation and unqualified support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours for the kingdom,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO EVERY NATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to the wonderful report of our Society’s activities abroad as set forth in the recent Watch Tower :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Anyone reading that report should see and realize that the Watch Tower Bibee &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is fulfilling the prophetic statement of our Lord concerning the preaching of this message to every nation, after which must come the end. And it is noteworthy that the Society alone is doing this. No other cult or people upon earth is doing this preaching to every nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Either the Society is fulfilling this prophecy or it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is not </span><span class="font8">being fulfilled. Either God is doing nothing whatever </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">here </span><span class="font8">on earth at the present time, and Jesus is doing nothing worthy of mention, or else the Society is doing that work. If the Society is not the Lord’s channel for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font8">claiming of this last gospel message, then the Lord lias </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font8">channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">None of the split-off ones is fulfilling the emphatic statement of Christ: ‘This gospel </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font8"> be preached to all nations.’ No gospel is being now preached and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">no kingdom </span><span class="font8">message is now being proclaimed if the Bible Students under direction of the Brooklyn office are not doing it. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font8">is not reasonable to suppose that no remarkable religious work is now being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Never in the history of the church was so much done </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as is </span><span class="font8">now being done. Even the blinded ones should see that and fall in line for service. This one fact sei ties the matter of what is the channel of the Lord in these closing days of the Gospel Age and the opening up of the new regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Faithfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. A. Bohnet.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EXCELLENT SUGGESTIONS FOR BEREAN STUDY </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Di:\r. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Phoenix, Arizona, elders have adopted a plan which I believe would be helpful in all classes served by more than one elder; viz., that before the principal article in the Watch Tower is taken up for study by the class, the elders meet and discuss the major points in the article, to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">end </span><span class="font8">that all may be in agreement. The elders are instructed to “feed the flock”. Obviously, if they are not in agreement concerning the message of the Tower, they cannot help the friends to get the greatest good from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a large class, not far from here, the elders were </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">hav</span><span class="font8">ing quite </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a little</span><span class="font8"> trouble in connection with the study of a Watch Tower article. They all seemed to agree that the M writ Tower was right, but they did not altogether agree as to what it was that the Watch Tower said. Finally they got together, thrashed out their differences, and came to an agreement. Our plan is to make such discussions a regular matter of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, to make such a plan worth while, it will be necessary for each elder to make a thorough study of the article before coming to the meeting. Then the discussion can very well be confined to the “high lights” in the article, and one meeting will suffice. The elders must, of course, understand that no one comes to the meeting for the purpose of convincing the others that he is right and they are wrong. To serve its purpose, the meeting must be for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">exchange of opinion, and mutual helpfulness. In reading </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font8">article, it may be that a certain thought will stand out conspicuously to one and another thought to another. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font8">two thoughts may, at first hearing, be divergent, but when properly “dressed down” in discussion will really prove to be in accord, and may possibly be fused into a larger view of the entire subject. In other words, the purpose of the meeting is helpfulness, and not dominance of the thought of one or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font8">foregoing suggestion </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">made in the belief that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font8">forestalling divisions among the elders, much will be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">done </span><span class="font8">to forestall divisions in the classes. It is quite clear, from recent Watch Tower messages, that Satan is very anxious to cause divisions among the Lord’s people; and every possible safeguard should be erected against his attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sister Peterson joins with me in assuring you of our deep Christian love, and appreciation of the rich blessings the Lord is sending us through your faithful ministrations. Our daily prayer is that he may continue to strengthen </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">sustain you.</span></p>

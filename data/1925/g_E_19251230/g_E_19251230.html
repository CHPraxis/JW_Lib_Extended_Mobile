<p><span class="font6">TyETEOROIUGY is the science of the phe-1VX nomena of the atmosphere, especially those that relate to weather and climate; it has to do with the character of the weather and of atmospheric changes everywhere. It is an international science, as weather conditions of phenomenal character may start almost anywhere and go in any direction, though there are localities where they are more common, the more common being near the Himalaya mountains; and the usual direction of storms is from west to east, though hurricanes out of th® West Indies often travel northward. Meteorology may also be said to be the science of observing, registering and classifying' various and varying climatic and atmospheric phenomena in connection with the planets of our solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are three methods of studying the phenomena of weather: (1) The short-range forecasting as done by the Weather Bureau; (2) the local readings of thermometer, hygrometer and barometer for immediate and close-range forecasting; and (3) the long-range, which takes into consideration the positions, conjunctions and oppositions of practically every member of our solar system. The last of these is the one which shall have our special attention in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In sending out the generalities of weather conditions each day, the United States Weather Bureau bases its conclusions on reports from 240 stations in the United States and Canada, 22 in Europe, 36 in the West Indies and Central America, 17 in Mexico, 12 in the Pacific and Far East countries, and 9 in Alaska. Many of these reports come by radio and cable. The heralding of weather conditions has been and is a very important business of the government, especially for the farmer and stock raiser and shippers by land and sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the advent of the radio the reports are more accurate, in that sudden storm conditions are immediately dispatched. Radios on ships</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">arc often utilized to inform other ships and the Weather Bureau of raging cyclones and hurricanes, giving direction of the movement, the velocity and intensity, thus saving the lives of many people and minimizing the property loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is difficult for the Weather Bureau, or for anybody, to make forecasts for a particular locality, for storm conditions and air pressures prevail in more or less extended areas. But ©ver and anon the Weather Bureau finds that their calculations have gone amiss, that the elements are behaving after a fashion unprecedented, and the cause is not apparent. A surface condition is not always an indication of what prevails in the upper strata of atmosphere. That there are capers cut by the climate conditions, one of the directors of Meteorological service showed when he summed up the weather and earthquake conditions for the years 19221924. This report reads about as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year 1923 was abnormal for quakes, several sever* ones occurring in Japan and under the Pacific ocean. The number of quakes recorded here in 1923 was 233, the maximum being reached in February and July with 28, followed by 36 in September, and 22 in August. In 1924 the number recorded here was 217, the severity being less than in 1923. The abnormal meteorological conditions for these three years were: In 1922 th® Arctic ocean was freed of ica to a record extent. Prolonged severe storms on the Atlantic during the winter of 1923-23. During 1923-24 there were severe floods in Europe, record snowfalls in Argentine and New Zealand, severe drouths in California; and beginning in December 1924 record cold waves crossed Siberia, extending to Alaska and reaching southward to the southern states and to the Atlantic seaboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Based upon the abnormal atmospheric pressure in January, 1925, one of the coldest years on record was predicted; and we did have a cold, late spring with frosts which necessitated the replanting of gardens and fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The system which we are about to examine 135</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">shows Wat these are not wholly abnormal conditions but the things to be expected, because </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the peculiar planetary positions in the whirling, shifting combinations of conjunctions and oppositions of the various planets. When over 90% of the earthquakes predicted actually take place within the quake periods specified, there is something in evidence besides guessing. This system is what we might call the Hicks System, which was brought to a high plane of accuracy by the late Rev. Irl R. Hicks, having its beginning over forty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If our solar system were composed of but two bodies, the sun and the earth, there would be nothing to disturb the peaceful climatic conditions prevaiMag over the whole planet, except that our atmosphere would be disturbed during sunspot periods. The seasons would come and go, blending quietly into each other at the equinoxes and solstices. But there are seven ether planetary bodies in our solar system besides our own hmar satellite which, with their eVerehanging movements, make up hundreds of combinations which must be reckoned -with, the greatest of which is our relatively near neighbor the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There seem to be sun-spot cycles of inferior and superior influence, the former coming in 11.11 year cycles, and the latter in 55.6 year cycles. Tile next major sun-spot period is due in the winter of 1926-27. The power of the sun is incredible; it cannot be measured. Besides the light, heat and power which it gives off, harnessed and unharnessed, it has an estimated drawing power of sea water said to be at least one hundred and thirty quadrillion (130,000,000,000,900,000) tens each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gulf Stream is a miracle. It has been called an ocean river. It has more power than all other of the physical forces of the earth combined. It rises in the tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico, flows into the Atlantic ocean, thence northward and loses itself in the Arctic ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is estimated that in one hour’s time the enormous sum of 90,000,090,000 tons of water pass a given point. If this single hour’s flow of water were evaporated the remaining salts would require many times more than all the ships in the world to carry them. As far north as 81 degrees, 29 minutes, soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters (nearly two miles) has shown the Gulf Stream still to be very warm. It is a great factor in the general warming up ©f the climatic conditions of earth. It and the Japan Stream play their parts in the amelioration of earth’s atmosphere. Both of these have been shifted by recent earthquakes, and no one knows the course each will take when affected by the next earthquake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">General Characteristics af Weather</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fpXACTNESS in weather forecasting is an.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">impossibility; but the forecasts of the Hicks System may be used, intensified or modified by local conditions, such as geographical position, proximity to lakes, rivers, mountain ranges, etc.; for all ef these enter into the proposition, and with familiarity with these, associated things one need not be far wrong in weather anticipations, especially if consideration is given to thermometer, hygrometer and barometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The storm periods of the Hicks System are coincident with the Vulcan periods, called regular and reactionary, modified or intensified by the position and relation which the other members of the solar system bear to it. The time when the storms of a period will strike any given locality depends upon where one is, as to east, west, or central parts of the country. Storms have a tendency to move across the- United States from west to east. When the moon is in north declination, i. e., north of the equator, the storms normally travel from southwest to northeast; and when the moon is south of the equator the storms will usually come out of the northwest and travel southeast. When the storm is cyclonic the wind direction will depend on the position of the cyclone. Cyclones cover large areas, move from west to east, the wind traveling east on the south rim, north on the east rim, west on the north rim, and south on the west rim, with, possibly a large eddy in the center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All general storm areas in the United States form somewhere in the extreme west, southwest or northwest. At the approach of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">storm period, Vulcan period, while high barometer and general anti-storm conditions may still exist over much of the country eastward, somewhere in the west the temperature will rise, the barometer will begin to fall, the wind currents -will shift </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">points that presage change and storm, cloudiness ensues and storm areas of rain or snow take up their march across the country eastward. As these storm conditions advance, anti-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dbcbmbsb</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> SO, 1925 </span><span class="font6">storm conditions break down in front of them, and rise up behind them, giving us storms at the center of from two to five days’ duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of us have noticed that we may have a severe rain, say for instance at 3 o’clock on a certain day, and that then for three or four days the rain will recur a little milder and a little later each day until clear weather returns. This is caused by a perfectly plain planetary condition, the position that the earth bears to the inferior planets, Venus and Mercury. Not always when a storm area passes a given point will rain or snow fall to earth, but the storm will be indicated as passing overhead by the wind, temperature and barometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before a storm period the normal condition is fair and warmer; the storm will pass, then comes clear and cooler weather. All these phases are realized in the west, early in the storm periods; a day or so later in central; and later still in eastern sections. This accounts for the different kinds of weather which will prevail over the country during a storm period. The average rate of speed of storm areas is about 600 miles a day, being of greater velocity in the colder months. The periodic swing of storm periods shows us when to look for fair days, which of necessity must predominate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tropics act as earth’s great ventilator which keeps the cool air rushing in from the poles, and the ozone-laden air from the continual electrical discharges is carried high up; as it cools it gradually spreads towards the poles and slowly descends and begins to travel back equatorward, being drawn by the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation. Thus the process known as trade-winds goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the oceans there should be but few cold surface currents, and these only in shallow or partially land-locked places. Cold water is heavier than warm; and under normal conditions a cold stream of water flowing into a warmer one will go to the bottom and flow underneath, while a warm stream flowing into a colder body will keep to the surface. A normal circulation would evidently be one in which there is a steady flowing of the waters of the equatorial zones towards the poles, with a corresponding underneath flow of the cold waters of the polar regions towards the equator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The movements of air and water currents help us to appreciate the glory and power and wisdom of God in His kindness thus manifested</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">towards the children of men. God made the earth to be inhabited; the physical facts show this besides the revelation of His plan as recorded in the Bible,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The National Weather Book, in its chapter on <sup>ff</sup>The Solar System”, after showing that at times the solar system is pulled as much as 3,000,000 miles from its normal path by the planets grouping on one side of the sun, says in the closing paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That any properly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">informed,</span><span class="font5"> unbiased persons should doubt or deny that all meteorological phenomena are the direct products of astronomical conditions and changes, is a position that would be hard to explain or defend. Even those who make no claim to an astronomical education understand that all the changing seasons—■ summer, winter, spring and fall—with all the storms and weather peculiar to each season, grow out of the movements of the earth around the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The causes for the varied movements of the planets are perpetual and according to fixed laws, shifting backward and forward from one part of the year to another, carrying their perturbing influence with them. Hence the same season does not bring the same storms and weather every year. Neither does any given cause carry with it summer weather into winter, nor winter weather into summer; but each in its own way intensifies seasonable weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ecliptic is the apparent yearly path of the sun around the heavens, as it looks to us; but the ecliptic is in reality the path of the earth around the sun. The moon, by reason of its rotation around the earth, oscillates first inside and then outside of the earth’s direct path, which brings her between the earth and the sun at one time, and causes the earth to be between her and the sun at another. She also oscillates up and down, above and below the plane of the ecliptic, thus giving her path a corkscrew shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The moon’s path is never very far from the ecliptic; the swing from the ecliptic is never so far as the swing from the equator. If the moon’s new or full falls on the same day as her crossing the ecliptic there will be an eclipse. If new moon happens when the moon is on the ecliptic, the moon is between the earth and the sun, and the sun is eclipsed. When full moon happens on the ecliptic, the earth is between moon and sun, and the moon is eclipsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These eclipses are primary causes for earthquakes, violent storms, hurricanes or seismic disturbances, intensified ifthe electrical puU ia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">concentrated in one locality, or modified if the electrical energy is spread ©ver large areas. Earthquakes sometimes follow even the shadow </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">an eclipse, as in the northeast part of the United States last February 28 th. i Earthquakes are more common, too, where there are oil wells in operation. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclones and Tornadoes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">CYCLONE is a vast area of low atmes-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">pheric</span><span class="font6"> pressure, with currents of air eir-cling aroundit and flowing into it with an upward tendency. All general storm disturbances are more or less cyclonic in their character. A large 'cyclone will sometimes cover as much as the entire United States, but at it travels east it will sometimes be central on land and sometimes out at sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the northern hemisphere the general direction of the cyclone is from southwest to northeast. While the cyclonic disturbance is moving eastward the storms are raging at the outer edges in different extremes, whirling like a huge buzz saw, turning to the left as we in our minds face the north from a southern position. In the center of this mass there will be a calm; and these centers are not disturbed except, as the storm rims pass over them, the south winds on the front will carry warmth and the north winds on the rear will carry cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the lew pressure will come the high pressure, anti-cyclonic conditions, with cooler breezes from the northwest. Then comes the reactionary storm conditions, sometimes with renewed vigor, from the west, shifting to northwest. After the paroxysm, of a storm has subsided, if a dead calm sets in and the barometer shows no signs of rising, no matter if the sky is clear and the air is calm and balmy, those who understand those things will watch for the we,stern or rear -side of the cyclone to strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A tornado differs from a cyclone in that it is a small but exceedingly violent whirling point, comparatively local. When a tornado develops out of cyclonic conditions, it usually occurs on the south side and a little to the east of the center of down pr essure. ■ The violence .of a tornado is not. so much in the speed of the forward motion as. in<sub>;</sub> the. whirling speed. A tornado has , been defined as being &quot;The impingement of ether, Jutting down from space, cold and intensely charged with positive electricity, which is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">cause of low barometer, around which the warm air, negatively charged, circulates ascendingly from right to left”. . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are not to expect tornadoes all over the continent when they are predicted : they are of a very local nature and should be expected locally. Cyclones are larger, bat not damaging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T5te </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Language of the Barometer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpiIOSE who understand know that a rising barometer, west to north wind and cold, will bring clearing weather immediately behind the ■areas of low barometer and rain and snow. Eves before the actual storms, er areas ef cloudiness and precipitation, have passed east of the Mississippi river, and before the storm conditions have produced marked changes in the extreme east of the country, high barometer, northerly gales and cold, clearing weather, as a rule are found following on the heels of all marked winter storms from western and northwestern extremes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A rising thermometer, with falling barometer, at or near full moon, will bring cloudiness with winds and ruin, especially in March. If the full moon is ©n the equator, there will be abnormal earth currents, variations of magnetic needles, static in radios and telegraphic disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a very lew barometer lies along the southern border in the winter, with a bligaard and high barometer rashing out of the northwest, the cold and frost will reach far into the south. The lower the barometer and the warmer and brighter the weather as the storm conditions come on, the greater the danger of severe changes to storms and wintry weather. If the barometer is much below normal all over the country, the weather comparatively warm and rainy, the change to .rising barometer is almost certain to precipitate a rushing and dangerous cold wave, which will likely extend to the southern limits of the preceding. low barometer, even to the south coasts. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Equinoxes and Solstices</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE vernal equinox is when the days and nights are of equal length in March; the autumnal equinox is when the days and nights-are of equal length in September; the winter solstice is when the days are shortest in December; th© summer solstice is when the days are longest .in June.- In March the earth’s .equator is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">over</span><span class="font6"> the sun; in September the earth’s equator</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wider</span><span class="font6"> the sun. At these four-quarter marks of the earth’s passage around the sun there are more or less electrical disturbances and aggravation for the storm periods, March being the most severe and possibly December the least severe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The crisis of the electricar and magnetic excitement in March comes usually between the 10th and 15th. If the moon is at perigee and at one of her quarter-posts at this season, then the disturbances are greatly increased. These earth periods extend over about six weeks; and the disturbances are more or less intense, according to the pull of other planetary influences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The autumnal equinox is milder than the vernal; but should a Venus disturbance be combined with it, there will be a series of storm and weather perturbations out of the average. There may be sudden changes with phenomenal fluctuate ons of the barometer, and at such times shipping on the lakes and rivers is endangered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The earth is 3,000,000 miles nearer the sun in December than in June; and the reason for the colder weather is that th® sunshine comes to us on a slant from low in the south, with nights neatly twice as long as the days. The colder weather of January and February is caused by the accumulated cold which the sun has not yet been able to overcome. Likewise the heat of July and August is accumulated heat as the sun apparently passes back over his own track, which he made in reaching his summer solstice. Furthermore, the rays of the sun at that season are more direct upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eclipses and Oppositions</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS a fact that meteorological perturbations are increased at the eclipses of the sun and moon. These occur when earth, sun and moon are in a line;' for there is a direct intercepting and breaking of the electro-magnetic force or solar energy that forms a bond between the sun and every other body of our solar system. When planets are in conjunction or opposition, or both, the same thing results, but in a lesser degree. Even when the earth passes between the sun and so great a distant planet as Saturn there is a perturbation of our atmosphere caused by the earth swinging into the solar energy which plies between the sun and Saturn. If it is warm at such a time, the warmth will be prolonged, with dryness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes planets will gather on one side of our earth and exert such a pull on the electromagnetic ether that plays between the sun and the earth that cold will result, which is quite unseasonable and which is otherwise unaccounted for. The oppositions, conjunctions/ equinoxes, and quadratures of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have a distinct effect upon the earth, and the movements of Vulcan and the moon are the great factors in causing variety. The oppositions of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn bring dryness; and when Mercury and Venus are at inferior conjunction we have wetness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The direct cause of storms and weather phenomena on our globe lies in the sun. If its great energy were not sometimes excited to a maximum, and at other times modified to a minimum, we could reasonably count on the same kinds of storm and weather during the same months and days of each year. The solar energy is augmented or modified, in its effects on the earth, by the presence or absence of the perturbing equinoxes of the other planets. All these equinoxes are perpetually shifting their times into all parts of our year. Storm and weather changes shift with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our sun is small compared with some of the other suns or stars outside of our solar system. Yet there are 2,357,127,702,000 square miles on the surface of this magnificent and powerful body; and the mass of matter contained in it is 332,160 times greater than that of the earth. No wonder its influence is so great upon our planet, though its distance be about 92,000,000 miles away from us! But we know also that such energy of light, heat and power that we get is to a large extent dependent upon the valency of our earth; for it is the unit of attraction, the drawing power or affinity, that the sun and earth have for each other, that makes it just as it is. Who will deny that there is superior, infinite knowledge and wisdom back of such an arrangement as this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7 he Wonders of the Moon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpHE moon accompanies the earth, swinging around it in corkscrew fashion, about 240,000 miles away, year in and year out. The light we get from it is reflected light from the sun. When it begins to rise between us and the sun it is at new; it gradually increases until it fulls</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e&amp;&amp;t</span><span class="font6"> at sunset; it then becomes old and begins to wane until it passes out ©f sight in the glare ©f the sun. From new to full takes about fourteen days, and from full to now about fifteen days. The greatest speed is from first quarter to third quarter, but it slows down considerably after passing third quarter. At new the moon is directly behind the earth; at full it is directly in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have full moons far south in summer, full moons far north in winter. New and full moons are always near the equator in March and September. New moons are high in the heavens in summer, and lew in winter. An almanac study of the monthly movements of the moon is instructive and entertaining to both old and young. One writer says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands ed beys and girls, growing tip fete intellectual observation ®f things around them, will be pleased if we tell them why Ged causes the full moon to be far south in the summer and far north in the winter. Remember that the axis of the earth is so inclined to the ecliptic as to make the. winter nights very, long and dark. This, you know, is the case with our winter nights in the northern heuaisphere; and the big, bright full moon is always high up in our northern sky, flooding the long nights with her silvery light. But when our summer returns our nights are very short, and the full moon hangs away over to the south. This is because the people on the south end of the earth are having their winter at this time with long, dark nights, and God in His wisdom and goodness causes the full moon to sail down into the southern skies and send its beams straight down upon the southern hemisphere. This is only one of many benefits resulting from this wonderful law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Th© moon is north and south -of the equator each month, but it fulls in the south when they have their winter (in July), and in the north when we have our winter. The third quarter w south of the equator in spring, and north ©f the equator in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Atmospheric tides, like ocean tides, fellow the moon in its declinations north and south. Hence the storm periods that eome while the moon is moving south of the equator are much more liable to be followed by changes to cold, boreal conditions; for the atmospheric currents tend, from north t© south, bringing the cold out of the north, so to speak. When the moon is coming north the temperature will slowly rise, and the winds will be from south to north, if other causes do not interfere -with this normal ex</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">pectancy. As a rule, when the moon is en the , equator the storm periods d® not bring changes of temperature; but at such times electrical storms are much more liable, even in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If, during a storm period (Vulcan period) the moon is either full or new on the equator, er at north or south declination, the storm will be severe, with rain or snow and strong winds. If this is embraced within a Mercury or Venus period, dr both, the intensity is increased ae-cording to relative positions. New and full moons on the equator come at the equinoctial periods, and therefore cause perturbations out of the ordinary as compared with other seasons of the year. Electrical storms, earthquakes, cyclones, seismic disturbances and other pho-nmnena are the normal things to expect at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, earth’s equinoxes. If it is in the spring leek for heavy snow and blizzards in the west and north; if in the autumn look for rains and wind out of the west and south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the moon is at full, in perigee (point nearest the earth) and north declination, the tides and tidal waves reach phenomenal proportions on the North Atlantic; a reversal of this in the south makes high tides for the southern hemisphere. When the moon is on the celestial equator (over earth’s equator) in any of its phases the tendency is toward increased storminess, cloudy and threatening weather, electrical displays, and changes to warmer or cooler, according to season and other causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thunder showers and gusts of wind are always liable in summer during the moon-on-the-equator days, intensified according to the positions of Mercury and Venus. If barometric pressure is uncommonly low anywhere, especially in the southern states at such times, the storm will b® sharp and quite severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vulcan, Mercury, Venus</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HETHER there is actually a planet Vulcan close to the sun’s rim matters not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is certainly between the sun and Mercury some periodic influence which marks off time so precisely, causing atmospheric disturbances so pronounced, that weather predictions may be based upon it. The Vulcan period is the regular storm period ; in between these periods are the reactionary periods. A Vulcan period runs for five days, with an interval of about seven days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">This five-day and seven-day phase marks off the time from one Vulcan equinox to another. Hence the revolution of Vulcan around the sun takes approximately twenty-four days, going at a slightly greater speed than the rim of old Sol, which takes a little more than twenty-five days to complete a rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From equinox to equinox on Mercury is forty-four days, with the equinoctial “brace-’ or period of disturbance extending fourteen days. From equinox to equinox on Venus is 112 days, with the brace extending twenty days. From equinox to equinox on the earth is 182 days,: with the brace extending six weeks. From equinox to equinox on Mars is 343 days, with the brace extending about seven weeks. From equinox to equinox on Jupiter is 2166 days, with its .influence upon our earth-extending over more than a year. From equinox to equinox on Saturn is &amp;380 days, with its influence extending over three years. The equinoctial periods of all the planets in our solar system affect our weather. Their oppositions and conjunctions affect it also, but the equinoctial influence intensifies the effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The normal condition during a Vulcan storm period is. for the barometer to fall, the ther- • riometer to rise, cloudiness to appear traveling •from west to east across the country in about five days’ time but striking each locality for a very brief period of time, followed by clearing, cooler weather. The condition of the moon and other planets may be such as to prolong the cloudiness and rain for several days over a given locality. Whether there are rains or not the storm conditions will register in the barometer at these intervals of the Vulcan disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mercury periods prolong all disturbances; and oftentimes drizzling rain or snow, mist, sleet or blizzards will be the rule, according to season. Most of the sleet storms come near the Mercury equinoxes, and in the late spring ©r early fall heavy frosts may be expected during such times. The moon on the equator at such times increases the intensity of the storms with added lightning. The tendency during Mercury periods in winter is prolonged cloudiness, sleet and snow; and often such phenomena will fill the gap between the storm periods, especially so if the moon is on the equator or at new. A rising barometer will bring clearing and cooler weather when these storms have spent their force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Venus always brings moisture, either rain or snow, according to season. Our most severe</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">electrical storms, thunder and hail, come near the Venus equinoxes. High winds and often tornadoes are characteristic of such times. The heaviest downpours of rain are liable to come within the Venus brace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These storm periods are introduced with warm weather for the season, rapidly falling , barometer; and they close with rushing eu&gt;-rents of air from the northwest with changes to - ■ unseasonably cold weather. If the moon is on the equator or at new during such storms, force , will be added to the change to colder. Venus, <sub>; </sub>Mercury and the moon in combination for max- &lt;&nbsp;imuna storm conditions prolong the storms &lt;and make them more universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Storms will be characterized by violent gales ; on the great lakes and Gulf of Mexico. West .• Indian hurricanes and tornadoes are also move . commoB under these conditions. Nothing short of heavy downpours of rain with lightning need be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. Mun, Jupiter, Seturn</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fipiIB conjunctions of Vulcan, Mercury and •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Venus, as we have seen, bring wet weather upon the earth. Now we will speak of the in- • fluence of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. These. ' latter are outside the earth’s orbit; and when they are in opposition ©r exerting their equineo <sub>; </sub>tial influences, dry weather is the result. Whan the “wets” and “drys” are exerting their influence simultaneously upon the earth there is a great electric strain, which may lie relieved by. . heavy storms here and there on land and sea . or by seismic disturbances, earthquakes, or by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Volcanic eruptions. During the periods of these great strains upon the earth something meat break loose somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a rule, the general character of the weather upon entering a Mars equinoctial period will continue throughout the period. If it is warm it will stay warm. Storm clouds may appear, there may be gusts ©f wind and dust, but very little rain will fall. Do not forget, however, that the moon has a voice in the weather program; and if she is in any of her phases on the equator os at perigee, she will be heard. Mars will not retard any storm condition, but will serve as an exciter, with a marked tendency toward dryness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jupiter is larger than all other units ®f ©us ' planetary system combined, and with his several </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">moons has a little solar system of his own. if *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is during the Jupiter equinoxes that we have the greatest weather disturbances. During such equinoxes all weather phenomena caused by the other members of our system are greatly increased and prolonged, except that the trend is toward dryness. Vulcan, Mercury and Venus may be unitedly pulling for rain; yet Jupiter’s influence will be neutralizing the rainfall, and yet will cooperate with the other planets in causing heavy gales, seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The Jupiter periods bring more heat in the summer and more cold in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The influence of Saturn is less perceptible than the other mentioned planets, because of his great distance from the earth. Nevertheless, during a Saturn period a tendency to dryness is noticed. It has been discovered that there are earthquake cycles, periodic times when great earthquakes are more liable than at others; and these correspond almost exactly with the Saturn equinoxes. Uranus and Neptune, because of their great distance away, exert no discernible influence upon earth’s weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Characteristic Monthly Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE periodic changes in relationship between the earth and the sun, from month to month throughout the year, lead to characteristic weather conditions that may be expected in regular sequence, unless altered by other disturbing factors. For example, violent tornadoes may be looked for over the Mississippi valley during the last half of May each year. Daily storms may set in, recurring for several days at about the same hour, during May, winding up with a heavy rain storm, wind and thunder, quickly changing to high barometer and cooler weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Electrical and magnetic forces are excited 'during the first half of June. The earth currents are abnormal at this time, and disturb all wire and wireless communication; smouldering volcanoes are stirred up; and the atmospheric currents are erratic, so that the June solstice storms often rush in from unexpected quarters. The great displays of lightning at this time are mostly harmless, unless a thunderstorm is raging. These electrical displays, as someone has said, “are conserving a wise and munificent purpose of God in adjusting atmospheric changes and conditions so vital to plant and animal life at this time of the year.” 'While April showers bring May flowers, June is the month of greatest rainfall. During June, if there is the cooperation of the inferior planets, the electrical display and rainfall will be intensified. In July come the most ominous-looking clouds, often passing with gusts of wind and little rain. What heavy downpours of rain come will extend over very limited areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">March, of course, has a bad reputation. It is caused by the breaking up of winter, the sun .. crossing the equator northbound, and by the cold currents of surface air going south and currents ' of warm air in higher altitudes going north. These fight and clash each other as the fighting line passes over the country from south to north at this time, until Jack Frost is compelled to hibernate in the far north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The planetary eclipses and oppositions furnish the general causes lying back of weather phenomena; while the trusted barometer, hygrometer and thermometer give the local conditions as they exist day by day. Both factors must be considered in making forecasts. But regardless of whether rain comes in any given locality during a storm period, “the machinery of nature will conform to the periodic law that governs storm movements—the wheels of the weather-mill will go round in their accustomed way . . . whether there be moisture and electricity enough in the ‘hopperi to grind out a rain or thunder storm or not”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">IGNS of a severe winter seem to multiply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the eastern part of the United States there were said to be only three days of sunshine last month, and on those days for only thirty percent of the time.

<p><span class="font7">Millennial Climate</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">N INTERESTING article in the Milwaukee</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">■Journal</span><span class="font6"> indicates hew the climate of the earth may become suddenly transformed. It seems that within the past twenty years an Inversion Stratum of the air has been discovered, which lies six to ten miles above the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is believed that this stratum is ©f new formation. It is lighter than ©ur atmosphere and lies upon our atmosphere like a blanket. While ©ur atmosphere </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">grows</span><span class="font6"> increasingly ©older up to about five miles above the earth, yet the instruments sent up by scientific balloons show that the Inversion Stratum, which begins at six miles up, grows warmer as it rises. It is evidently composed of gases which have risen from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The theory is advanced that what is happening above us is that the gases ©f combustion are ascending above our atmosphere and remaining there. Moreover, they are being constantly added to as combustion increases. In other words man is artificially, by his own destruction of earth’s store of hydro-carbons, gradually restoring the conditions which existed before the flood—placing about the earth a blanket</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The position is taken that the United States cannot continue to burn four billion cubic feet of petroleum every year, and the world cannot continue to burn one and one-third billion tons of coal, without the gases going somewhere. The logical place for them to go is upward until they reach a state ©f equilibrium; and the Lord has evidently so arranged matters that this state of equilibrium is reached just beyond the limits of rarefaction where men can live, and the blanket is coming just at the time when He needs it, if He is to care for all the billions that have gone down into death.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Personal Experiences in an</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">J HAVE thought, as many people do, that earthquakes are interesting; but now the people who live in Santa Barbara and vicinity realize, better than they did, that to see and feel and hear a really severe earthquake is a tremendous and awe-inspiring experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the earth shakes and trembles and jerks and twists as it did here on the morning of June 28th, fifteen or twenty seconds seem a long time. ¥ve know of people here who thought that the last great day had come. Of course individual conditions and experiences were not all the same. In the majority of buildings, large and small, while the earth was going through the convulsions of the quake, pandemonium seemed to reign. I have heard a number of people say that there seemed to be something Satanic about it. Some said that it seemed as though a great monster were shaking the earth as a dog would shake a rat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are terrible -sounds which accompany such an earthquake and whieh are impossible t®</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Earthquake </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Helen Mundy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">describe. In some of the settling quakes which have come at intervals since the hard one, there has been noticed, first, a distant rumbling seed, followed by a trembling of the earth and thf?n by a sudden sharp shock. Sometimes a sudden jerk comes first and the shaking afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even where avails did not fall or the house was not thrown from its foundation many people were more or less bruised by being thrown to the floor or against pieces ©f furniture. My house is a small wooden bungalow, and it was not moved from its foundation, and the chimney did not come down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I had been up a few moments, and was still in my nightdress, when the quake began. I was standing near an open door between two rooms when the shock same, and I did the only thing I could do to keep on my feet: I held tightly with both hands to the door casing. A large heating stove, similar to an open-front Franklin, was moved, several indies from its place; and the stove pipe fell down. This of 'course, waa a small matter, but it added to the din. A lamp on a table went down to the floor, and the shade crashed in pieces at my feet. Books were thrown from the shelves, and dishes from the cupboard. Vases were upset and some of them broken. Similar things happened in adjoining rooms, but I cannot tell now what went down first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a lull of about a second or two in the middle of the quake, and then it began again as hard as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, After it was over I ran out of doors and into (the middle of the street, to get as far as possible Srom the house in case a quake should come again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some much lighter quakes soon followed the first one, but after fifteen or twenty minutes I ventured back to the house to see what the quake had done there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have a good-sized clock, with pendulum, which hangs against the wall. After the quake the clock was still hanging, but many degrees from plumb. It had stopped, and the hands were pointing to the fateful moment when churches, schools, hospitals, banks and all kinds of business places and some houses, too, were -wrecked. ' In one place a “grandfather’s clock” was moved out some distance from the wall, and stood on the rug right side up with care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almost immediately after going into the house I heard the excited cries of the neighbors and went out, expecting to see a fire, as that seemed the most probable thing to come. It was not a fire however, but a flood of water from a large reservoir in which the city kept a supply of water stored. The quake had broken the reservoir, so that a great wall of water had rushed down a canyon, tearing up great trees by the roots and gathering many kinds of debris as it went. The water followed the creek bed and bordering lands till it was stopped by a bridge a block east of this place. The water sought the lower land; and when it reached my front yard, it was about a foot and a half deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not knowing how much water might be coming, the people left their houses, where they could. Some got away in their cars. Others climbed fences and ran for higher ground. Some of the neighbors a block from here waded in svater three feet deep. The water covered the whole of my lot, taking down about ninety feet of fence and burying it under mud and debris. Q?he people in this neighborhood suffered more from the flood than from the immediate </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">dam</span><span class="font6">age done by the quake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is difficult to state just what I thought and felt during the fifteen or more seconds of that furious shaking. I do not know that I even thought a prayer; but I did have a comforting consciousness that what war taking place was a part of what must come at the beginning of the new age; and that “the earth abideth forever”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seemed that no building could stand the strain very long and not be wrecked. Institutions, churches, business houses, etc., suffered most in the quake, while much less damage was done to residences. And there was a surprisingly small number of people lulled. (Likewise, at beginning of the Millennium, ecclesiasticism and big business first suffer, and judgment of individuals will come later.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Generally speaking, it was the larger buildings, especially the ones made of brick and concrete, which could not stand the shaking. Still, some of the larger buildings were little hurt, because they were properly built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We still think that earthquakes are interesting, and many people express the wish that they might experience one, under specified conditions, yet we are convinced that one really hard one would be enough to satisfy most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The- people here are still startled by sudden noises, or a slight jarring of the house or the chair they occupy. Children who were old enough to be frightened, were very nervous for weeks after the earthquake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course many individual experiences, including narrow escapes from injury or death, will never be published. I have heard of more than one instance in which a portion of a brick chimney went down through the roof to a bed which had been occupied by some one only a few seconds before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many strange things happened during the quake. In the San Marcos Building a large mirror, without a frame, went down three stories into the basement and was not broken. In one home there were several dishes of food in the oven of a gas stove. The quake opened the oven door, threw out the dishes of food, and left the door closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The quake was hard on the contents of china closets and canned-fruit cupboards. It is a sorry sight to see fruit and preserves and broken</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JSffiCBMBaB 80, 1825</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">glass mixed together, and it mates the housewife feel sorry to see her treasured china and glassware carried away to the dump heap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of people said that the ground during the quake rose and fell, with a progressive movement, like the waves of the sea. This is supported by the statements of those who say that when they tried to walk, the ground or the floor, as the ease might be, came up to meet them; and that when they tried to take another step they could not reach the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reports of the great damage done to ths eity are not exaggerated, Many whs come here from ether parts of California say that conditions. are much worse than they expected to find them.

<p><span class="font5">“European unrest” is spreading to nature itself, and Europe is naw puzzled with strange manifestations of upheaval and decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">France’s government scientists are studying the recent phenomenon of a plateau rising in the Bay ef Biscay, discovered when mariners taking soundings found they were almost agrousd at a spot where normally they should have had deep water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is only one of a series of mysterious occurrences in nature noted throughout Europe recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For instance, one side ef that tremendous pile of rock, the Matterhorn, in. Switzerland, has commenced to “move”. Inhabitants of half a dozen villages have been ordered from their houses to escape the danger of falling rocks and a guard of troops has been scattered through the district to warn off mountain climbers. Near Greece, on the island of Santorini, a supposedly extinct volcano has suddenly broken forth into violent eruption throwing smoke, lava and burning stones to a great height and causing a panic among the population. Many of the inhabitants have fled from the viae-dad island, fearing that mors violent eruptions and a disaster would overtake them if they remained. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heligoland, the mighty pre-war island fortress </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font5"> t&amp;a German Empire, is reported crumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-five acres of the Isle of Wight have part faBca into the sea. Three villages on the shore ef the Isle will-shortly have to be moved further inland, while geologists report that the ocean is making inroads against the shore-line of the entire island at the rate of more than a yard a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The statuarf and copings of the Houses of Pariidn meat have suddenly succumbed to a mysterious attack of destructive gases in the air and are crumbling and falling at an alarming rate. Under the same sort of attack, the dome of St. Paul’s cathedral has developed-dangerous points of weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile the waters of the North Sea have become warmer than for many years, and tunny fish, sharks and other semi-tropical species rarely known in this region, have appeared this summer in large numbers in tha Channel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE New York Edison Company and the Brooklyn Edison Company, the gold-dust twins whose duty is to make the greater city spick and span by flooding it with light and furnishing electric power for its many industries, maintain a miniature weather bureau of their own. They have a number of barometric stations situated at advantageous points far beyond and on all sides of the cities’ limits, which automatically report to the light companies the approach of rainstorms or cloudiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is important that the powerhouses receive Buch information at least two hours in advance so that they can start up additional dynamos and generators and be in position to supply the extra demand for current which is always made upon it immediately the clouds begin to settle over the metropolis. Everybody turns on additional lights as soon as daylight is dimmed by cloudiness, and within a few moments the usual daytime demand for current has doubled er trebled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only do these automatic weather stations report the approach of storms by the ringing of a bell at the powerhouse, but the bell rings louder and louder as the storm approaches.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Pennsburg’s Knight of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">P</span><span class="font6">ENNSBURG, Pennsylvania, possesses a Knight of the Twentieth Century. In his home for several days prior to the first of October he had the. very great honor of entertaining two fine young Christian women, engaged in the noblest work of man, that of enlightening their fellows in regard to God's character and plan. They were colporteurs, these two young misses, successful ones too, placing here and there in Pennsburg sets of the Studies ik the Scbiptukes and The Harp of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But as soon as the success of these young women in placing really valuable Christian instruction in the hands of intelligent people of Pennsburg reached the ears of certain ones in the community, our Knight of the Twentieth Century suddenly summoned the two young women and told them that they must go immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His own questioning and their replies filled up two hours; and as it was then dark Sir Knight allowed the young women to remain under the shelter of his roof till morning. Sir Knight has some education in matters outride of the Bible; but for once in his life learned that education in other subjects is no match for an education in the Word of God, which live th and abideth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not know whether Sir Knight was peeved; but we do know that the next morning he sat on his porch and watched the young women, with their heavy suitcases and boxes of books, never assisting with a finger lift; and we do know that he straightway connected with that excellent paper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Town and Country,</span><span class="font6"> which contains an “Editor’s Mail Bag” headed with the apparently just and reasonable provision that “letters to the Editor should be as brief as possible and to the point, avoiding anything that would open a denominational or sectarian discussion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Forthwith there appeared in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Town and Country</span><span class="font6"> a brief letter to the editor from Sir Gallant, who had evicted the two Christian women. It was a very brief letter. Of necessity it had to be, to suit the just and honest editor of the “Mail Bag”. To be exact, the letter contained only a trifle over two thousand words, and could have been written comfortably on only about twenty-two pages of ordinary letter paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is possible that the just and honest editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Town and Country</span><span class="font6"> did not know that these twenty-two pages, “brief as possible, and to the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark38"></a>the Twentieth Century</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">point” contained “anything that would open a denominational or 'sectarian discussion”; because it mentioned “Russellism” as such only eighteen times in the whole letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Knight of the Twentieth Century is the soul of courtesy and Idndness to the two Chris-Gan young women who have been entertained in his home, and whom he takes occasion to mention in the first and last paragraphs of his brief 2,184 word letter. He wants to be fair, this Ptmnsburg gentle man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only terms which he uses respecting the Bible Helps in which these young women ape , interested which might hinder anyone from having proper regard for them are merely that they are preposterous, rank, unchristian, bosh, nonsense, uncharitable, cheap stuff, contemptible drivel, ridiculous pipedreams, illogical juggling, erratic, artificial and ridiculous, fanciful and spectacular hairsplitting, insane pretended knowledge. The Knight uses no other objection- ,. able terms, unless some one might take exception to his reference to “Russell's hand-made Christ ■ of putty” or his expression “Rats”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Toward the young women themselves, who have given their lives to the service of the Lord, he does not seem to have directed any shafts worse than to merely refer to them as dreamers, mentally unfortunates, misled and deluded workers, arrogantly and sanctimoniously putting forth Pharisaism. The Knight of Pennsburg is a Christian! Good Knight!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But now reverting to the editor of the “Mail Bag”. We do not know whether the editor of the “Mail Bag” is Mr. Hillegass, the regular editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Town and Country,</span><span class="font6"> or whether the associate editor, Reverend George W. Lutz, cares for the “Mail Bag”. About Mr. Hillegass we know little except that he permitted Pennsburg’s Valiant Knight to reveal his prowess in a one-sided fight against two young women. But we do chance to know something of interest regarding the Reverend Lutz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reverend Lutz is on record, written record, too, that the teachings over which the Sir Knight raved for twenty odd pages are “advanced and intelligent views”. In conversation with the mother of one of the two dispossessed young women, to quote her words, “He told me personally that he would be only a voice in the darkness were he to say anything from the pulpit.”</span></p>

The mine labor cost of anthracite coal is $4.62 per ton. The consumer ordinarily pays an increase of upwards of $10 per ton ever these costs. The $10 or more go to the railroads which are, in effect, the real owners of the anthracite mines. They also charge more for transporting the coal than they should be allowed to do. When the miners asked for more money the operators had on had 7,000,000 to 9,000,000 tons of coal, for which they have been getting several dollars a ton more than when the suspension took place. Moreover, by substituting round-hole screen for square-hole screen and, in addition, reducing the sizes of the mesh, they are picking the pockets of the public to the extent of some fifteen million dollars annually. It is folly to talk of burning bituminous coal in heating plants made to use hard coal. The poor in New York City, who must buy coal by the scuttle ®r the basket, are at this moment paying for it $30 to $35 per ton. The rich who have their bins filled will not suffer.

Unless the purchasing power of workers is kept at a high level it standsrto reason they cannot make good'customers. It is obviously unfair and impossible that the production of workers should increase and that at the same time their buying power should decrease or remain sta~ tionary. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">onsressman Mastin Madden, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, before the President’s Air Board, showing the eagerness of some of the brilliant military men to spend the people’s money, cited the purchase of 256 pursuit planes by the army which were so constructed that the pilots could not see out of them, but that the defect was not discovered until the deal had been closed! Probably nobody can be blamed for being insane, but it seems too bad that sane hard-working people should have to pay bills incurred by the mentally unsound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Misuse of Pictures</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font6">URING the war photographs of Jewish massacres by Russians taken ten years before the war were published to show German cruelty toward the Foies in Poland. Photographs st ■ the feeding of French prisoners of war were published as proof that the Germans had resorted to the bread line for themselves. A ~ photograph of the Germans having a good time before the war was published a year later under the title of “Enthusiasm and Joy of the Barbarians”. Gradually the truth on all these mat* ters is coming to light. Truthfully it may be <sub>: </sub>said that never did the lie come into; its own as it did in the years 1914 to 1918.</span></p>

The Chief of Im telligence of the British Army during the war in an address before the National Arts Club in New York explained that he started the story by trading the titles of two pictures and getting one of the Chinese newspapers to publish the pictorial lie. One by one the lies come up for review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France's Reign of Blood in Syria</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE French seem to be making a poor showing with their government of Syria. There does not seem to bo much to their government there except force, force, without stint or limit. That is a poor way to get along in this year of our Lord 1925. If it is so difficult for the French to govern the Syrians, why not get out and let them try governing themselves! The Syrians could hardly do worse than to kill their citizens by the thousands, as France did in its bombardment of unarmed Damascenes in their own homes. Through serious blundering no notice of intention to bombard the city was given to foreign consulates, and in at least one instance a sergeant misunderstood his instructions and went down a street through a Christian quarter with a tank spitting machine gun fire from both, sides. French homes were quietly visited by officers and their inhabitants taken to places of safety; but British and American citizens, t® the number of several thousand, were left to shift for themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">RENCH interest in Morocco is not confined entirely to the wish to give Morocco a better government than Abd el Krim might be able to afford. Morocco has a phosphate deposit estimated at twenty-five million tons; and as Morocco is a heathen country and France is &amp;&nbsp;Christian country, why of course France feels that she ought to have the phosphate. In five years the phosphate shipments from Morocco have grown from 8,000 to 600,000 tons.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark42"></a>More About Sugar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font6">WISH ta eaB attention to the article, &quot;The Case Against Sagar,” by Dr. Philip M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Novell, published in September 23rd issue of The Goi.ben Age. I have been continually employed in the manufacture of beet sugar since 1899, and think that I know something about the business. I point out some ©f the Doctor’s errors:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Beet sugar is not more extensively used than eane sugar. When the beets are received at the sugar factory, no part is removed except a very </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">f&amp;w</span><span class="font6"> remaining tops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Doctor says that the sugar is dissolved in the diffusion process. You will see that this statement is absolutely wrong, in that the juice of the richest beet would not contain more than twenty-five percent total solids so that the sugar could not be there as a solid and could not be dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He says that lime or carbon dioxide is added </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">precipitate some of the impurities. As </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">mat</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ter </span><span class="font6">©f fact both are used, the lime being first mixed with the juice at a temperature of about </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">85° </span><span class="font6">Centigrade and carbon dioxide is then introduced to precipitate the lime. The purpose in the whole process is the removal of all the fion-sugar possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following this process the Doctor says the clear juice is centrifugated. What he means by this I do not know. We separate sugar crystals from syrup by means of centrifugal machines, but the good Doctor has no crystals yet. He also says that blood albumen, bone black and bluing are used to whiten the sugar. I have never seen blood albumen used in the manufacture of beet sugar. We have net used any Bone black for over twenty years. It is eighteen years since we used any bluing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have no objection to what the Doctor </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">evidently trying to prove, which seems to be that white sugar is not a balanced food; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">would not properly nourish anyone. Neither would salt, soda, iron er calcium; but you would not have us cast these substances out of our diet for this reason. I think that sugar is not unhealthy as a food, and it is used in the great-, est quantities in the countries of the world where the people seem the most intelligent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.The sugar made by the company for whom I work is 99.9% pure; and we are all very proud of the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is an important difference between the impurities or crude elements in eane and beet juice. Some may, and do, like the Haver of cane impurities. But no one likes the flavor </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">beet impurities; and I do not believe that beet molasses is ever used in gelatin or jam making. The flavor would stop the sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Beet sugar cannot be sold as brown sugar because all brown sugar contains a small amount of molasses, and brown beet sugar is not pleasant to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doctor Lovell’s last statement, that sugar is the most injurious product in our national dietary, etc., may be true; but judging from his other statements I would be inclined to think that this statement was also at least slightly exaggerated. I have known a number of healthy old men and women who liked plenty of sugar with their meals.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Good Soldiers of Jesus Christ</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is something about a true Christian that marks him as different from other men. Napoleon I, one who knew men, is reported to have said, “If I could get soldiers who would follow me as the early Christians followed Christ, I could easily conquer the whole world.” The Christian soldier is a rebel in an enemy’s country. “The whole world lieth in the evil one.” (1 John 5:19 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font6"> F.) Satan resents nothing bo much as to have one of his subjects turn against him. The Lord puts the matter plainly, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">before anybody enlists under His banner he should stop and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand. During the entire time of Satan’s reign the followers of the Lord have been but a small minority of the people, and they are so today. It is much easier to go with the crowd than.it is to go against it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">to the Lord, the first thing required of the soldier is to part with the things that will be impediments to him in his new line of work. The way the apostle puts the matter is that “no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier”.—2 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more completely one is enwrapped in worldly interests of any sort, the less time he has for the pursuit of heavenly interests. It would be a poor soldier that would spend all his time in writing letters to the folks back home, giving them instructions as to how to run their own affairs. Like other men the Christian is expected to provide things decent and things needful, but to give the remainder of his time and effort and influence to the cause of his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian soldier’s progress is hindered by a life that is out of accord with the principles of righteousness. Hence says the apostle: “Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us.” These words “beset us” really mean “entangle our feet” and are so translated in Weymouth’s “New Testament in Modern Speech”.—Hebrews 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian soldier cannot live as he did before he became a Christian, corruptly and deceitfully, but is told that he must ‘put off concerning the former manner of life, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts’. Some of the things which must be put off, and which, if retained, would disqualify the would-be Christian soldier for any service in the King’s army, are designated by name as ‘anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communications out of one’s mouth’ (Colossians 3: 8, 9) and lies one to another. The Lord does not want that kind of people in His army; and who can blame Him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Putting On the Armor</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N THE sixth chapter of his epistle to the church at Ephesus St. Paul sets before us the different pieces of the Christian soldier’s armor: The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The object of putting on this armor is not fo stand around and admire ourselves or to b© admired by others, and to be idle and useless and worthless. The apostle says that the object of putting it on is “that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand”. Weymouth puts this passage very much clearer: “That ye may be able to stand your ground on the day of battle and remain victors in the field.” (Ephesians 6 :13) There will be fighting, hard fighting; and the one that wears the armor is expected to fight so vigorously as to vanquish his opponent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Espousing the Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HE best soldiers are those that believe most firmly in the righteousness of their cause.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19251230_files/g_E_19251230-9.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The reason why Cromwell’s soldiers swept all before them was that they had such unlimited confidence in their chief and in the cause which he represented. The motive which animates the soldiers of Jesus Christ is love for their supreme King. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”—Matthew 22: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A soldier must first of all be submissive to his sovereign. “Submit yourselves therefore to God.” (James 4:7) And he should be submissive not only outwardly but inwardly. Therefore he is admonished, “Do all things without murmurings and disputings.”—Phil. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He must be an obedient man. “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.” (James 1: 19) And as a soldier with no brains would be of no benefit to his sovereign, especially in an enemy’s country, so the Lord, when sending forth His disciples said: “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” (Matthew 10:16) Having provided us with brains the Lord expects us to make reasonable use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soldier has to depend upon his commander to see that he is supplied with food; and always, at the appropriate time, the Lord has provided things new and old for the household of faith. Concerning the harvest of the Gospel Age the Lord said: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give meat in due season?”' (Matthew 24:45; Luke 12:42) We who are here are here because the Lord faithfully fulfilled that promise to the very letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the soldier gets side he must depend upoa his commander for medical attention. Even the Christian soldier gets rick sometimes. The spiritual food which was onee so much relished becomes repugnant; fevers- set in, disorders' ®f various <sub>t</sub> sorts manifest themselves. In such-an&quot; hour the Christian can turn to his heavenly Father, “who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all' thy diseases,” with full assurance that he will get the needed help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Association with the Commander-In-Chief •</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS not given to the common soldiers in earthly armies to have association with the eommander-in-ehief. The commander has duties and responsibilities which prevent such association, although it is said that Frederick the Great knew personally by name every one of the ten thousand soldiers who constituted his standing army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But we have a very much greater Commanderin-Chief than that of any earthly army. “The Father himself loveth you.” God has said: “He that toueheth you toueheth the apple of his eye.” (Zechariah 2:8) He courts the companionship of the soldiers in the Christian army; and hence our Master said: “Ask, and it shall he given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the soldiers in the Christian army arc warned against taking the name of their Commander lightly upon their lips. They are not to take His name in vain. Solemnly the Lord Jesus says to us: “I say unto you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea: Nay, nay: for whatsoever is.more than these, cometh of evil.”—Matthew 5:34-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Car® must be taken by the Christian soldier to remember that the eye of his Commanderin-Chief is literally upon him at all times. He must maintain such an attitude toward this great. One-as to justify a continuance of relationship, “Grieve not - the holy spirit ©f God, whereby-ye are sealed unto the day of redemp-tion/’—Ephesians 4:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And although the common soldier in- , the Lord’s army may -have companionship with the Commander-in-Chief, he must never forget that he is a private.' His instructions-on this-point are, “Let nothing- be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.”—Philippians 2:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Following the Captain -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">npHE Christian soldier is fighting the same fight that his Captain fought. He is enlisted under the same banner. We read, “His banner over me was love.” It is the soldier’s duty and his privilege to keep under that banner to the end and to follow where Jesus leads the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The way is not the popular way. It is the unpopular way. “Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify th© people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.”—Hebrews 13:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an earthly army the deserter is punished with imprisonment or death. While the Lord seems to be more merciful toward those who drop out ©f His ranks, yet one of His expressions indicates the low esteem in which He holds such; and it is worth noting: “He that is an hi reling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf eatcheth them, and seattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.”—J ohn 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Duties to Fellow Soldiers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N THE armies of the world the comrades in arms get to think much of each other. When the strife is on there is nothing they will nc&gt;t do for their pals; and when it is over they are friends to the end of their days. This is not true of all comrades in arms, but of certain chosen ones—buddies, as they like to call themselves. But in the army of Christ this love goes out to every soldier in the ranks. Indeed, if one is himself a soldier in the army it is impossible for him not to love every fellow soldier* The Lord puts this in this way: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is my commandment, That ye love one -another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath' no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.” (John 15:12-14)’ It will be seen that the Lord virtually asks each of His followers to lay down his'We fox-the' others. That this was the significance of what the Lord had in mind is shown by St. John’s reference to the same thought: “Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.”—1 John 3:16. B. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Love for fellow soldiers will manifest itself in thoughtfulness as respects either their heavenly or their earthly needs. Hence says the apostle: “Believe the necessities of God’s people : always practise hospitality.”—Romans 12: 13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Love for fellow soldiers will manifest itself in kindness toward them. Hence St. Peter’s admonition, “All of you should be of one mind, quick to sympathize, kind to the brethren, tenderhearted, lowly-minded, not requiting evil with evil, nor abuse with abuse, but, on the contrary, giving a blessing in return.”-—1 Peter 3:8,9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Love for fellow soldiers will manifest itself in forgiveness of their shortcomings; and hence; “Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”—Ephesians 4:32, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Things to Avoid in Comradeship</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19251230_files/g_E_19251230-10.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">COMRADE who would betray his friend into the hands of the enemy would be a poor comrade, but he who encourages pride in his fellow soldier in Christ’s army does just that. When the Apostle John says, “Keep yourself from idols,” he is in effect saying, Do not make an idol out of any brother, and thus work him perhaps irreparable injury. St. Paul voices this thought in another way: “Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But as he would avoid betraying his comrade by making an idol of him, so the true Christian soldier will avoid discouraging a true comrade by sitting in judgment upon his motives. “Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you again.&quot;—Luke 6:37,38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Trouble-makers among the fellow soldiers should be given a wide berth. The fact that one soldier is sick is no reason why he should wish' everybody in the army to be sick. The fact that one soldier has already decided in his heart that . he wishes to be a deserter, is no r eason why he should wish everybody in the army to desert; but that is frequently the way it works out. At any rate the apostle says to look out for them. Put them into the guard house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine yhieh ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.&quot;—Romans 16:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And then the good soldiers are urged not to forget those who have given their lives on the battlefield, fighting in the same cause. Please notice particularly this translation by Weymouth of Hebrews 13:7, and its application to Pastor Bussell, whom we all knew and loved so well: “Remember your former leaders—it was they who brought you God’s message. Bear in mind how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord laid down the principle that the right spirit with regard to feasts is to give them to those who would otherwise never have them; and His soldiers have no right to ignore what He said on this point. “When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”— Luke 14:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are people with whom it is difficult to live peaceably. Toward these and toward all, the soldiers of Christ are to be forbearing. “The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.”—2 Timothy 2:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As respects persecutors his attitude is to be one of flight from them rather than battle against them. “When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.”—Matthew 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And when he has his enemies in his power he is not to wreak vengeance upon them but leave the issues with the Lord. “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves; but rather give place un*</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">to w?ath: for it is written,'Vengeance is mine; I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Weapons pfour Warfare </span><span class="font6">will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">drink: for in so doing thou filialt heap coals of fire an his head.”—-Romans 12:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian soldier has a light in his camp which is net available to others in anything like the same degree. &quot;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”—Psa, 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Soldier in Bailie ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A T THE end ©f his earthly journey the Apos-tie Paul said: “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.” (2 Timothy 4:7)' He was eager that Timothy should pursue a similar career and urged him, “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.”-—1 Timothy 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fight of the Christian is against a definite and personal antagonist.' “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring Iio-Xi,, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1: Peter 5:8) In at least two instances in the Scriptures we see this fight pictured as one in which the Christian is on the defensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” and again, Tut ©n the whole armour of God, that-ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”—James 4:7; Ephesians 6:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From these passages we see that every Christian is engaged in the warfare, and we recognize that the battle takes place in the mind. It is only in the mind that we wrestle against principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness and spiritual wicked ones in high places; and at the outset of our Christian careers it is liable to be with us as it was with the Lord Jesus, that the battle is a defensive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But as Jesus in the wilderness fought a defensive warfare against the devil, being forty days tempted to adopt some plan different from that which the Father had marked out for Him; and as He subsequently carried the war into the enemy’s camp by preaching tins gospel of the kingdom throughout the length and breadth of Palestine, so our battles of faith, at first defensive, come later t© be aggressive campaigns for carrying the gospel into the enemy’s country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE weapons ©f our warfare are the same as those which Jesus used so effectively in his battle in the wilderness; i. e., &quot;The word of God, ... sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit.” (Hebrews 4:12) It is an interesting fact that the Bible Students today, and they only, seem, to have the ability to make this distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the Revelation (1:16) Jesus is constantly pictured to us as equipped with this . sword. In the first chapter he is described as having “in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword [the Old and New Testaments] : and his oounto-nance was as the sun shine th in his strength.” In the second chapter He warns the; Bergamos . epoch of the church that the sword of His mouth will be used against them unless they repeat. In the nineteenth chapter the sword is represent- <sub>; </sub>ted as in execution, His enemies falling before Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ conquest of the world in the MiBennfal Age is represented in the prophecies of the Old Testament as brought about by this weapon .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">which issues from His mouth. Thus the Prophet Isaiah (11:4) says; “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.” This slaying of the wicked is not a slaughter of men, but a conversion of them to the truth. Some of us were once enemies through wicked works, and were thus slain by the Lord’s sword. A similar picture is presented in the 45th Psalm, except that in that picture the sword is represented as on the Lord’s thigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Jesus used the sword effectively, s© Jehovah says of some: “I hewed them by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.” (Hosea 6:5) And in the hands of us who are alive this day He has put the sword doubled the third time, and its sharp and glittering point for use as we will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning our defensive warfare, Weymouth’s translation puts very well the Apostle Peter’s statement in 1 Peter 3:15: “In your hearts consecrate Christ as Lord, being always-ready t© make your defence to any one who asks from you a reason for the hope you cherish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the command for offensive warfare, the pushing of the battle of faith into the enemy’s camp, we have the Lord’s directions, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (Matthew 28:19) In the same line is the apostle’s instruction, “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with, good.”— Romans 12:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ths Plan of Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font6">VERY general who ever won a campaign had a definite plan of conquest at the outset; and as the Christian soldier’s battles are waged in his mind, it is appropriate that his campaign should begin and end there. Hence says the apostle; “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what-. soever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think oh these things.”—Philippians 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soldiers in Christ’s army must take good aim. They must aim to be perfect. “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”—Matthew 5: 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soldiers in Christ's army must at all times handle the Word of God in an honest, straightforward manner. Hence says St. Paul to Timothy: “Earnestly seek to commend yourself to God as a servant who, because of straightforward dealing with the word of truth, has no .reason to feel any shame.”—2 Timothy 2:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They must at all times be sincere. “Test yourselves to discover whether you are true believers: put your own selves under examination. Or do you not know that Jesus Christ is within you, unless you are insincere?”—2 Corinthians 13: 5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They must be watchful, courageous and strong. “Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.” “Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.”—2 Timothy 2:1; 1 Corinthians 16:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They must be joyful and confident. &quot;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.” “For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.”—Philippians 4:4; Hebrews 3: 6-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They must be calm and level-headed. “Be careful for nothing; but- in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto Ged.” (Philip-pians 4: 6) “Do not be drawn aside by all sorts of strange teaching: for it is well to have th® heart made steadfast through God’s grace, and not by special kinds of food [spiritual food], from which those who scrupulously attend to them have received no benefit.”—Hebrews 13: 9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Serve and Suffer Deliberately &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">RITING to Timothy St. Paul told him to “provide yourself with an outline of th® sound teaching which you have heard from my lips, and be true to the faith and love which ard in Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 1:13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth^ </span><span class="font6">To the Romans and to us all he said: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”—Romans 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Peter tells us that if we are soldiers for Christ we must expect t® suffer and that we should settle it in our minds to do so. “Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise wuth the same mind: for he that hath suffered [as a Christian^ in the flesh hath ceased from sin.”—1 Peter 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church is promised that its concluding experiences in the earth shall be more severe than at any other time: “Whose voice then shook the earth; hut now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more, sig-nifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made [fabricated, false] that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.”—Hebrews 12: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The true soldier ©f Jesus Christ will fear neither prison nor death. “Fear none of these things which thou shaft suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried;... be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Bev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And it is the privilege of the true soldier ©f Jesus Christ to remember the prize which is to be his at the end of the great fight. “To him that overeometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”—Revela-: tion 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Why the Christian is Keenly Interested in the Return of the Jews to Palestine</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fpHE deliverer of Israel from, the land of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Egypt was Moses, He was also the mediator of the law covenant between God and the people of Israel, Moses was a type of something better to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course God knew that the Jews could not keep the law covenant and that it would not give them life, and that He would cast them off. Why, then, did He make a covenant with them? I answer: For several reasons, amongst which are the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(1) To prove to the Jews, and to all men ever thereafter, that no man can get life by his own efforts. God foreknew the position that would be taken by the Evolutionists and the Modernists, and when the truth is understood it will forever silence these in their claims that man can lift himself up to the perfect standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, (2) It served as a school master to lead the Jews to their Messiah, the Savior of mankind, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(3) It was a type of a better covenant which is to follow, and which is for the benefit of the Jews first and through them all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moses was a type of the greater one that is to follow. In proof of this we read in Deuteronomy 18:18,19: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proof of the fulfilment of one of God’s promises should strengthen faith that the other promises will be fulfilled. In a previous lecture I pointed out a number of promises that God made concerning the return of the Jews to Palestine, which are now being fulfilled before the eyes of all. This should strengthen the faith of the people in God’s Word that He will fulfil all of His promises. Remember that He said: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“T </span><span class="font6">have spoken it, it shall come to pass.”—Isaiah 46:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have, then, the plain statement that the greater one than Moses must come, and that he must be the ruler of the world, and that all who would have blessings must obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the same mighty one about whom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jacob, on his death bed, prophesied as Shiloh, who should be the ruler of the world. Genesis 49:10 reads: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This mighty one must be the Messiah, and about this there has not at any time been a doubt in the mind of any one, Jew or Gentile, who believes God’s Word. All Jews who believe the Bible have understood that the Messiah must first come before the blessing. Messiah means anointed one. The Greek word Christ means the same thing. The question is, Who is the Messiah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Identification</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpHE most important things for Jew and Gen-til® to first determine is, the identification of the Messiah. If the Scriptures give a plain description of him, and it is found from the undisputed facts that follow that a certain one meets every part of the description in detail, may we then not reasonably conclude that such an one is the Messiah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah, through his prophet Micah 5:2, foretold that the Messiah must be born in Bethlehem. Members of the Sanhedrin, the leading ones of the Jews, told King Herod the same thing, showing that they expected him to be born there. (Matthew 2: 5, 6) Jesus of Nazareth was born there exactly as foretold. He was of the tribe of Judah, as mentioned by Jacob in the aforementioned prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Isaiah testified that the Messiah would be a Jew, come to his own people, and would be rejected by them; would be a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; that he would be put to death; that there would be no just cause for his death, yet he would be numbered with the transgressors. Each one of these things Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled.—Isa. 53:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Zechariah, chapter 11, verse 12, foretold that he who would be the Messiah would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver. Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, as foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Daniel (9:27) foretold that the Messiah would be cut off, but not for himself, his words being, “And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sia</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">. to cease.” A week is of seven days, and symbolically means seven years., Jesus was cut off ox’ crucified exactly in the middle of the week, or at the end of three and one-half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet David foretold,in Psalm 34:20 that he who would be the Messiah would die a violent death, but that not one bone of his body would' be broken. Jesus exactly fulfilled these conditions in his death upon the cross. The same prophet foretold that Messiah’s flesh would not corrupt and that he would rise from the dead. (Psalm 16:10) The facts concerning Jesus’ death and resurrection exactly fulfil this prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Redeemer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE Jews made the mistake of expecting the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Messiah to come with a superior army and drive out the-invading forces and establish his government in .great power, pomp and glory. They did not understand that he who was to be the Messiah must first be the Redeemer of the human race; that he must die and rise from the dead. They could not understand it. Why , were his death and resurrection necessary? The answer to this question should appeal to Jews and Gentiles alike, because all spring from Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Adam, the perfect man, sinned, and for this violation of God’s law he was sentenced to death. Ged promised t© redeem mankind from death. The words of the Prophet Hosea 1.3:14 read: ‘ri. will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will ‘be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law which Ged gave to the Jews, through Moses, provided that redemption should be only by a life given for a life. (Deuteronomy 19: 21) It must be apparent to all Jews that their forefathers could not keep the law covenant, which promised them life, because of their imperfection. They must have a redeemer to wipe out the record that stood against them by inheritance through father Adam. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was born under the law, a Jew. He came to do the will of God, just as had been foretold of Him by the prophet: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”—-Psalm 40: 7,8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the will of God, as heretofore shown, that he who should be honored with the office of Messiah must first be the Redeemer of mankind. Of himself Jesus said: “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” Again Jesus said concerning Himself: “There-’’ fore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. Ko • man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings” ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The writers of the New Testament were all Jews, with, one exception. If God could inspire the prophets of. old, who were used to write the Old Testament,, could He not as well inspire others of their descendants to faithfully write the New Testament? The major portion of the Jews in the past have rejected the New Testameat because they have been blinded to its real value. The time is come when they must and will understand it and rejoice. They will come to see that the entire Bible, Old and New Testaments, is in exact harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophets Isaiah, Daniel and David testified that he who would be the Messiah must die and rise from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning what David wrote St. Peter, a Jew, afterwards said: “Therefore being a . prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ [Messiah] to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ [Messiah] that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.” —Acts 2:30-32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Coverlets</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">E HAVE seen that, the blood for the old</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">law covenant was the paschal lamb slain in Egypt on the 14th of Nisan. It was slain instead of Moses, but for Moses. Moses was the ■ • type of the greater one to follow, the Messiah. Of him it is written that h® is the antitypieal • Iamb of God that takes away the sin of the' ■ world. (John 1:29) As a Jew,. Jesus of Naa-sreth must observe, and did observe, the pass</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">over, </span><span class="font6">because it was enjoined by the law. When </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6">had finished eating the last passover He then and there stated to His disciples that His own blood was the antitype of the paschal lamb, and that His blood was the blood for the basis of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n&amp;uv</span><span class="font6"> law covenant. This new covenant is made between God on one side, and Jesus Christ, the Messiah, on the other, in behalf of Israel. It must be made with the Messiah, who is the antitype of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now concerning Jesus it is written: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”—« 1 Timothy 2:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This covenant made between God and Jesus, when on earth, is to be ratified and inaugurated in the antitypical Mount Sinai, the kingdom of God, of which Sinai was a type. Then will follow the blessing which God has provided for the Jews and through the Jews to all the families of the earth. This blessing must come through the seed of Abraham according to the promise, because God thus promised it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mystery</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE Christ or the Messiah, both meaning the same thing, has been a mystery from ages and generations. Not one of the disciples understood it while Jesus was on earth. The time has come for this real mystery to be understood, even by the world. Christ, or Messiah, means anointed body, the antitypical seed of Abraham, which was pictured by the stars of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning this it is written: “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.... For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”—Galatians 3:16, 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God gave the Jews the first privilege of making up this entire body. He made Jesus, His beloved Son, the head of it. For three and one-half years after the death and resurrection of Jesus no one but Jews were permitted to apply for membership in that anointed body. Thereafter God opened the way to Gentiles and Jews alike. When one becomes a member of this anointed class he is no longer a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ET us now examine the time features of the prophecy made by Jeremiah, in which he</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19251230_files/g_E_19251230-11.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">said: “Therefore behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;... For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes. And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double.&quot;—Jeremiah 16:14,17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word “double”, from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mishneh,</span><span class="font6"> means a duplication of time; that is to say, the promise of God was that the Jews must suffer for the same length of time that they had received His favor. We know that His favor began with the organization of Israel at Jacob’s death. If we can find when the double count began then we can calculate the time exactly. In this we are not left in doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through His prophet Zechariah God said: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, 0 daughter of Jerusalem ; behold, thy King cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.... Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">today</span><span class="font6"> do I declare that I will render double unto thee.”—Zech. 9:9,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The date of the fulfilment of this prophecy is not left in doubt for one moment. It was fulfilled on the tenth of Nisan, the first Jewish month (corresponding to our month April), the day on which the paschal lamb was taken up, in the year A. D. 33. The account of that fulfilment is recorded in Matthew 21:1-9, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled &quot;which was spoken by the prophet [Zech, 9:9,12], saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass, and the eolt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David!. Blessed is he that cometh in the ■name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest! And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The beginning of God’s favor, as above stated, was in the year B. C. 1812. Add to that 33 A. D. and we have 1845 years. This was the length of God’s favor to Israel; and there the favor began to pass away. To double that period we must add 1845 years to A. D. 33, which brings us to 1878. That marked, a period in which some favor should be expected to come from Jehovah to the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In that very year, on June 13th, the Berlin Congress convened and was presided over by a Jew, Lord Beaconsfield, Prime Minister of Great Britain; and that congress took the first steps that had been taken in 1845 years, looking to the regaining of the rights of Israel in Palestine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note another parallel of forty years that must be added here. The “double” began to count in A.D. 33, when Jesus offered Himself as king to Israel. There the favor began to pass away. Exactly forty years to the very day thereafter, to wit, A. D. 73, the 10th of Nisan, the last fort of Israel fell and the Jews were completely expelled from Palestine. We should expect to find then some marked favor coming to the Jews just forty years after 187§.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now forty years added to 1878 bring us to 1918. It was in the spring of the year 1918 that Dr. Chaim Weizmann, acting under authority issued to him from the British government, landed with a commission at Jerusalem, and began to lay the foundation of a new Jewish government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be it noted that since the year 1918 there has been a great awakening amongst the Jews throughout the world concerning the rebuilding of Palestine. Thus we see exactly on time and in harmony with His promise, God is returning His once chosen people to their homeland. Jews and Christians alike should rejoice in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore the Jubilee system, which Ged inaugurated with Israel in Palestine, which required them to let their land re-st every fiftieth, or jubilee year, and on which year every man should have restored to him what was lost, has reached a climax in 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ged required seventy jubilees to be kept, and seventy times fifty are 3500 years. This 3500 year-period ends with the year 1925. Therefore 1925 is a marked year in the world’s history and particularly with the Jews, and it was to be expected that, something unusual would transpire concerning the Jews in the year 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the 12th of March, 1925, the Palestifis Steamship Company began, the operation of its steamship line from New York to Palestine. J*j flies, for the. first time, the Jewish flag, whidli carries ©n it the star of David. Large numbers •f Jews are now settling in Palestine each month, and the work of rehabilitating the Holy Land has this year begun in real earnest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bttndneas in. Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HY were the Jews cast off as a nation? I answer : Because of their blindness to God’s promises and because of their unheHet'. There was a remnant @f Jews who accepted God’s promises and were not east off. Who were the chief ones responsible for the Jew<sup>y</sup>s, as a people, failing to see and understand the Scriptures? I answer: The clergy of their time, Pharisees who pretended to represent God. and arrogated to themselves all knowledge of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Down through the Gospel Age many professed Christians have persecuted the Jews, They have said all manner of evil things against them. That was due to their ignorance. Whj has been chiefly responsible for this misunderstanding and misrepresenting ©f the Jews! I answer: The clergy of modern times, who have arrogated to themselves the ability to understand and the authority to interpret the Scriptures to the exclusion of all others. In St. Paul’s day some of them were of the same dispositi&amp;u. Foreknowing that others would be of this type, he wrote: “For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant ©f this mystery, lest yo should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall tom away ungodliness from Jacob.&quot;—Romans 11: 25,26; Isaiah 59:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mark now, he says that this blindness is only partialand has happened until the fulness </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of. </span><span class="font6">the Gentiles be come in. This means, until the full number is selected from the Gentiles who shall compose the Christ, the Messiah—the anointed ones.-—See Acts 15:14 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then what shall follow? The apostle answers: “For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.”—Romans 11:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus Paul shows that then the new covenant will be made, and that through this covenant all Israel shall be saved. It will mean then that the Jews, regathered to Palestine in unbelief, shall understand the Scriptures, receive the Lord’s promises; and then, as the prophet has said, they will look upon Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest event with Christians has been, and is, the second coming of the Lord, the end of the world, and the inauguration of His kingdom. His disciples asked Him what would be the proof of these things and He answered that there would be a world war, famines, pestilences and revolutions in various parts of the earth; that this would mark the beginning of sorrows upon the things of the earth. Then He added that Jerusalem shall be trodden dovzn of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Then, says the Lord, when you see these things come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads, for the time of deliverance draweth nigh.—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We therefore see that the return of Israel to Palestine and the rebuilding of their homeland is one of the strongest proofs that the old world has ended; that Christ the Messiah is present; that the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and that the inauguration of the new covenant is just at the door. For' these reasons the Christian should have the keenest interest in the restoration of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For 1900 years Christians have been the special witnesses of the Lord in the earth. Now they have a special obligation laid upon them concerning the Jews. God’s prophet Isaiah, looking down to the conclusion of their “double” when their suffering should begin to pass away, says: “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.”—Isaiah 40:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the obligation devolves upon the Christians now, not only to know about the Jews returning to Palestine but to tell them that, the day of their deliverance is at hand; that Christ is the Messiah, and that the time of His kingdom is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus describes the disturbed conditions at the end of the world, which we new see, and in harmony therewith God’s prophet wrote concerning this, in Daniel 2:44: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” Again the prophet Daniel wrote: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, says the Apostle Paul, concerning the restoration of Israel: “For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?” (Romans 11:15) What he really means is this: If the casting away of Israel in A. D. 33 marked the beginning of the development of the seed of Abraham for the blessing of the world, now when that work is completed and God’s favor is returned to Israel, it gives evidence that soon the dead shall live again; that those on earth who are alive and obey the Lord shall never die; and this is a further proof that millions now living will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let the Christians, then with gladness proclaim the message of the King and His kingdom. Let them say with the Prophet Isaiah “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”—Isa. 9: 6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning! The glory of the Lord has risen upon her. As Satan’s empire of darkness crumbles before the rising Sun of Righteousness the true Christians, as witnesses for the Lord, confidently and joyfully sing out: The kingdom of heaven has come! Let Jew and Gentile be glad and rejoice! The day of deliverance is at hand J</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>&lt;Sflrf</sup>’his new creation had its beginning with Jesus Christ at the time of His baptism in Jordan when He was begotten to the divine nature and anointed with the holy spirit without limitation. As a man, He was pure, blameless, holy. At the age of thirty years, He was qualified wider the law to be a priest, and there He consecrated Himself and at that time was baptized and begotten to the divine nature, hence became </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">new creature there from the divine standpoint. As a new creature He was made perfect by the things which He suffered.—Hebrews 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">''<sup>70</sup>From the time of His baptism He was opposed by Satan the Devil, who sought to destroy Him. The reason for this opposition lay in the fact that when God sentenced Adam t® death He had said unto Satan: “I will put enmity betvzeen thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shaft bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15) The woman here symbolized </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font6"> typified the Abrahamic-Sarah covenant, from which the seed of promise springs. As Isaac was the son of promise, so the church was typified by Isa&amp;e. (Galatians 4:25-29) The seed of promise is therefore the new creation. The seed of the serpent consists of those agencies visible and invisible which are his offspring, and which are used by him for his wicked work. la Jesus’ day the scribes and Pharisees and doctors of the law were classed as the offspring of Satan, his seed (John 8:44); and it has been true at all times that, many who have pretended to be Christians are really the seed of Satan and engage in persecuting others who love the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘^Immediately after the baptism of Jesus He went up into a mountain in the wilderness to study God’s plan and to meditate upon it, that He might be instructed in the way that Jehovah would have.Him go; and when this season of forty days was ended and He came forth, He was subjected te a great temptation by the Devil. Jesus resisted all of these efforts of Satan. (Luke 4:1-13) Jesus, the Head of the seed of promise, was the target of Satan’s instruments. For three and a half years He suffered daily at the hands of Satan and those who represented him; namely, those human beings who possessed the devilish spirit. During that period of three and a half years He was indeed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; but all this suffering was necessary for His perfection as a new creature. (Hebrew’s 5:8,9) Because of His faithfulness, His fidelity and loyalty to God even unto death, He won the great victory, became an overeomer. Hence we read: “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the same of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should eonfes® that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Philippians 2:9-11) The members of the body of Christ, the members ©f the church, must follow in His footsteps.—1 Peter 2:21. -</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We cannot do less than to say that this latest book by Judge Rutherford fs an Epoch-making book. It comes at just the right time—at the close of Israel’s long period of waiting for the Jubilee of Jubilees. The seventy Jubilee periods have expired. The time for the blessing of the Jews has come. The blessing itself is here in this wonderful book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book is not only for the Jews. It is for them, very much so, but it is for Gentiles too. They need to have set before them the Old Testament evidence of the Plan of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford has done just that in this book. Those who have read it regard it as in many respects the most remarkable thing he has written, Send orders to us or to</span></p>

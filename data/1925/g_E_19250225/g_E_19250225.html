<p><span class="font7">States Senate, is a real American, sure enough; for his grandmother was a full-blooded Kaw Indian lass. Curtis was reared in an Indian village, later became a horse jockey, then a hack-driver and finally a law student and a successful lawyer in Topeka, when that city was yet young. He has been in the United States Senate seventeen years, and is acknowledged to be one of the brightest men in the country.</span></p>

Feodorovna or Vladimirovitch (we are not sure of the name), has paid the United States a visit, and has probably had a pretty good time. While she was here the Vanderbilts and Bakers feasted and entertained her, giving her the best that unlimited money can command ; but otherwise she never made a dent in the American body politic. Her hubby, safe in Bavaria, claims to be the new Czar of Russia; and while Mrs. Feodorovna was here, some were foolish enough to hail her as the Empress. Cheap show!</span></p>

He advocates the exclusion of all automobiles from the Park, the carrying of the east and west traffic underground and of the north and south traffic on widened streets on the sides.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font7">OTHING like this ever happened; but it clearly illustrates what is happening. It has a basis of facts, and the calculations are reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to the flood there were ten patriarchs. The years wherein they lived, according to the true Bible chronology, were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam ....................4129-3199</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seth .....................3999-3087</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enos .............. &nbsp;3894-2989</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Methuselah ...............3432-2463</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lamech ................ &nbsp;&nbsp;3245-2468</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Noah, to the flood..........3063-2463</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Methuselah arrived on the scene Adam was getting well along in years; in fact, as the record shows, he had only 233 more years to live; and realizing that he was growing old he said to Methuselah’s father: “Enoch, you have always been a good boy; and now that you have an addition to your family I feel like doing something for your child, John D., Jr., my new great-great-great great-great grandson; so here is $1. I would like to have you put it out for him at interest; and when he is old enough, I would like to have him go into the banking business. I think that there is a lot of money in that business, if properly handled; and I will be ready, as long as I live, to give my best advice as to how to safeguard the fund. My boy Seth wants to borrow $1 from me right now; so we will lend the money to Seth at 6 percent interest. We will let him have it on a sixty-day note; and then at the end of that time he will renew the note, with the interest added; and so on indefinitely.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">DAM saw that he was starting Methuselah off on a profitable path. While it had looked at the outset that Methuselah was going to make only 6 percent on his money, yet in actual practice the money had doubled itself in ten years and six months, so that, allowing for a time or two when the note went to protest, and thus brought additional revenues to the young financier, Adam discovered that Methuselah would normally double his money every ten years. In a little while, then, as things went at that time, Seth’s notes on January 1st of each decade were as noted on next page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On January 1st, 3332, Seth came around to Methuselah and said: “It looks to me as though you are asking too much for the use of that 'dollar that you loaned me a hundred years ago today. I had no idea at that time that it would cost me over a thousand dollars for the use of that dollar for a hundred years.” But Methuselah had begun to see the value of his scheme; so he talked Seth into leaving the note, the same as usual, and let the money pile up, multiplying at the rate of over a thousand times a century, and took a mortgage on Seth’s home, to make sure that the interest and principal would all be paid some happy day. From that time onward business seemed to pick up rapidly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">N JANUARY 1st, 3232, Adam came around to see how Methuselah was making out and was surprised to find that he had just renewed Seth’s note for the tidy sum of $1,048,576, and to learn that Seth had been compelled not only to give a mortgage on everything he owned but to borrow large sums from his children and his grandchildren to provide the collateral necessary to secure the loan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a little while (as things went then), namely, in only a third of a century, as Adam was ill, at the point of death, he sent for Methuselah to find out how the interest plan was working; and when Methuselah told him that Seth’s note at that time was for $10,150,215.68 and that he</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">held mortgages on all the then existing real and personal property, of every sort on the whole earth, excepting Adam’s own house and the bed upon which he way lying, Adam just curled up and died. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indeed, Enoch himself had become so uis-heartened at the way things looked that he, too, left the scene, sick at what he saw coming on the earth, and remained here only fifty-seven years longer. But in that time the bonds and bills receivable, mortgages and other collateral, in Methuselah’s hands had grown until the total was now $536,870,912. And the original dollar was still out at interest, working as hard as ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HEN the third century came around, January 1st, B. C. 3132, ten years after Enoch had left the scene, the notes had reached to the sum of $1,073,741,824, and Methuselah was as wealthy as the wealthiest man living in the year 1922 A. D.; but unlike him Methuselah was only nicely started in life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From this point onward things seemed to come Methuselah’s way. In the next century, down to the time of Seth’s death, which was a period of forty-five years, the notes came, rolling in. When Seth felt that he was slipping away, he sent for the young banker to find out how much he really owed him for the loan 345 years previous; and when told in a stern banking tone of voice that it was on that date, January 1st, 3087 B. C., a sum total of $26,815,832,425.92, Seth gave one gasp; and they sent for the undertaker.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Four Centuries Would Buy the Earth</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS only a little while longer to the four hundredth anniversary of the loan. This period soon passed; and when it was expired, January 1st, 3032, the total securities in Methuselah’s hands, covering all the admitted indebtedness of Adam’s posterity, was the magnificent sum of $1,099,511,627,776. This was enough, and more than enough, if invested in a World War, to make the world safe for plutocracy. But Methuselah had more sense. lie concluded to put it into the real estate business; for he knew that, with his interest-machine workingly properly, the world was safe for big business anyway until something happened, . , ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looking the matter up in the Rand-McNally atlas of the time, and confirming it by the “World Almanac”, Methuselah found that the total land surface of the earth is 54,807,420 square miles, which, at 640 acres to the square mile, amounts to 35,076,749,800 acres. He purchased the whole outfit at $30 per acre, and had the deed recorded; but as it all belonged to him anyway, he did not have to pay out any money. It was just a matter of bookkeeping. But even according to the books he had $47,209,133,776 left over, after buying the whole earth at $30 per acre, and without ever having done one stroke of work himself, all as a result of a “wise investment” of $1 left to accumulate by perfectly proper banking methods for a matter of 400 years.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>How Could the People Pay It?</span></h6>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Y THIS time Methuselah had acquired the appetite for making money. He had learned the interest game thoroughly, and he now went in for it in a large way. During the next four centuries the fortune which he amassed in notes and bills receivable, mortgages, bonds and other collateral on all that was in the earth or ever would be in the earth was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jan. 1st, B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2932__.1..$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,125,899,906,842,624</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">2632 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this point Methuselah thought it was time for him to begin to build, and so he decided to build a fine house on each acre of land that he owned. Figuring the matter up carefully he found that on every acre of land surface of the earth, as a result of his frugality in letting that $1 work for him steadily for 800 years, he was able to erect on each acre a building which, would cost him just $34,465,160,155,879 per acre; and allowing that there would ultimately be 50,000,000,000, of Adam’s posterity born, this would be at the rate of $689.30 for each one of them for each acre of the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not being blessed by nature with any more sense than the law allowed, being ignorant of about every item except how to keep his old interest-machine working, Methuselah started to build, using only solid gold, at $27 per ounce, for his building materials. His gold cost him, delivered on the job, $648,000 per ton.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250225_files/g_E_19250225-14.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">

<h6><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>256 Tons of Gold to the Square Inch</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">IGURING up how much he would need, the old gentleman found that in every acre there are 43,560 square feet of land and 6,272,640 square inches. He reckoned up to see how many tons of gold he could afford to stand on each square inch of the land surface of the earth, and discovered that to place one ton on each square inch he would be loading down each acre with a plate of solid gold amounting in value to $4,064,670,720,000. But as he had more than eight times as much wealth as this on hand, why should he care? So he started to have the work done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About this time his grandson Noah came along. We say about this time, but actually it was some forty-nine years later, and the building operations were already under way. Noah asked his grandpa how much his wealth was at this time, and was told that business had been good since Methuselah began to build, because he now had thirty-two times as much, and that therefore he intended to put 256 tons of solid gold on each square inch of the earth’s surface, instead of only eight tons as he had originally planned.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Erecting the Gold Standard</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250225_files/g_E_19250225-15.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">OAH tried to reason with him; but the old man was getting cross and childish, and seemed to think that because he was in the banking business nobody else knew anything. So he roughly ordered Noah off the premises, meaning that he should get off the earth. Thinking the matter over Noah perceived that the only thing he could do was to take to the water; so he and the boys of the family got to work on their boat. They worked as hard as they could; for they could see that the old man was getting crazy and that things did not look a bit good for anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime Methuselah continued to do a good business. His little nest-egg had so grown by the time his 900th birthday came around that it was the neat figure of (if the pencil didn’t slip somewhere) $1,237,940,039,285,370,274,899,124,224. This wealth caused the old man’s mind to go back on him entirely; for he found that, building as hard as he could, it was impossible for all the inhabitants of the world to erect the gold as fast as it came flowing in. Therefore he determined to do something that would make his name remembered throughout all time. He had all the gold that could he possibly handled brought into one place; and there he erected on a plot a mile square a building of solid gold, which he called The Gold Standard.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>‘‘As It Was in the Days of Noah”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE great pile grew like magic, and kept get-ting higher and higher. They put in electric elevators and ran them like the wind, trying to keep pace with the delivery of the material, lifting it up and placing it in position. They had gotten up about seventy-nine miles when something happened. Probably nobody will ever know just what it was. Some said that the tower was built too rigidly; it could not stand the strain of the great wind which blew away the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor. Others said it was because the foundation was laid in blood. Anyway, to the horror of all onlookers in the year 2463 B. C., it swayed a few moments, gave a sickening lurch, tore a big gap in the canopy, and came down with a roar, burying Methuselah and all of that civilization in the ruins. It fell, and great was the fall of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And when the canopy was torn, down came the waters, ocean deep, floating Noah and all his family to safety. If you look the matter up, you will-find that Methuselah died the year of the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We reiterate the first statement of this article, namely, that “nothing like this ever happened”; but we leave it to the reader to judge whether or not any civilization can endure which is built upon the interest basis. There-will come a time when the burden cannot possibly be borne. The World War has made the burden </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">already</span><span class="font7"> impossible. In a little while the great tower will fall and bury civilization in its ruins. When that time comes the only happy people on earth will be those who have learned well the lesson that the Word of our God which liveth and abideth forever is better, far better, than any image of gold that supposedly wise but indescribably foolish financial people of the world have erected or can ever erect for their happiness or protection.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Our Rural Schools</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">UT in Western Kansas lies a very fertile valley which is owned mostly by the Garden City Beet Sugar Company, and which is inhabited largely by uneducated foreigners, who rent the land and raise the beets for the mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within this territory lies the the little hamlet of Holcomb. Here was an ideal spot in which to build a model consolidated school, the character of the inhabitants of the locality being such that they might easily be prevailed upon to take the entire dose. The Sugar Company did not care. It could increase the rentals or “hike” the price of sugar to meet the extra tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Doubtless similar schools in other sugar districts have contributed their bit towards making the latter course possible, and this may account in part for the higher prices on sugar in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Octopus” came and saw, and the deed was done. The bonds were voted. The one-room school buildings in the region w<sup>T</sup>ere moved into the little town, and utilized in the construction of some of the buildings. A fine school building, a teacherage, and a home for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">superintendent were built. Reo busses were purchased, and a garage maintained for them. The gymnasium, the play-room, and the bathroom were not forgotten. The initial cost was reported to be $225,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A consolidated school course includes a four-year high-school course, in our state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When all was in readiness, lengthy first page articles appeared in “The Country Gentleman” and, later, in “The Kansas Homestead”, describing the Holcomb school plant and extolling its virtues over the usual one-room rural school. Other prominent publications joined in the sobs over the inefficiency of the one-room school—these same one-room schools which have turned out many of our brightest stars in history, the strongest men and women our modern times have known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many editorial tears, also, were shed over “the poorly paid teachers”. As far as the teachers are concerned, they have always fared as well, if not better, than those who furnished the money to pay them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus was launched the campaign for con-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">solidated or, at least rural, high schools in every agricultural locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many parents were easily prevailed upon to vote for the schools because they believed they were paving the road to easier lives for their children than they themselves had enjoyed. There was some opposition, however; and the gerrymandering and other schemes practised to put these new schools on the map were enough to make Satan dance for joy. ■ Thus were profitable tax-free investments found for a vast amount of funds accumulated by “big business” when the world was being “made safe for democracy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much twaddle has been printed about “the great American charity”, and “the sacrifice that pays”. The woman who gave to charity the money which should have gone to buy her small child a pair of shoes, can hardly be commended for the act. Is it not just possible that charity untempered by judgment may fly wide of the mark and do more harm than good? May it not be that the system which keeps young men and women on charity's roll even after they have finished the grades, is at fault?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Gradually Changing to Play</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE high school course may be all right;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">but, judged from appearances, it is designed to eliminate as much work and introduce as much play as possible. One $60,000 high school did not have enough students to fit out a creditable team for the games; so they went out into the highways and byways, and gathered in youngsters who were even below the seventh grade and promoted them into the high school, in order that the school might have a place in the contest games.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How can our students become deep thinkers or even fair students if they are continually keyed up to the highest pitch of excitement over the games? The last game played is hardly out of mind until the new contest looms up. Besides these, there are also many social affairs, both in school and out, to exercise their influence on the pupils’ minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Physical culture should by all means have a place in our school; but its true object is defeated in these brutal contest games, which strew the way with thrills and cripples. The youngsters are taught that total disregard of consequences to their own bodies in order to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">win a game is heroism. We do not question that there are times when physical sacrifice may be praiseworthy; but should there not be a higher object than the mere winning of a game to prompt it ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The young folks are “wild” to get into high school. They accept what work is necessary, in order that the institution may be called a school, that they may enjoy the “thrills” which the courses include. If they can not be players, they may be “boosters” in the contest games. This means long car rides and many jolly hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the moment our children enter school, they are feasted upon “thrills”. Their very reading lessons are full of thrilling and often impossible stories. No wonder they find ordinary life intolerable, and start out occasionally to manufacture some thrills of their own, as did those two rich young Chicago students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In districts where these schools exist, they reign supreme. Parents and others are expected to bow to their every mandate. They will brook no interference, excepting the pupil’s own illness, with his school activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No students are excused from the games unless upon a doctor’s certificate stating that they are physically unable to take part in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plenty of time may be taken for games and “hikes”, to say nothing of “weenie roasts” and four-o’clock breakfasts, held in lonely, out-of-the-way places, often with doubtful chaperonage. But one day missed from school activities by any pupil for any reason except his own sickness cuts down on his credits. Consequently there are few young hands anywhere to help even their parents in any emergency. Many instances might be cited of mothers seriously ill, and fathers doing housework and tending the sick and the little ones in addition to their own necessary work, in order that almost grown daughters may not miss a day of school. When father is sick, mother milks cows and feeds pigs; for son must not lose his credits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In times past, son or daughter could have “made up” the lessons missed, but the extra strain this would put upon them would never do now. All kinds of sacrifices are made in order that the school activities of the pupil may not be interfered with. Evidently modern parents readily learn self-sacrifice; but when are the youngsters to learn their lessons of unselfishness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One is not considered a good citizen if he does not attend the contest games occasionally and contribute towards their upkeep. If the pupils want anything extra, they get up a food sale or something similar; and the public is expected to buy at generous prices to help the “kids” out.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Passing through Abnormal Conditions</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">ITH a Fourth of July picnic almost every day, with the old folks to do all the work, and with all their bills paid with little or no effort on their part, are we not giving the young generation a very thorough course in selfishness? Growing up under these conditions, with no weight of responsibility to control their actions, are we not producing an abnormal race? In our efforts to build up a race of physical giants, are we not producing one of moral dwarfs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In our state a teacher must have completed this high-school course. Is is any wonder that our one-room schools are deteriorating? The efficient teacher is a rare article, and is what he is in spite of, not on account of, his modern educational training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An ex-county-superintendent, in answer to a woman who was deploring the fact that her children were not doing what they should in school, writes in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Drovers’ Telegram,</span><span class="font7"> of Kansas City, Missouri:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Household,-.</span><span class="font5"> I would like to say to ‘Evergreen’ in your issue of July 22 that the only thing that will do her children any good in the way of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">school is a good teacher. By far too much emphasis is put upon the school building or the number of teachers, rather than the quality of teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The child is not benefited by the consolidated school to the extent that “boosters” claim he is. Dealers in building material, heating plants, lighting systems, school furniture, school “busses”, etc., are benefited very much, as are also architects, contractors, plumbers, insurance and real estate agents; and they spend time and money boosting these things because it pays them to do so. Educators advocate the same things because it generally means the employment of more teachers, higher salaries, less work, more conveniences, and more congenial surroundings for the teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bulk of expenses too often falls upon the already over-burdened farmer, who is in the minority and can not help himself, especially if he owns land in a district containing a town. He lives a life of drudgery and sacrifice in order that these people may have modern comforts and conveniences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good teacher will teach a good school in a one-teacher country school building. If she is no good there, she will do no good as a teacher in the grade school. The so-called trained teacher is many times a farce, trained ■ only to shirk her duty and to ask more salary for so doing. There are some good teachers, however, true and tried, who are worthy of the profession, and whose service is invaluable. It it a difficult matter to determine who the good teachers are; but send the child to a good teacher, no matter what the school building might be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An expensive school building will not educate your child any more than a modern church building will make him a Christian or than a massive tombstone will carry his soul to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The teacher is the school, the whole thing, and the only thing that will help your child; and the country school might have a better teacher than the consolidated district, or it might not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The course in Jehovah’s school, which began its sessions some 6,000 years ago, is full of peculiar and difficult problems to solve. The student is tried to the utmost limit of his powers, and often goes down to the grave seemingly a failure. The course allows some pleasure as we go along; but the bulk of instruction requires much effort, and is along most sober and humbling lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Great Teacher sees to it that each get* the experiences he needs to insure his creditable passage in the final test, that of the judgment day. Some will fail, it is true; but their failure will be because they are too much the children of Satan, and on no account may it be laid upon their loving Instructor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the graduates of this school have received their diplomas and with them the gift of “unspeakable joy”, and are ready to launch out into eternal life, will they begin immediately' to look for “white collar” jobs ? Will they steadfastly' refuse anything in the line of work which they' consider not on a level in genteelness and salary with their educated abilities; choosing rather to live in penury or upon the generosity of friends than to accept a position they think is beneath them? Or will they stop to ask: “Where am I most needed in the world’s field of labor?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Which will be the paramount question with them? Will it be, “How can I best serve myself?” or will it be, “How can I best honor Jehovah and serve my fellow creatures?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will domineering inefficiency prevail then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The model educational course is outlined for us by an all-wise Creator. Is it safe to vary the proportions of work and play, until the law goes forth from Jerusalem?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE art of writing in some form or other is old. Just how old it is is hard to determine, but it was an old, old art when paper as a vehicle for the expression of ideas and the keeping of records came into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably one of the earliest examples of the use of paper is the “Gharibu ’1-Haidth”, an Arab treatise on the rare and curious words in the sayings of Mahomet, written in 866 A. D. It was not until the eighth century that paper was available or much used by any other people than the Chinese, who are perhaps, the earliest known makers and users of the substance. Just when they first practised the art of manufacture is lost in the mists of antiquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Originally, paper was made from cotton, flax, rags; and later, as the demand necessitated larger and larger supplies, esparto-grass, the fibres of many plants, such as rice, straw, papyrus, etc., were used. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With regard to the use of paper in England, it seems to have been fairly common in the fourteenth century. Brown paper was purchasable in 1570, according to old account books of that date; and an early reference (1519) to blotting paper is found in Horman’s “Vulgaria”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Blottyng papyr serveth to drye weete wryttynge, lest there be madeblottis orblurris.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Modern papers are made from a variety of substances. Esparto-grass, straw, flax, hemp, jute, and cotton are still used in considerable quantities, but the principal source of supply of raw material is the forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A visit to a modern paper mill is an education in paper manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Imagine a stream of paper averaging fifteen feet in width flowing out of a machine at the rate of three-quarters of a mile a minute! This is the production of one plant which is only a unit in a number of such plants producing paper for one newspaper only! What the combined production of all the paper machines in the world must be staggers the imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The processes through which the raw material goes before the finished product is produced are many and varied. The preparatory processes are the longest; for the manufacture of paper from the pulp to the roll is a matter of moments only. It is the production of the pulp which consumes the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two kinds of pulp are manufactured, ground wood and sulphite pulp. The process through which the wood goes is considerably different, but a mixture of both kinds is necessary for good newsprint paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the manufacture of ground wood pulp, the small logs in their natural rough state are carried on chain and trough conveyers from the piles to the drum barkers for the removal of the bark. These drum barkers are large cylinders of heavy plank slats on the inside of which angle irons are bolted; and these are revolved in a trough of water. Streams of. water also play on the logs as they roll around inside the drums. As the bark is knocked off against the angle irons it is washed away, and the cleansed logs are conveyed to the grinders to be reduced to pulp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The grinders are machines in which the logs are held by air pressure against revolving grindstones, and are literally ground to pulp. This ground wood pulp is washed out of the bottom of the grinder to the screens, which remove slivers, pieces of bark, shims, etc.; thence it is carried to the deckers, which thicken the pulp and remove the surplus water.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Converting Pulp Into Paper</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250225_files/g_E_19250225-16.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE sulphite pulp is manufactured by a much more involved process, but the resultant product is of a better color and a longer, stronger fibre than the ground wood pulp. It is this long fibre which is desired, as when mixed with the ground wood it adds strength and tenacity to the sheet. In this process the soft part of the wood is dissolved away from the fibre as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wood is clipped into about five-eighth-inch pieces, and carried to a sulphite digester to be cooked. This digester is a large steel shell which is filled with chips mixed with calcium bisulphite acid, and cooked under 70 lbs. steam pressure for about nine hours. This cooking process reduces the chips to a fine, long silky fibre called “sulphite”, which then is screened and deckered as was the ground wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mixing next takes place. Ground wood to the amount of 75 percent of the whole is mixed by great revolving paddles with 25 percent of the sulphite fibre at a consistency of 3.25 percent in water, and into the mixing ingredients is introduced a quantity of basic blue and sulphite of alum. The blue coloring neutralizes the yellowish tint of the ground wood pulp, and the alum sets the color to the fibres, which otherwise would be washed away as the water is separated from the pulp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next the pulp mixture is passed through the Jordan machine, which brushes the fibres out more uniformly and destroys all dry lumps. From the Jordan machine the mixture is fed into one side of a fan pump, and white water fed to the other side at a constant head. The pulp leaves this pump so thin that it flows like water direct to the paper-machine screens, the last safeguard against slivers, lumps or foreign substances which might up to this point have entered the pulp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pulp is now on its final journey, which from screen to finished roll is a matter of seconds only. The thin sheet of water-burdened pulp flows into the head box ol the paper machine under a slice bar which keeps the quantity graded to an even thickness, and which is adjustable. Under this slice is a 65 mesh bronze Fourdrinier wire screen which permits water but not pulp to pass through. From this sieve the “water leaf sheet” passes over woolen felt wringers, or press rolls which squeeze the greater part of the water out of the sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the last of these press rolls the sheet, still wet but of fairly even texture and substance, goes to the drying rolls, hollow cylinders heated by steam under seven pounds pressure. Here the sheet passes over one and under another for the length of the machine, twenty or more rolls, to the calender stack rolls, which polish the paper slightly, giving it a better surface for printer’s ink. Some paper receiving more of this polishing is called super-calendered, and is of a fairly high finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the calendering stack the paper is wound and rewound into rolls to a size of about 35 inches on either steel or wood core, covered with heavy coarse paper, weighed, marked, and numbered, arid loaded into cars for shipment. During the winding the cutting to size is automatically done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is a necessarily brief sketch of the process of manufacturing the newsprint of our daily papers. Other papers, rag rind cotton stock, hand-laid vellums, etc., are made by entirely different processes, in which many more hand operators are called for, thus necessarily increasing the cost of manufacture, even as the quality is enhanced. A visit to a newsprint mill, however, is a splendid breeder of respect for that carelessly handled and often despised “piece of newspaper”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HOUGHT is the brain in action. The brain consists of the soft mass of nerves, the grey and white matter in the cranium, and is subdivided into the cerebrum, the cerebellum and five lobes. The human brain differs from that of the animal by virtue of the greater number of convolutions, or impressions wherein the faculty of memory has its origin. It was at one time supposed, and so taught in medical circles, that meditation, conception, ideas or deliberation, was the result of chemical activity, intercellular. It is now demonstrated that chemicals are too slow in action to permit rapid calculation, and this is proof that thought is conducted by an electronic vibratory method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Abrams was the first actually to demonstrate that theory through a mechanical instrument. It also explains the hitherto mysteries of so-called mental telepathy, mind reading, and woman’s intuition, of which Pastor Russell spoke upon several occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People of strong mental intellect may attune their mind with the vibrations of another and sense that other’s thought. This is frequently also called a “co-incident”, and can be tested by looking at one person intently for a few minutes; and that person will sense that vibration being played upon him. Others can merely think of another person and not see him, and he will sense the vibratory reaction. It is dangerous to carry these tests to completion, however, due to the wily darts of the evil one and to the tremendous influence of the hypnotic and spiritistic cults. The two should be kept entirely separate; for they are entirely distinct. But due to our finite minds, it is most difficult to distinguish sometimes between them, and therefore it is advisable not to experiment with such a master mind as Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thought may be basic for every form of activity. It alone distinguishes between a genius and a fool. At first, thought is developed through most difficult, steady persistence; and later it becomes a habit. Small affairs in men’s lives have changed the entire trend of their lives, by changing a thought and then a habit. Words and actions are crystallized thoughts, words being but vehicles of expression, and may betray the true thought of the individual. As one has expressed it: “Your character speaks so loudly that I can not hear what you say.” Another has said: “The greatest prayer which a man is capable of rendering to his Maker, may be merely a frame of mind, without the utterance of a syllable.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Testing High and Low Qualities</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7"> PERSON may test good music by placing a saucer of grain, or any small round object, on the piano, and then playing popular or ragtime music. Soon the grain will be entirely mixed up, without any regularity or design. Then if classical music is played, there will be formed a perfect design, such as seen in a lace curtain, etc. This can be further demonstrated by unrolling a roll of player music; and without looking at the name of the piece or playing it, one can determine whether it is ragtime or classical by the design which the perforations form in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This illustrates essentially what occurs to the brain of individuals who habitually think of only base, vile things, and those who have the uplifting experiences. It explains why the character of men can be described in terms of facial features, known as Physiognomy, or cranial characteristics with the scientific term of Phrenology, or even by the fingernails or by the palm, or by the spine, or by the feet. There are books published on each of these arts separately; and if we were only sufficiently intelligent we undoubtedly could determine what a person thinks or does chiefly, his qualifications, etc., merely from a piece of his skin, a hair, or a drop of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abrams scientifically demonstrated this fact in many details, although experiments are as yet in their infancy. The body throughout tells our story of life; the vibrations show what we are, and do not lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the mind is capable of severely punishing the body, even unto death through fear, anger, madness or hatred, has amply been demonstrated. Undoubtedly many doctors have brought thousands of patients to a permature grave by telling them that there was no hope of recovery; and many others have had their lives prolonged by hope inspired by their physician. Pastor Russell cited a case of an experiment where a man died of heart failure, who thought he was being bled to death, but who really only had water dripping over his arm. Men have turned grey-haired in a moment through terrible fright. The Christian Scientists heal in many cases by merely changing the mode of thought, by giving the sufferers encouragement, which is nothing but a good brand of psychology, although they attribute it to “divine healing”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ENUINE happiness is a mental attainment. It may be temporary or permanent, depending entirely upon the degree to which it approximates that of the spiritual attributes; namely, the fruits of the spirit, particularly perfect love. Man’s mind was designed to be “in the likeness of Jehovah”, according to Genesis; and consequently the possibilities of good are unlimited. As the result of the original sin, we might conclude that mental possibilities of sin are incomprehensible. This can be better appreciated by reading a treatise on the thousands of appetite perversions, the term appetite being applicable in a broader sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human brain may be likened to a radio set complete. It is a broadcasting as well as a receiving set. It is capable of ruling out interference from the outside world, or of being entirely negative, or even of being entirely out of range and not attuned with any other instrument; or if the brain( broadcasting station) be of sufficient calibre, it can demand the entire attention of not only the nation but the world. Think of the millions at one time affected by any decision of Emperor Wilhelm and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Great mental attainment is a slow, steady process, although it may not be given the opportunity of material expression; but then when released appears to be a rapid accomplishment. In spiritual or worldly affairs, life is as we shape it. It is the maimer in which we accept experiences, the angle at which we view problems, and our conception of right and wrong, or in other words, the degree to which our conscience is educated.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>New Fumigant Found to Destroy Weevils in Wheat</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">(Page 823, “Chemical &amp;&nbsp;Metallurgical Engineering,” Nov. 24,1924)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">OUR volumes of ethyl acetate with six volumes of carbon tetrachloride has been found by the Bureau of Chemistry to be an ideal fumigant for the destruction of weevils in wheat. It is non-flammable and non-explosive, and leaves no objectionable odor in the flour or other products made from the grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new fumigant was discovered as the result of an extensive research to find something to take the place of the highly flammable and explosive carbon bisulphide, which was used extensively for fumigating grain but the use of which in fumigating box cars loaded with grain has been prohibited by nearly all the railroads in the country, except at a few isolated points, because of the danger of fire and explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tests were made of more than one hundred organic compounds and various combinations of these upon three species of grain weevils and the Indian meal moth, before discovery of a suitable fumignat that was non-explosive, nonflammable and without injurious action on the grain or the products manufactured from the grain. This new mixture kills practically 100 percent of weevils in wheat loaded in box cars, when used at the rate of not less than forty pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of air space. At present prices the mixture costs ten cents a pound. Figuring the average box car to have a capacity of 2,750 cubic feet and to be loaded with 1,300 bushels of wheat, the cost of fumigating will be less than one cent a bushel or, to be exact, eighty-five cents per one hundred bushels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the old carbon bisulphide method, because of the danger of explosion or fire, has been outlawed by the railroads, except at two terminals, and allowed there only temporarily as an emergency measure, it is apparent that but for the discovery of a safe effective method for fumigating, the practice of fumigating in cars would soon have been discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Busy Wasp </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Tom C. Cowan (Scotland)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font7">UCH has been said about the ants, and about the surprising work they might be able to perform, were they as large as cattle; but very little is said concerning the wasps, which are just as active as the ants. Like the latter insects, they have their architects and their soldiers. The survivors of the winter months fly about in the Spring, actively preparing for their future colonies; and woe betide those who upset the vespiary, as the nest with its inhabitants is called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The neuters are the busiest class of the community; for they build the nest, gather provisions, and deal out punishment to trespassers. Their thievish and revengeful nature earns for them the enmity of the rest of the world. But that is nothing to them; they are quite capable of looking after themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some tiipe ago a plow cut through a vespiary. The wasps soon made their indignation felt, and it was as much as the plowboy could do to pacify the startled horses. Several hundred of these ferocious insects on the warpath would, without doubt, throw an entire cavalcade into confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the workers are not occupied in collecting food, which is fairly shared, they are employed in the enlargement or repair of the nest, an operation which is performed with velocity and regularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certain foreign species of wasp place conical knobs of different shapes and sizes on the outside of their nests. These decorations are supposed to ward off the larger enemies, while the entrance hall is so constructed as to eliminate all possibility of an invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been stated that the wasps in South America collect honey which, although agreeable to the taste, is of a poisonous nature. In this country, also, they are very fond of honey; and to obtain supplies of it they make a sudden attack on the beehives. The bees are weaker than the wasps; and, taking advantage of the unguarded entrance to the hive, the latter insects enter in a body and levy contributions. Hornets attack the bees when laden with honey, and carry them off prisoners, to whom no mercy is shown. If the captive is too heavy for them, they lighten the weight by cutting off the head and limbs. Wasps adopt the same measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Like the ants, wasps have sentinels to give the alarm should danger arise. But if these guards are killed, the neuters do not attack.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Economic Value and Raising of Skunks </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> Bohnet</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">NCE thoroughly despised and under ban by farmer, poultryman and sportsman, the skunk is now recognized as an asset in the community it inhabits. Not only does the skunk prey upon insects and pests destructive to crops, but it produces fur of great value, especially desirable in Europe. The muskrat alone exceeds it in total value of fur production, the silver fox and mink being next in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Captive skunks are readily raised; and when correctly handled, they become a source of considerable profit both for breeding purposes and for peltage. They can be made as tame and harmless as cats and dogs—house pets. The skunk is a very different animal from the fitchet weasel, commonly called polecat, which inhabits Europe and which has an offensive odor. The polecat of Europe is far more destructive to game and poultry than is the skunk of America, which in Europe is practically unknown, save for its pelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People are naturally prejudiced against the skunk, as against hawks, owls and snakes; and change of opinion has been very slow. Testimony now is in favor of this animal; and legislation tends to its protection, about twenty states having a closed season. These prohibitive laws were passed at the request of farmers who recognize the usefulness of skunks in the destruction of injurious insects and in deference to the desires of persons interested in. conserving the fur product. A better understanding of the economic value of these animals would probably result in protective laws in every state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a rule skunks breed but once a year; in rare instances do they breed twice. The demand for skunk pelts is constantly on the increase, particularly in Europe. Skunks are found all over the American continent; but the smaller species (spotted) is found mostly in the lower and western portions of the United States, and throughout Mexico. The common large skunks are not found outside of the North American continent. There are nine species, with eight subspecies. The more northern forms have the finer fur, and the pelts are graded according to the amount of white in the peltage. The No. 1 grades are those in which there is no white except a small spot on the head or neck. The No. 2 skins have a narrow stripe which extends half way to the tail. The No. 3 skins have narrow stripes the full length of the body, while the No. 4 are broad striped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The northern skins are the more valuable, the peltage being finer and the black color more glossy and intense than are those of the southern climes. The skins measure from one foot to two feet in total length, and are about one-third as wide. In the fur trade the skin of the small spotted skunk is known as “civet”, and is becoming more in demand for garment dressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skunks neither climb trees nor swim streams unless forced, but are fond of bathing in shallow waters, and if held in captivity should have a bathing- place. They have plantigrade feet and strong claws, well adapted for digging in the earth, although preferring to inhabit the holes that other animals have dug and natural rock cavities or stone-wall recesses. Or they go into hollow logs and stumps or under a building, especially if the floor is warm from a stove in the room above. They are like cats in this respect. Under a country school house is a favorite place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skunks are mainly nocturnal. Usually they emerge about sundown, and in summertime seek for food such as frogs, clams, June-bugs, grasshoppers, beetles, locating them largely by their sense of smell and hearing. They dig grubs and other larvse from the ground, leaving the ground surface pitted with small conical holes where the insect food was found.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Scent Glands for Protection</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font7">KUNKS, like other musteline animals, have glands which secrete a nauseous fluid which is their protection when attacked. This extremely offensive fluid is ejected in small jets of spray from six to ten feet. These glands consist of two oval-shaped sacs, located just under the tail beneath the skin, one on each side. They are covered by muscular envelops, and open to the surface through ducts, one leading from each sac. When an enemy approaches, the skunk turns its tail towards the intruder, lowers its head close to the ground, elevates its tail over its back like a squirrel; and—well, you had better stay twelve feet away, or afterwards wish you had not gone so near the innocentlooking creature. Its glands are about as large as a marble, and it carries sufficient ammunition to put an army to precipitous flight, and the discharge from the rear battery clings persistently to whatsoever it touches. If hit in the eye temporary blindness results; but it is the nose that sutlers most. Chloride of lime removes the odor from one’s hands, but ruins the clothing. Gasoline is about the best thing to use, or benzine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The large skunks mate in February and March, and bear litters of from six to ten in the month of May usually. The kittens are born nearly hairless and blind, and do not open their eyes until about thirty days, when they follow the mother about, and stay with her until nearly full grown. They mature in six months, and breed the following Spring. The little skunks are very acute and make nice little house pets. They are much prettier than cat kittens, and they are harmless. They move about much like squirrels.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>What the Skunks Eat</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE general belief that skunks feed mainly on birds and birds’ eggs is incorrect. In sixty-two analyses of skunk stomachs made by the Biological Survey, grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and their larva; formed the larger percentage and most important items of food, and in many instances formed the sole diet. Fifteen of the animals had eaten rats, mice, moles and gophers. Three had eaten carrion; three had taken lizards and salamanders; three crabs, two fungi; two earthworms; six berries and other fruits. In only one were feathers of birds found, and this skunk had been trapped in a henhouse. Two stomachs contained centipedes, sawflies, and cicadas only. These sixty-two stomachs were from animals captured in every month of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The insects eaten by skunks were mostly of injurious kinds. There were army worms and caterpillars and other injurious pests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Minks and weasels kill poultry, and the skunks share in the plunder by eating the dead bodies after the killer has sucked the blood; and the farmer blames the skunk. It is rarely that a skunk takes a chicken. The skunk can not climb to a hen-roost, and would kill only birds found on the ground, and then only one at a visit. Having once tasted chicken, a skunk will nightly return to the poultry house to get more. In skunk yards chickens as large as robins are often found eating with skunks from the same pan, the skunks never molesting the chickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skunks are very fond of honey, and will readily rob beehives, and the nests of bumble bees and yellow-jackets. They do not much mind the stings, but capture the insects that entangle themselves in their long hair. If the beehive is two feet above the ground, a skunk will not disturb it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The No. 1 skunk pelt commands generally a market value of from $2.00 to $4.00; a No. 2 pelt from $1.00 to $3.00; a No. 3 pelt from $50 cents to $2.00; a No. 4 pelt from 25 cents to $1. Most of the pelts go to European markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The oil of skunks is salable for medicinal purposes and is used for rheumatism and throat affection, applied externally, though there is no great demand for it. Indians and trappers have been known to eat skunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people believe that skunks throw their scent with their tail. Not so. The skunk will not defile its tail, but throws the tail high over its back and lets fly its nauseating fluid at the intruder. A quick sharp blow across its back paralyzes the hind part, and prevents the discharge, or, if the skunk is box-trapped, it may be drowned in deep water with safety.</span></p>

The odor is not to be taken into account; but if the breeder prefers to do so, the scent gland may be removed as easily as the spaying of dogs and caponing of roosters. The animals then are as harmless as eats. This should be done when the kitten is weaned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skunk enclosures should embrace an acre of well-drained sandy hillside and tree-shaded for fifty adult skunks. It is well to have running water within the enclosure. A poultry nettingfence four feet high will suffice to confine the animals and to keep out stray dogs, but should have at the top a one-foot overhang inwards; netting of one inch mesh is needed to keep the young ones from escaping and also prevent rats from entering. The fence must penetrate the ground three feet, or the animals might dig out. If well kept, the skunks do very little digging. Within the enclosure there should be wide planks for them to dig under and nest; or a trench dug and covered with boards or planks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The large enclosure should be subdivided into smaller yards, or pens, and one male allowed to run with six or eight females. Also a separate breeding-pen should be provided, and one for weaned kittens; these of one and one-half mesh poultry wire, and three feet in height. Cheap boxes with good dry floors make good breeding-dens, with a small run for young skunks to exercise in and to obviate cannibalism in the yard. Artificial burrows can be bored into sloping bank with a post augur; and the skunks will enlarge it and fit it for habitation. The fur improves with soil contact. Occasionally a wholly meat diet must be given; more of it in the Springtime, to stop old skunks from eating the kittens. Food is obtainable from hotels, restaurants and meat shops at low cost or free. Green corn and mush make desirable feed; fresh milk is excellent; curd of milk is very good. A dead carcass should at no time be placed in the enclosure for skunks to feed upon. Give them only just what they will eat up clean each time. As much as a house cat eats is enough for a skunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One skunk-breeder forgot having left one of his skunks to itself in a 50x100 feet pen. It was there two months before he discovered its presence. He entered the pen, lifted up the dirt-covered plank, and found underneath it a female with eight No. 1 kittens three weeks old. The mother skunk had subsisted by preying upon crickets, beetles, caterpillars and June-bugs that had invaded her pen. These she had taken at night, hiding in daytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one occasion this same breeder had fed meat to the weaned kittens; and upon his lifting up the trench cover they started to come out, every one of them foundered and walking stiff-legged as though on stilts. They all died —about thirty of them. He knew better after that than to feed the babies meat. Skunks should be fed only once or twice a day. Food vessels must be kept clean to avoid disease; and plenty of fresh water given for drink and bath. Two males in a single run will usually fight, and should be kept apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Captive skunks have poorer fur than have wild ones, unless rightly handled in as natural a state as is possible. The young ones are weaned in two months. The fur is prime in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To transfer skunks from one pen to another, the keeper lifts them by the tail, grasping the appendage close to the body rather than near its tip, or he drives them from place to place without being handled. They are docile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skunks are not easily skinned; might as well skin a pig. The same process is employed as when skinning a fox or a muskrat. The pelt is pulled off whole from the tail to the nose. Care must be taken not to cut into the scent bags. The tailbone is of course pulled out; and salt or alum dropped into the pocket and shaken about to prevent putrefaction. The skin is then pulled upon a stretcher of wood or bent springwire for drying in a shady place, not in the sunshine. All fat adhering to it can then be scraped off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people speak of other people as being “skunks”. Quite complimentary, as skunks are among the cleanest of animals, much cleaner than sheep or rabbits. Skunks should not be spoken of disdainfully. They are clean animals and are very gentle and unobtrusive, can be made the cutest and tamest pets. Only when roughly handled or badly frightened, will they show fight and odorize.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>FROM CANADA</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">HE matter of Church Union continues to agitate the minds of a portion of our citizenry. Anti-Unionists, in practically all cases Presbyterians, hold enthusiastic meetings to keep the old Presbyterian creed in existence. Not in forty years has the Westminister Confession been so fondled and toyed with; and stern old Scottish Presbyterians of a former day would rejoice if they could see the passionate devotion of a portion of the modern church which bears their name, to a creed and a shibboleth the very existence of which many who today loudly shout for it scarcely knew existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To see again a parade of the outworn fanatical Calvanistic Puritanism of fifty years ago is pitiful. To read and hear the venomous attacks upon their erstwile associates in the church, while deplorable, is scarcely more or less than we expected. To see the political party spirit fostered and engendered under the able, though covert, directions of the prince of politics, Satan himself, who for this purpose disguises himself as the spirit of truth, and couches his insidious propaganda in the passionate phrases of religious patriotism, is to witness again the age-old play which makes its perennial appearance upon the world-stage. Always the main issues are covered up; and the shouting populace go hunting up every bye and close, chasing the usual will-o-the-wisp of mob violence, and wreaking vengeance upon every passing wayfarer whom the imp of perversity points out as a possible victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To read the newspaper reports of the antiunion meetings, to hear the flatulent statements of every disgruntled clergyman and woman orator is, to the patient observer who has no party interests at stake, a striking example of misdirected zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How many of the agitating clerics have, in the past twenty years, preached sermons based on the Westminister Confession of Faith, or would support it in all its avowals of belief ? The intolerable situation which was in existence among the Presbyterian clergy for so many years, we believe, has had much to do with their support of a union in the bringing about of which the old creeds would be scrapped and a broader, more flexible basis for faith instituted. We believe that many of those ministers recognized their equivocal position, and that their acceptance of a system of belief “with mental reservations” grew completely intolerable. In throwing off the old fetters, however, they appear to be welding new ones upon their spiritual limbs; for their new creed contains much of the older form of unscriptural interpretation, being saturated in “immortalism” and “trinity-ism” and with only the vestiges of a vague hope for mankind in the return of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Methodism accepts the new idea with an easier grace. Their broad doctrine of “free grace for all” falls quite naturally upon this emasculated creed bed which contains so much of “freedom”—freedom to interpret Scripture, to be modern or fundamental as best suits the personal idea, to preach salvation with or without the redeeming blood as a prime necessity. Congregationalism which, so far as the layman can read, has never possessed a distinctive or individual creedal character, except in some minor matters of church organization, follows the stronger groups as a matter of course. It adds nothing of value except in numbers of adherents and value of property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to whether the United Church of Canada will enrich in any way the spiritual life of Canada is a matter of conjecture among its adherents. Some hope that it will; the majority, however, have such elementary ideas of what is meant by the spiritual life that they generally ignore this angle of the matter, preferring to accept such benefits of a material or emotional nature as union may bring, asking little and content with less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the excitement of this period in the history of union has died down, the United Church of Canada, being no better equipped than its predecessors to present the truth of God’s Word to a people who hunger for other food than politics and platitudes, will see with alarm still dwindling congregations, uninterested microscopic audiences, the highways full of pleasure automobiles on Sundays, and the golf courses, parks and “lawful” amusement places thronged with good unionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pessimism? If you call it such. The Lord has declared himself in no uncertain terms against the modern church, without favor or exception. They are utterly doomed, and patchwork will avail them nothing. Their day is over, and their end draws near. May it come soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an editorial in the St John, N. B., </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph-Journal,</span><span class="font7"> Mr. Thomas Leary, retiring president of the Canadian Credit Men’s Association is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Bribery and corruption, crookedness in officialdom, in political, industrial and business life, are lessening the faith of the people in their leaders, and the result will be that, some day, there will come into the limelight a leader who will smash every democratic institution you have and the people will back him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We desire to assure Mr. Leary, whose former position with the Credit Association has no doubt opened his eyes to the situation, that tho leader is on his way. The Lord’s kingdom is at hand, and inequity and injustice are slated for the toboggan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, as individuals, and as a nation, bow down and worship the god “Precedent”. We dare not step aside from the beaten path and strike direct to the goal. The following poem, culled from the columns of the “Western Home Monthly”, and credited to Sam Walter Foss, illustrates the point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Calf Path</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One day through the primeval wood A calf walked home, as good calves should; But made a trail all bent askew, A crooked path, as all calves, do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trail was taken up next day By a lone dog that passed that way;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ And then a wise bell-wether sheep Pursued the trail o’er vale and steep, And drew the flock behind him, too, As good bell-wethers always do. And from that day o’er hill and glade, Through those old woods a path was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And many men wound in and out, And dodged and turned and bent about, And uttered words of righteous wrath Because ’twas such a crooked path; But still they followed—do not laugh— The first migrations of that calf, And through this winding wood-way stalked, Because he wabbled when he walked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the same in religion. Because our forebears went to some particular church, we go. Personal investigation is at a discount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A striking example of the editorial viewpoint of the international liquor traffic is shown in a cartoon which appeared in a Portland, Oregon, </span><span class="font5">This forest path became a lane That bent and turned and turned again. This crooked lane became a road Where many a poor horse with his load Toiled on beneath the burning sun, And traveled some three miles in one. And thus a century and a half They trod the footsteps of that calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each day a hundred thousand stout Followed the zigzag calf about; And o’er this crooked journey went The traffic of a continent;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A hundred thousand men were led By one calf near three centuries dead. For thus such reverence is lent To well-established precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A moral lesson this might teach, Were I ordained and called to preach; For men are prone to go it blind Along the calf paths of the mind; And work away from sun to sun To do what other men have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">newspaper and is commented on by the Vancouver, B. C. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun.</span><span class="font7"> The picture illustrates a bar, with a lady bartender marked “British Columbia” and a customer in a loud suit labelled “American Booze-runner”. The lady offers a thousand cases of liquor delivered at the border. The bootlegger suggests ten thousand; but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">the editor points out, the picture is incomplete. He suggests:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There should be a few stars and stripes added to the dress of the lady, because seventy-five percent of the rum-runners operating out of British Columbia are Americans; and over the door of the booze emporium there should be a sign of ownership: “The proprietors of this saloon are 50,000,000 Americans whose illicit thirst lies at the basis of the whole rum-running business.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But we suppose that Americans and Canadians both would rather spend millions in extra taxes for law enforcement than they would commence some system of education which would have as its objective the eradication of the demand, and the consequent end of the supply. When each citizen of Canada throws every ounce of his influence into the balance against booze, the doom of John Barleycorn is sealed, but not until then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Canada, the land of the Free, loves its shackles, as is shown by the statement of the cost of upkeep of one of its out-of date British traditions. We have a Governor General who represents the King of England, and is appointed (but not paid for) by him. The paying is left to the people of Canada, and comes high. The bill for one year’s expenses is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interest on Rideau Hall (his residence) $250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salary (one year), &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48,666</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The last item is good. We wonder what it calls for. Over half a million per year to keep one amiable English gentleman fed and housed for a year is an expensive luxury when we consider that our citizens, because they cannot eat regularly, leave the country in droves to get jobs in the U. S. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Freight rates in Western Canada are again a subject of heated discussion; and protagonists of the present Government urge that nothing be done to alter a situation which the antagonists of the system produce the law and the prophets to prove is utterly discriminatory and unfair. Largely the war rages about the cities of Moose Jaw, Regina, and Calgary, which are favored as against Saskatoon and Edmonton, which are penalized, or so they think. That such discrimination exists is easily discernible when one studies the rates on certain commodities. For instance, fruit originating in Vernon, B. C. can be laid down in towns 350 miles apart for precisely the same rate. Grain also is moved east from Moose Jaw to Fort William at 20^ a bushel; while farmers shipping from Watrous, 25 miles away, pay 24^. The agitation in the West and demands for freight rate revision may finally force action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Telephonitis is spreading rapidly in Canada. For every hundred inhabitants, there are eleven phones. This is, we believe, the highest percentage of any nation in the world. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sir Frederick Williams-Taylor, General Manager of the Bank of Montreal, at the annual meeting of the bank in December said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Business generally in Canada is unsatisfactory, but with some bright spots. That generally trade is dull, to put it mildly, is no delusion- Many of our industries are running on half time, with diminishing profits, or no profits at all. Taxation is heavy to an extent which discourages new enterprises. The cost of living is high, and our population in point of numbers is at a standstill or worse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He also referred to the fact that commercial borrowings were $100,000,000 less than a year ago. “This,” he said, “was a matter of national importance.” It certainly was a matter of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bank </span><span class="font7">importance, as their six or more percent on those few millions was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the West there is a probe into the coal situation, and some sensational testimony is brought to light. One large Winnipeg dealer claimed that so many obstacles were thrown in his way in importing coal that he was forced to order 10,000 tons from West Virginia. He alleges that a combine exists in the West to kill off all independent dealers. It has been a current rumor for several years in the West that the Alberta mine owners controlled the distribution of the coal, and thus were able to pass it through several dummy companies so as to exact additional tribute from the ultimate consumer. It is to be hoped that the present investigation will disclose the truth or the falsity of this report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HERE was one, wise in his time, who said: “When thieves fall out, then honest men get their due.” Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the International Bible Students Association, which has the name of being somewhat “down” on the churches, were to stand out and singling the Methodist Church as an object of attack, declare to all and sundry that said church was “an apostate church”, many of the superholy peace-at-any-pricers would hold up supplicating hands and call on heaven to witness that these pestiferous Bible Students were at it agaih, destroying the faith of the dear flock in a wonderful church, vilifying great and good men, pillars of that church, and so on ad libitum ■—or ad nauseum, as you happen to see the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently “An Open Letter to the Members and Adherents of the Presbyterian Church” appeared, properly signed—none of your petty anonymous epistles this—in which the following pungent paragraph appears:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The beliefs of the church depend on the pulpit; and what the colleges taught yesterday, the pulpit teaches to-day. We have shown by quotations from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Guardian,</span><span class="font5"> the official organ of the Methodist Church, </span><span class="font4">by tracts </span><span class="font5">published by the authority of the General Con</span><span class="font4">ference, </span><span class="font5">by the text books used in Victoria [College, a Methodist seminary] and the published utterances of one of her outstanding ministers that the Methodist Church is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">an apostate church,</span><span class="font5"> that it no longer be</span><span class="font4">lieves </span><span class="font5">in the atoning death of Christ, or the inspiration of the Scriptures or the infallibility of Christ. The Methodist Church of today no longer has a message for a sin-burdened world-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fellow members of the Presbyterian Church, are you prepared to hand over your money and your church property, to have them used to teach an emasculated gospel, which declares that our Lord was mistaken and fallible, that He did not die for sinners, that He only set an example and that we must save ourselves by our works ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Shall we send this message to the heathen and maintain colleges for its propagation ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence our quotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The letter is long, too long to quote in full here. Suffice to say<sup>7</sup> that much evidence is produced in it in support of the charge of apostacy; and the reply of the Methodist Church is unsatisfying in that quotations from the basic creed of Union do not satisfactorily dispose of the matter in view of the expressed opinions of the church through its official organ and its college textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding the inspiration of the Scriptures, it leaves the matter open as to the degree of inspiration of any book or section of the Bible:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We receive the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, given by inspiration of God, as containing the only infallible rule of faith and life, a faithful record of God’s gracious revelations, and as the sure witness to Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other words, you take your personal choice amongst the scriptures, and those which you believe to be inspired are holy; and they, being inspired, are infallible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt the merry controversy will go on. Other choice gems will from time to time appear, charge and countercharge will be made; and the party in power will consolidate its position, get' control of monies and church properties, and again proceed to “lord it over God’s heritage”; and gradually the public will weary of the whole thing and forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Optimistic reports to the contrary<sup>7</sup> notwithstanding, the Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font7"> publishes as a news item the increasing of Canada’s net debt by some two score millions of dollars “owing to heavy interest payments”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Items that go down in the country’s books read something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interest due and payable on original debt, Umpteen millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interest payable on second bond issue provided to pay above interest, Umpteen millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interest payable on second issue provided to pay above interest, Umpteen millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Net reduction of original debt, Nil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Net increase of total indebtedness, Umpteen </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Billions</span><span class="font7"> of dollars! !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A merry life, the Ottawa bookkeeper s have. In the meantime, the “peaceful penetration” of American dollars goes on apace; and we witness the piecemeal buying of Canada by American capitalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A startling comment on the mental condition of the Canadian nation was voiced recently by</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. E. M. Hincke, Acting Medical Director of the national Committee for Mental Hygiene. The Committee recently met in' Montreal to bring in reports concerning the conditions found throughout the Dominion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Mental diseases are on the increase throughout Canada, and are a greater cause of national inefficiency than is physical disability. Thus it becomes necessary to deal not only with those who are now suffering from mental troubles, but also to inaugurate a national plan of prevention. There are more than 20,000 insane patients in the mental hospitals of the Dominion with an equal number not in confinement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is well known that one of the great causes of insanity is social disease, and recent investigations in the leading Canadian cities have shown that many plague spots exist where such diseases are rampant: Montreal, at present under fire, with an investigation of the police department which produces multiplied evidences of the running, of hundreds of brothels and gambling dens; Toronto with its well known “Ward” conditions, with streets of bootleggers’ joints and other typical “redlight” district appurtenances; Winnipeg, with its scattered, though none the less corrupt, vice conditions; Vancouver, from which emanates the statement according to the Vancouver </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font7"> that there are in the neighborhood of 10,000 cases of venereal disease in Greater Vancouver—2.5 percent of the population afflicted and spreading it rapidly to as many more—all these are signposts pointing toward the need of more asylums and sanitariums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently in The Golden Age appeared an interesting article on “Boys”. The writer seemed to have sympathy with the kids and their playful habits; but he should come to Canada, the land of the free (?). According to a speaker at the recent Convention of the Social Service Council of Canada in Toronto, there are 95,000 laws forbidding the boy to do various and sundry things. And yet he seems to do plenty anyway. The speaker pleaded for a constructive program to use up the boy’s spare time. Apparently there are a few gleams of freedom that the uplifters have not been able to legislate away yet; so they are going after them en bloc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another optimistic statement by F.W. Cowan, Director of the Narcotic division of the Dominion Department of Health, was that there could not possibly be more than 10,000 drug addicts in Canada. He evidently has never visited Montreal, which alone can produce, if the recent</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">investigation can be believed, that many and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kingston, Ontario, the home of the Provincial Penitentiary, is becoming flooded with aristocratic visitors, who are taking up winter (and summer) quarters for longer or shorter periods. Recently a number of the elite, the bon vivants, the shining lights of the socially elect of Toronto, Hamilton, and other centers, have been requested to board there at the expense of a paternal government. JEmilius Jarvis, head of a highly respected Bond house in Toronto; Peter Smith, former Provincial Treasurer; Clarence Settell, secretary to Sir Adam Beck the “Hydro Knight” and Monarch of the Niagara Waters; Charles Matthews, who was mixed up in the Smith-Jarvis bond scandal; the heads of the defunct Home Bank—these are all there or getting ready to go. At a recent stormy meeting of the “diehard” Presbyterian Church group who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'will not</span><span class="font7"> unite with their “Methody” brethren, a prominent minister stated that it might be necessary to send a few ministers of the opposing element to Kingston, too—a threat which at least hints of inside information, which may soon come out and produce the threatened shakeup in ecclesiastical circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bank mergers proceed apace. Two years ago there were eighteen chartered banks in Canada. Today there are twelve. The Molsons has succumbed to the blandishments of the Bank of Montreal, and “gone in”. Thus disappears a name which has been known for seventy years. But your correspondent prophesieth more of the same. Shall we guess at a coalition of the Toronto and the Imperial ? Such is the whisper in our local Wall Street, But there is also a possibility of our banks being reduced to eight only in the near-future. Time will tell, and one story it will tell will have to do with the Union Bank of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Already four banks control seventy-two percent of the country’s savings, and the eight others are hard put to it to make a meal off the balance. Some will soon quit trying. This concentration of Canada’s liquid assets in the hands of a small financial group can result only in a money autocracy which will still further increase the financial stringency now in evidence. As usual the poor man will suffer, and pay dearly for the privilege of living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Carlos Enrique Oriento</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes. The thinking reader recalls the immense values of the gold and diamond mines of Africa, its many varied and enormous natural resources of other kinds, and the vast fertile lands of the Nile and its tributaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is said that the cotton lands now being developed in Sudan, where no artificial fertilizers are required, will produce all the cotton required by British spinners. This, quite naturally, affects our own Southern growers; for they depend to a large extent on the English market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But our cotton growers may take heart; for in sixty-six years they will get their money back, and will have in the meantime collected the three percent interest! Incidentally, it may be interesting to note that by agreement with the late Egyptian Government the British had agreed upon irrigating only 300,000 feddans (approximately 300,000 acres) of land in the Gezira territory; but of the seven demands made by the British Government in retaliation for the murder of the Sirdar, Sir Lee Stack, the sixth demand was that the Sudan Government increase the area to be irrigated to an unlimited figure. However, at the time of this writing, all the requirements have been met, excepting the sixth and the seventh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While discussing this money loaned Britain by this Government, it might be well to state that not all the money was used by Britain in the development of the Sudan territory. A large part of it was used, it is said, in the development of the British Mesopotamian wheat fields. It is said of this natural wheat land, that like the Sudan area it requires no artificial fertilizer; that in the time of the Babylonian and Assyrian Empires, these fields fed the entire Eastern world, and that the yield in this natural home of wheat is three times that of our most productive Western states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no need, however for the Western farmer to here give a groan; for like his Southern brother, he may remember that, according to agreement, in sixty-six years he will have his money back. Besides, he will have three percent interest! This may be long after Mr. Morgan gets his, but that is only proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now let the reader consider all this dissatisfaction in the East—Russia, Japan, China, India, Egypt, etc.—which began in the north country, Russia—from another standpoint. Mr.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HERE was a saying among the Romany Gypsies, when they were bent upon one of their plundering escapades, that they must be about “Egyptian affairs”. Great Britain, developing vast cotton lands in Sudan, wheat fields in Mesopotamia, with three percent money kindly loaned by the people (!) of the United States, besides keeping a weather eye on the Suez Canal, can brook no interference from little Egypt. Nor even if little Egypt did seriously consider League of Nations talk about “self-determination”! No! Britain must be about Egyptian affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only will Britain not brook interference from little Egypt, but she will not brook any prying into her affairs by the foolish League of Nations—or, if you prefer, Plague of Notions. It is claimed by Britain that the Lans-down-Delcasse agreement, a British-French agreement made in 1904, gives Britain a free hand in Egypt; and she has consequently told the League to keep hands off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning the consequences of the recent assassination of the British Sirdar at Cairo a French writer states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What has happened in Egypt this week is vastly more important than is generally realized yet. The murder and its consequences have been discussed thus far from a European political viewpoint, but it is really a tremendous world problem that is now opening up with the nineteenth century colonial empires at grips with Moscow and Angora. ... It is the first great battle between the old bourgeoise European regime and the new dictatorship of the proletariat. How small are our petty national and international problems in comparison !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some writers would have us believe that Britain’s motives for going into Africa, India, etc., are purely philanthropic, much as were those of the United States in going into the Philippines. Possibly it is true that British entry into the affairs of these countries meant much to their peoples in the way of education and general stability, but no unbiased reader will think for a moment that it was entirely without selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only that, but many are beginning now to recognize a fact that has been plain to a few people for many years; i. e., that there has been no stability anywhere since 1914; and that there the old selfish idea of aggression began the march to the last great battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FrankH. Simonds, in an article for the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, says in commenting on the improvement in the material conditions of these subject people of Britain in Egypt:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yet, along with this unmistakable amelioration of the material condition of the various peoples, there has gone another phenomenon, which has ominous significance for the future. The peoples whose material condition has been benefited by foreign rule have in almost all cases begun also to enjoy a degree of education and with this has come the steadily mounting desire and demand for complete independence. ... As for Egypt, after a very very brief period of actual protectorate following upon the outbreak of the World War, there has been an even more rapid revolution. ... So far from being grateful to their masters for the benefits bestowed, real benefits which cannot be gainsaid, the new generations which are coming on, with no personal knowledge of the fashion in which their ancestors misgoverned, look upon present alien administrators with all the passion which the Italians felt for the Austrians in Milan and Venice two generations ago. And their answer to the foreigner is also the knife and the bomb, since they ean not yet raise armies and make war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In concluding the article Mr. Simonds states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Thus from every aspect it is hard to escape the Conclusion that what is happening in Egypt is happening in many places in Europe and in Africa, and may be the first stages in a new world drama, the very limits of which can not now be fixed, but the supreme significance of which can no more be safely ignored.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As already stated, if we admit that the entry of so-called civilized nations into such countries as India, Egypt, the Philippines, etc., has had a beneficent effect in a way, we are also forced to acknowledge that the motive was not free from selfishness. It was, in fact, the predominating motive, a perfectly natural result of the survival of the fittest as practised by all imperialist countries. The United Kingdom embraces an area of approximately 121,000 square miles, with a population of upwards of 60,000,000 people. The people must have cotton for clothing and wheat for food; and the British Isles can not produce them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But in carrying education into Egypt Britain failed to consider the fact that “the increase of knowledge” spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, would be the .very thing which would result in “a time of trouble, . . . such as never was.” Our Lord added: “No, nor ever shall be.” More important still, Jehovah is a great economist. He uses nations and peoples in carrying out His great purposes when those nations and peoples least suspect it. The reader will recall that the Scriptural promises as regards earthly affairs are “to the Jew first, also to the Gentile.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are now entering into the grand jubilee year, and may soon expect the beginning of the fulfilment of the jubilee arrangement as pictured in Leviticus 25:8-11 and as mentioned in Acts 3:19-21. An unerring chronology has established this, and the physical and circumstantial evidences of each twenty-four hours are not to be gainsaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If this is true then, as many of us believe, one of the first things shortly to come to pass is the resurrection of the dead, beginning with the Jews. Then, when we consider the fact, up to about 2000 years ago nearly all the Jewish family that had gone into their graves, were buried in the countries adjacent to both Egypt and Mesopotamia, and largely in these very countries. In the resurrection they will require cotton for clothing and wheat for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So we see how the Great Economist carries out His wise plans even in the face of seeming contradictions; and we see why, after all, the Southern cotton-grower and the Western wheatgrower have little to worry over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And bye and bye the imperialist governments of earth will see how, under a desirable government, earth’s new cooperative arrangements. will both clothe and feed all its peoples; though they will not see this from the position they now occupy upon the necks of these peoples, but from their position among them on the plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may not be strictly to their liking; for &quot;no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as he imbibes gradually the new, and the old is discharged from his system, as his brain clears and returns to normal, as the stupor passes away, he will feel his nerves tingle with an unknown exhilaration, and he will never tire thanking the Great Economist for salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.”-—Jeremiah 51: 64.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>The World’s Deliverer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 273 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7"> DELIVERER is one who rescues another from a perilous position or condition. The world’s deliverer must rescue mankind from the deplorable condition it is now in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The -word “world”, as used here, means the people who reside on the earth. That the nations and peoples of the earth are in a perilous position and in a miserable condition hardly needs proof. That the world needs a deliverer every one must concede.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seven nations of earth are ruled by dictators in name, and many other nations are ruled by dictators in fact. The profiteers and greedy oppressors lay heavy burdens on the people. The laboring class deals unjustly with the financiers. Selfishness predominates among all classes, and every people and every country is against its neighbors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Worse than this is the individual suffering of mankind. The insane asylums are full, and there are many more people outside of these institutions who, are proper subjects for the insane asylum. Scientists have ventured the opinion that within fifty years all the people will be insane if insanity increases in its present proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Crime is on the increase in every land. Lads not out of their short pants organize gangs and burglarize and pillage the homes of many. The major portion of the daily press is filled with details of crimes of every nature. The court calendars are overcrowded with divers cases of numerous crimes and domestic troubles. There is great wickedness in high places, and multiplied crimes amongst those of the lower walks of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hospitals are filled with the sick and the afflicted, while millions of others suffer for want of proper medical care and attention. The war destroyed the best men of Europe and many like ones of America, and left other millions to drag Out a miserable existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While there is increase of material wealth, there is a great dearth of contentment and happiness. The whole creation groans and travails in pain, desiring to be delivered into a better condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nobler-minded of the land have organized lodges and leagues and various other companies for the purpose of alleviating the bad conditions ; but these have accomplished little. Statesmen of the world have diligently sought to bring forth desired reforms that would prove a blessing to the people; but these have failed. The wisdom of this world has been unable to assign a real cause for the difficulty, and has not even suggested an adequate remedy. Surely there must be a primary cause. Shall we abandon hope of some means for deliverance of mankind from its present deplorable condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I answer: No. Man’s extremity is God’s opportunity. The great Jehovah God foreknew that the world would reach its present state of suffering and woe; and in the exercise of His loving-kindness He provided that in due time the world should not only know the cause of the difficulty, but likewise know of a complete remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I shall not attempt to tell the people how to run this world. It has reached an excessive point in crime. There is no human power that can reform it. I have no remedy of my own to offer, nor has any other man. But I do appeal to the people to listen to the Word of God, which speaks with absolute authority disclosing the cause of the trouble and making known the perfect and complete remedy; and that Word reveals the great Deliverer of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible is the Word of God given to man for his instruction in righteousness. (2 Timothy 3:16) The Scriptures are not of private interpretation, but were written by holy men of God, who spake as they were moved upon so to do by the holy spirit. (2 Peter 1: 20, 21) We may then confidently expect that the great Jehovah God has caused to be recorded in His Word that which is requisite to instruct fully the man who diligently seeks to know how he may obtain relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Israel, domiciled in Egypt, were organized by Jehovah into a nation, and that for a purpose. After detailing the various experiences coming to that people the inspired writer in God’s Word says concerning them and their experiences: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”—1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples of earth have come to the end of the world. The due time is here for the people to understand many of the great truths recorded in the Bible which could not be heretofore understood. We will examine with much profit some of Israel's history that foreshadowed better things for the human race in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses was the greatest man who participated in the affairs of Israel. What transpired with reference to him is of keen interest to every student of the Word of God, particularly at this time. Moses in due time became the great deliverer of the people of Israel from the oppression and suffering in Egypt. Moses was a type of the world’s great Deliverer, who will in due time deliver all mankind from the oppression and trouble now afflicting the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Israelites were oppressed in Egypt by the wicked ruler, Pharaoh. Their burdens were grievous to be borne. The miserable condition of the Israelites there pictured the world in its present state of suffering and distress. Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, was a type of Satan, the devil, who the Apostle declares is the “god of this [evil] world”.—2 Corinthians 4: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This picture Jehovah made for the purpose of instructing mankind, and particularly for the benefit of those who at this time are the students of the Word of God. Concerning this, His inspired witness wrote in Romans 15:4 as follows: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures mighl have hope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses was adopted into the royal family, and was reared in luxury<sup>T</sup>. St. Stephen gives a brief and comprehensive review of the great acts of Moses, which is set forth in the seventh chapter of Acts, from the 20th to the 29th verses: “And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.” (Acts 7: 22) After reaching his legal majority, he visited his kinsfolk. He saw their great suffering and how they were oppressed. He would have delivered them then; but they understood him not, and thrust him out. Thus did Moses picture Christ Jesus at His first advent, of whom it is written: “He camel unto his own, and his own received him not.”—John 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses went to a strange land, where he spent a long period of time, thus picturing the dispensation of time between the first and second advents of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next we see Moses in the desert. lie observed a fire in a bush; and seeing that the bush was not being destroyed by the fire he turned aside to observe this strange phenomenon, when the Lord called unto him and said: “I have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.”— Exodus 3: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God sent Moses, then, to Israel to deliver them out of Egypt from the oppression of Pharaoh. This pictures the second coming of our Lord. The promise there not only was to Israel, but foreshado-wed the deliverance that will come to all the world of mankind. When Moses first came to Egypt on this occasion, the deliverance did not follow immediately. Instead of the people’s burdens becoming lighter, their burdens became greater and the suffering increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great antitypical Moses, Christ Jesus, has been present now for some years preparing to deliver the world; and since His second presence, the devil, foreshadowed by Pharaoh, has increased the burdens of the people, and their sufferings have been far greater than before. This is particularly true during the past ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the course of time Moses successfully led the children of Israel out of Egypt. They were delivered in a miraculous manner by the hand of the Lord, and great joy followed. This fore-shado-ws the deliverance of the world; and when it takes place, and the people realize it, the earth will be filled with the praise of the Lord. In the course of time, and that in the near future, Jehovah through the antitypical Moses, Christ Jesus the Lord, -will deliver the peoples of the world from suffering and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But how do I know that Moses represented or typified Christ Jesus'? An answer is found to this in the Scriptures. After God had used Moses to give unto the people of Israel a perfect code of laws; and after organizing them into a nation, acting as their prophet, as their priest and their ruler, Moses then as God’s representative said to the people: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.”—Dent. 18:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Further speaking to Israel, this message from Jehovah was delivered to them: “I ■will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee [Moses], and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.”—Deuteronomy 18:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That we may identify the great Prophet and Leader here meant, the following scriptures are submitted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ was born a Jew, born under the Law. His parents were Jews or Israelites. (Matthew 1:1-17) Jesus said: “For had ye Relieved Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.” ( John 5: 46) That He was sent to be the Savior of the world and the Deliverer, we read: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.”—Luke 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Pentecost, when the apostles had received the holy spirit and spoke with authority from the Lord, St. Peter stood up and said: “But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you.”;—Acts 3:18,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Moses was the greatest man of Israel’s history, Christ Jesus was far greater than Moses; for Moses was a type of Christ Jesus. While the work of Moses was important, it is small in comparison with the work and the importance of the work done by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Cause of Suffering</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HY are there so much sickness, suffering, crime and trouble in the world! It can be truly answered that all kinds of wickedness, profiteering, oppression, war, troubles, sickness, sorrow and death are traceable directly to the effects of sin. He who is and has long been the very embodiment of sin and wickedness is Satan the devil. He it is that is called the prince of this world. (John 14: 30) He is also called the god of this world. (2 Cor. 4:4) He is the father of lies and a murderer from the beginning. (John 8:44) He it was who seduced mother Eve and caused her to sin, Adam subsequently joining in the transgression. Adam was sentenced to death, and the entire race came under condemnation by reason of his disobedience. The entire race was born in sin and shapen in iniquity. Selfishness has long been predominant. The burdens of the human family have increased and the whole race has had an experience with the baneful effects of sin. God purposes to overrule this experience for the good Of man and thereby to teach him that sin leads to death, but that obedience leads to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God made a promise that He would send a Redeemer of mankind. (Hosea 13:14) In the course of time Jesus came to earth. He came to fulfil the promise to give His life a ransom for mankind. (Matthew 20: 28) “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul referred to Jesus in His mission to the earth, saying, “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,-he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” (Hebrews 2:9,14,15) Again, the apostle Paul testifies that Jesus gave himself as the deliverer: “Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.”—Gal. 1:4.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>When Deliverance Will Come</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250225_files/g_E_19250225-22.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">EEING that the Lord was here nearly 1900 years ago, why has deliverance of the race not taken place sooner? Again I refer to the type made by Moses. Moses first went to the Israelites and offered deliverance; but they thrust </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font7">away. The Lord Jesus came nearly 1900 years ago and offered himself as the King and Deliverer of Israel; but they rejected Him and crucified Him. It was necessary for Him to die in order to provide the redemptive price for mankind. He died and rose from the dead, and thereafter ascended into heaven; and on the day of Jesus’ ascension into heaven the angel of the Lord testified to witnesses standing by that He would come again. (Acts 1:11) Now He has come again. The period of time elapsing between the first and second advents of our Lord has been employed for the preaching of the gospel, that the Lord might select from amongst men a few who should be associates with Christ Jesus in His wonderful work. As is recorded, God at the first did visit the nations to take out of them a people for His name.—Acts 15:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During that period of time the Jews have been cast off. Many so-called Christians have denounced and abused the Jews. Many a preacher has stood in his pulpit, and said all manner of evil things against the Jewish people; and many others have consigned the entire lot of Israel to eternal torture! These have failed to read their Bibles intelligently. The apostle Paul, addressing himself to the Christians after the casting away of Israel, warned them against the evil of becoming self-conceited and high-minded. He said: “For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.“—Romans 11: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here we read then that when the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, the great Deliverer shall come forth from Zion, God’s organization, for the purpose of delivering the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are just at that time now, and there are millions on earth who will witness the complete change of dispensation which is now in progress. The Lord will set up His kingdom of righteousness on earth, and it will bring the desire of all honest hearts.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Who Will be Saved?</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250225_files/g_E_19250225-23.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">INCE the Lord comes as the Deliverer of the world, does this mean a universal salvation of all, and that all people will live forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looking back to the type when Moses delivered the Israelites from Egypt, had any of them refused to follow Moses and obey him they would have remained in Egypt, and doubtless suffered destruction at the hands of the Egyptians. Referring to Moses as a type the Scriptures say: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”— Acts 3: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It •will be first necessary for the people to be brought to a knowledge of the truth and to accept the Lord Jesus as the great Ransomer or Redeemer. (1 Timothy 2:3,4, 6) The Lord’s Word declares that deliverance from death to life is a gift from God. The Apostle says: “For the &quot;wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23) The Apostle says: “There fore, as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”—Romans 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A gift is not effective unless it is accepted by the one to whom it is offered. This means then that all those who refuse to accept the Lord as the great Deliverer and who refuse to obey Him shall not live, but shall be destroyed, just as the Lord foretold through the words of Moses. The great ransom sacrifice is not a guarantee that everybody shall live, whether he wants to or not, but it is a guarantee that every man shall have an opportunity of obeying and living. This will mean that all in their graves shall be awakened and be brought to a knowledge of the fact that the Lord Jesus is the great Deliverer, and that those who obey shall live and shall not die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a great deal of oppression amongst the people now. Satan is the great oppressor; and he has many instrumentalities on the earth that work for him to oppress the weak and the poor. The prophet Isaiah, referring to this, says: “That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!” —Isaiah 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The king of Babylon means the mighty ruling factors of the governments of earth. The marginal reading is, as you will see in the margin of your Bible: “How hath the exactress of gold ceased!” Greed for gain has made the ruling factors of the world great oppressors to mankind. The Lord will deliver mankind from all such, including the chief oppressor, the devil himself. The Lord will judge the people righteously that everyone may stand equal before His law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning this we read: “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.”—Psalm 72:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord shall deliver the people from the oppressive war lords; for it is written that the people will “beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Micah 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He shall deliver the people from the oppressive landlords who make it difficult for the poor to own their own houses and to enjoy the fruits of their labors, as it is written: “But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”—Micah 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He shall deliver the people from sickness, because He will bring them health; for it is written: “I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord.” (Jeremiah 30:17) And again: “I will bring in health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” —Jeremiah 33: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the obedient ones shall have their names written in His book of life. If they obey they shall live, and thus He will deliver them from death; for it is written: “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”— 1 Corinthians 15: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He will take away sorrow and weeping from the earth and fill it with gladness and joy; for it is written: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”—Revelation 21: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the people shall return from the land of the enemy and come with gladness to the Lord; for it is written: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”—Isaiah 35:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Moses had successfully delivered the Israelites from the hands of the Egyptians, and when they were safe beyond the perils of the devil’s .representative at the Red Sea, they formed a great chorus with Moses and his sister Miriam, and they sang songs of praise unto Jehovah God. These were songs of deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the great antitypical Moses shall have delivered the world and restored all the obedient ones and they are safe from the devil and his agencies, then the earth will be filled with a happy, glorious race of people; and all will join together in singing the hallelujah chorus, and everything that hath breath will sing the praises of the great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary : praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.”—Psa. 150.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Tablet</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Catholic] Dec., 6, 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., addressing the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men’s Bible Class of the Park Avenue Baptist Church, Manhattan, on Sunday, sounded a warning against the danger of the complete annihilation of our present-day civilization. “It is clear,” he said, “that civilization, built upon the marvelous discoveries of science, made possible by the most advanced and general system known to men, with all the comforts, luxuries, pleasures and opportunities which it has brought, is headed toward its own annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But why, we ask ourselves, is this so ? The answer is clear: Because the development of mind and matter has so outstripped the development of the spiritual values in human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Materialism has proved to be its own destruction in many of the civilizations of the ' world, which have had their day and been wiped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The products of the mind are less temporary, but they are subject to revision and change. Spiritual values only are enduring, eternal. Upon them alone can a lasting civilization be built. An automobile driven by a lawless man is a menace; driven by a good citizen it is a useful thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Wealth in the hands of the selfish and unscrupulous is a curse, but wealth in the hands of the philanthropic is a blessing. Power possessed by the designing and vicious is fraught with danger, but power possessed by the wise and beneficent is an instrument of good. All these are things to be desired, as are also many of the countless products of modem civilization</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The danger in the present civilization lies in the fact that the creations of man’s brain, his creatures, which should be his servants, are getting beyond his control and are becoming his masters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The development of man’s character or spiritual nature has not kept pace with the development of his intellect and its products. Like the farmer who only wanted to buy the land adjoining his, so the constant gratification of material desires only breeds new desires and increases selfishness. That paradoxical saying of Christ’s that the only way to find one’s life is to lose it, is profoundly true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Men cannot long continue to live together in an ever more closely inter-related and inter-dependent world unless they are guided by the spiritual laws and principles which religion teaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Consideration, unselfishness, self-sacrifice, service, all springing from love for God, love of our brother, these are the spiritual qualities which must keep pace with and dominate intellectual and material progress if civilization itself is to survive. Religion in its essence is the personal relation between God and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Has civilization outgrown religion? Clearly the answer is ‘No’. For civilization can never outgrow religion and survive. It may temporily have outstripped religion, but it can never outgrow religion; for religion in some form or other is basic in the human heart, is a necessity of the human soul. It cannot be outgrown. From the earliest dawn of civilization man has craved the help, solace, strength of a power higher than his own. With some perhaps in times of great danger or overwhelming sorrow or sore need does this craving manifest itself. With others it is ever present, leading to a continual fellowship with God. No; civilization has not outgrown religion, but just outrun it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But religion must quicken its pace if it is to gain that ascendency over civilization, if it is to provide the kind of world leadership which is so sorely needed. And, let me say it with profound conviction and with all the earnestness I possess, nothing else but true religion, God’s spirit working through man, can save our civilization or the civilization of the world.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>SS7</sup>The time of the Lord’s second appearing is of great importance to all; and Christians, since the days of the apostles, have been watching for some evidence of His presence and asking the question, When will the Lord appear? While those who love the Lord discuss the important question, some have answered, saying, ‘The Lord is liable to come any moment. He may come tonight.’ These expect the Lord’s appearing in a visible body. Others, who have no real desire for His coming, because it would interfere with their selfish plans, say: ‘He will not come in my time; He will not come for fifty thousand years or more. Hence there is no reason for our concerning ourselves about His coming.’ Still others who fear His coming and who do not desire to see Him say: ‘No one can possibly know the time. Why, therefore, should one spend his time in discussing the question?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>388</sup>The last-named class, in support of their contention, cite, the words of Jesus when He said: “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” (Matthew 24:36) It is assumed because He used these words that no one would ever know except Jehovah. We should remember that Jesus spoke these words while He was yet a man on the earth. He had not been glorified then. He did not say that no one would ever know of the hour or the day of His coming. If we conclude from these words that no man would ever know, we might as well conclude that Jesus would never know; for He said at that time that only the Father knew. Paraphrasing His words we note that He said this: ‘The day of my coming no one now knows except my Father. Neither man nor angel At the same time, His words implied that conditions would change, so that others would know; for He said: “Watch therefore: for ye know not the hour your Lord doth come.” (Matthew 24:42) Why watch unless they would knows anything about it; nor do I even know.’ know when the time would arrive? When Jesus arose from the dead He said: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” (Matthew 28:18) He must have known then the time of His second coming; for now as the creature divine everything was committed into His hands for the outworking of God’s plan. At the time of His appearing surely the angels of heaven would know about it; and the day must come when the watchers would know.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">State the various opinions expressed by some concerning the Lord’s second coming, fl 387.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is the time of His coming important to Christians ? Why do some of these desire Him not to come? fl 387. Are we justified in assuming that no one could ever know the time of our Lord’s second appearing? and if not, why not? fl 388.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it reasonable to suppose that Jesus himself would know some time before? fl 388.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why would He tell His disciples to watch if they would never know of His coming? 388.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus arose from the dead, what did He say about the power committed to Him? fl 388.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it reasonable to conclude that He then knew of His second appearing and when it would take place? Should we expect the angels in heaven to know when that great event takes place ? fl 388.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Strife in the Churches</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Torn by a controversial spirit and rent with disputation, the churches meet the problems of 1925 with the uncertainty that there is in mutiny in the ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Repeated failure of the plans of the world leaders has bred an uneasiness that looks for some word of the end to which affairs relentlessly move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Word that holds the assurance of intervention by a power beyond man’s, an assurance that would hold forth the essence for hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But are leaders of spiritual thought, one faction disbelieving—the -other untenable—are such capable of inspiring man with hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible meets the present crisis with that stellar force so peculiar to forces not bound, not limited, but characteristic of control that is better to be talked over and contemplated than to be tersely analyzed within the bounds of exact prediction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible’s solution of the present-day problems evolves a plan for man’s happiness, a plan that begets confidence; because the world's present trouble is identified by the fulfilled prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Harp Bible Study Course uses as its basis the prophecies of the Bible, assembling the writings in the order of their bearing upon the history of the world, and assembling the teachings under ten basic doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Harp Bible Study Course seeks to identify those prophecies that interpret today’s events, that would lend assurance in what seems to be so impenetrable. * The course outlines reading periods of an hour each week, completing the course in twelve weeks’ time. Self-quiz cards point out the principal things to watch for as you read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a reference library for examination of particular texts, the seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures complete a library of over 4,000 pages, bound in maroon cloth gold stamped. All texts are indexed, and the subjects are arranged topically. &gt;</span></p>

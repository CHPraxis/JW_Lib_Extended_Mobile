<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Keeping separate essential for friends of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) We need his friendship to strengthen and comfort us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3, 4</a>) We need help from our Father, Jehovah, for forgiveness of sin.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Jesus set the example in separateness from the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:14</a>) He refused to accept political authority, advised against resorting to force or fighting. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Such separateness includes neutrality on political and social issues, not becoming meddlers in affairs of others.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:15-60:4:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Our separateness also means not following ways of world, but upholding purity in all our conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:14-60:1:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:14, 15</a>) A person who is envious or unloving, who engages in obscene talk or favors entertainment that features works of flesh may lose God’s friendship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eph. 5:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:20" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:20</a>) Just as Jesus did not center his life on material things, neither should those who are separate from this system. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:8</a>) Separateness also shown by Christian subjection to those having authority, whether one is employee, wife or child, at home or in school.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Separateness from world brings rich blessings. It results in a clean conscience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:19-60:2:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:19, 20</a>) Jehovah’s friends are known as his witnesses and they enjoy prospect of everlasting life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 15:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p>

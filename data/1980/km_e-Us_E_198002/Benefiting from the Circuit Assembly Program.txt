Benefiting from the Circuit Assembly Program
1 How good Jehovah is to us in feeding us spiritual food as we need it! The circuit assembly program is one fine example of this. Have not all of us been more determined to fill our lives with righteous fruitage as a result of the Scriptural admonition and stirring experiences of our brothers that we heard at the last assembly? The program reminded us, too, of the great value that comes to us by submitting to the cultivator’s discipline. Surely our lives have been enriched and we have gained greater spiritual strength.
2 Starting in February, the program will emphasize the need for us to walk ‘as obedient children and become holy in all our conduct.’ (1 Pet. 1:14-16) It will show the benefits we receive from supporting the congregation book study arrangement, the blessings that come to families that obediently serve Jehovah and keep his commands, as well as the importance of developing a willingness to obey. We can learn much from the example Jesus set in being obedient and the disposition he showed.
3 Start thinking about the assembly now and plan to attend. Think, too, of others in the congregation or interested persons who may need encouragement to attend. We are confident you will benefit greatly from the spiritual meal that awaits you.

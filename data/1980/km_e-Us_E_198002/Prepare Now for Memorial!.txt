Prepare Now for Memorial!
1 Wasn’t it wonderful to have 1,335,268 in this country in attendance at the Memorial celebration last year! Surely those who were there for the first time came to appreciate even more deeply the significance of the occasion and the value of Christ’s ransom. On Monday, March 31, we will again be observing the Lord’s Evening Meal.
2 Each publisher in the congregation should begin thinking now about those whom he will want to invite to the Memorial celebration. These would include not only persons having home Bible studies, but also other interested persons who still have a respect for God’s Word, even though Bible studies with them were discontinued.
3 There were about 806,000 more in attendance at the last Memorial celebration than reported as publishers for that month. So, we will be expecting many visitors to join us again this year. There is also much we can do to follow through in helping Memorial attenders to come to other meetings at the Kingdom Hall. For example, the special public talk will be held on Sunday, April 6. The title of the public talk is a timely one, “Coping with Life’s Anxieties.” Publishers can do much to build up interest for this subject by pointing out how the talk will provide Bible answers not only to the causes for life’s anxieties, but how to effectively cope with them.
4 Elders and ministerial servants will be interested in meeting many of the individuals that publishers invite to the Memorial. In the March issue of Our Kingdom Service further information will be provided as to steps that can be taken to help these people.
5 Begin thinking about those you are now calling on in the field service—any who used to study or who showed interest in the past, as well as friends, neighbors and relatives. Have in mind persons you will want to invite to the Memorial and also help thereafter.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you had the privilege of serving as an auxiliary pioneer? Many blessings have come to those who have. One sister expressed it this way: “I am indeed thankful for the rich blessings, spiritual strength and beautiful experiences I have had while auxiliary pioneering.” Another said: “So many wonderful things have happened since I started auxiliary pioneering. I now have two very good Bible studies!” Perhaps you have experienced similar happiness.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Just imagine to what a great extent the good news was preached, how much honor went to Jehovah and what encouragement it was to all the brothers when 51,008 auxiliary pioneered in this country last April. Many are looking ahead to warmer weather when they will again be arranging their schedules to auxiliary pioneer. Can you join them? Why not start making plans now to enroll!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>What are the requirements for enrollment? You must be baptized, have a reputation for good Christian conduct and have made plans to devote at least 60 hours in the field service for the month.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Those of you who can make room for this special privilege of service truly have many blessings in store for you as you apply yourselves to serve Jehovah and your fellowman in a whole-souled way!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>.</p>

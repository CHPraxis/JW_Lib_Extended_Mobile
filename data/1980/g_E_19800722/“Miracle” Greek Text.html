<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When reviewing “The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures” for “The Classical Journal,” Thomas N. Winter of the University of Nebraska observed:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“An original Greek text for two dollars is something of a miracle, and it should not surprise us that it took a world-wide group of Bible students to pull it off. This is no ordinary interlinear: the integrity of the text is preserved, and the English which appears below it is simply the basic meaning of the Greek word. . . . A translation in smooth English appears in a slim column at the right-hand margin of the pages. . . . I think it is a legitimate and highly useful aid toward the mastery of koine (and classical) Greek. After examining a copy, I equipped several interested second-year Greek students with it as an auxiliary text. . . . After learning the proper pronunciations, a motivated student could probably learn koine Greek from this source alone.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The text is based on that of Brooke F. Westcott and Fenton J. A. Hort (1881, repr.), but the translation by the anonymous committee is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate. Where both the <strong>King James </strong>and the <strong>Revised Standard, </strong>for instance, have ‘wise men’ for the Greek <strong>magoi </strong>(e.g., <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:1-40:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:7-40:2:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:16-40:2:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2:16</a>), the <strong>Kingdom Interlinear </strong>has ‘astrologers,’ a more correct and informative rendition. The book has been very carefully compiled and printed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“In sum, when a Witness comes to the door, the classicist, Greek student, or Bible student alike would do well to bring him in and place an order.”​—April-May, 1974, pp. 375-376.</p>

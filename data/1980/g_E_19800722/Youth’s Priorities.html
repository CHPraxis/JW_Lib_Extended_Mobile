<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Advanced journalism students at Gross Pointe South High School in Michigan conducted a survey that may shed some light on what many modern youths put first in their lives. The survey revealed that an average student at the high school spent about $4,400 annually, using almost twice as much for cigarettes, alcohol and drugs as for lunches and clothing. In a month the average student was said to spend: Alcohol and drugs, $80.84; cigarettes, $37.60; clothing, $46.29; lunches, $21.12; automobile expenses, $24.11. What will be the next generation’s priorities?</p>

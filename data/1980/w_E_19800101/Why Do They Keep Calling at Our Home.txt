Why Do They Keep Calling at Our Home?
HAVE you ever wondered why Jehovah’s Witnesses call at your door? They do so because they are looking for persons desiring to learn more about God’s Word, the Bible. Also, they have taken to heart these words of Jesus, spoken to his followers: “You will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) In this way they are showing love toward their neighbor.​—Matt. 22:39.
Some Bible students soon realize that they should be telling others the good news of God’s kingdom. For instance, Witnesses in Guadeloupe had been studying the Bible with a young married couple for only two weeks when these individuals attended a recent Christian convention. On learning that house-to-house witnessing was scheduled for one of the assembly days, this couple desired to participate. Why?
“It is not to see how things are going along in the preaching work,” they said, “ . . . but it is because we have understood from our study so far, and from what we have heard today on the program, that we ourselves must preach.” God’s Word had stimulated in them this desire, and they did have a share in that special witnessing activity.
But what is the content of the “good news”? Why is it so good? What is there about it that moves many to share it enthusiastically with others? Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses the next time they call at your home?

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The total of 565,309 publishers for August is a peak for the past service year. What a fine way in which to close out the 1980 service year! In fact, August saw the highest number of publishers reporting since November 1975 when there was an all-time peak of 577,362 in the field. We are all greatly encouraged by this evidence of Jehovah’s blessing to keep pressing forward in making known the Kingdom good news and sounding the divine warning.</p>

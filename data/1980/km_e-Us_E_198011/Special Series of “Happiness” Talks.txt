Special Series of “Happiness” Talks
1 How delighted we are to have the new book, Happiness—How to Find It. Many quickly read through this new publication shortly after receiving it, but in order for all to get a firm grasp on this excellent information about true happiness and how to find it, a series of eight talks will be presented during January and February, 1981. The titles for these talks are set out below.
1—“Where to Look for Happiness” (Chap. 1-3)
2—“Help in Coping with Life’s Problems” (Chap. 4-6)
3—“How to Find Success in Family Life” (Chap. 7, 8)
4—“A Healthier, Happier Life—How?” (Chap. 9, 10)
5—“You Can Overcome Sickness and Death” (Chap. 11-13)
6—“What Reason to Hope for a Better Future?” (Chap. 14, 15)
7—“A Christian View of Government and Law” (Chap. 16, 17)
8—“Will You Worship God in HIS Way?” (Chap. 18-20)
2 Similar to last year’s arrangements, there will be no outlines provided for these talks. This is the only notice that congregations will receive on this matter. Each congregation should immediately make definite arrangements for this series to be presented. Qualified speakers should be assigned talks and in some cases capable ministerial servants may be used if needed. Since some congregations may have a limited number of capable speakers, neighboring congregations may wish to stagger the starting date of the series of talks, one beginning January 4 and the other on January 11. Thus, even with a limited number of qualified speakers, the same brother could give the same talk in each congregation and the sequence would be maintained in the order as listed above.

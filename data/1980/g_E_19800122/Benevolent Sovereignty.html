<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Bible states an obvious truth when it says: “Man has dominated man to his injury.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:9</a>) In contrast, Jehovah’s sovereignty through his Messiah is poetically described in this way: “He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:6-19:72:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 72:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Under that sovereignty men will not dominate or injure their fellowman. Neighbor love will be the guideline. It should be now. In these two examples God ordains it: in marriage and in the Christian congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In a marriage the man is to be the head, but not in a domineering way. He is told to love his wife as he does himself. Even more than this, he is to love her as Christ loved his congregation​—and he died for it! Husbands must remember this.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the congregation the divine arrangement is for elders to have oversight, but never to domineer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:11-49:4:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 11-16</a>) Jesus said: “Do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 23:8, 9</a>) Elders must remember this.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yes, man <em>should not </em>dominate others to their injury. Under Jehovah’s sovereignty, when only God’s heavenly government rules all the earth, man <em>will not be allowed </em>to do so!</p>

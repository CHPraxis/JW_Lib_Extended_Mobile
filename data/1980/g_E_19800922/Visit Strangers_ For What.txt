Visit Strangers? For What?
“The Observer” magazine of Canada’s United Church titled an article: “Who, Me? Visit Strangers?” It suggests that both ministers and laity can make such calls, but “suppose that stranger does open the door and invites you in. Then what? What do you say?” The article cautions against discussing money: “One of the images the church needs to wipe out is that we only visit with an outstretched hand​—palm uppermost.”
Among things recommended for discussion were: “the church bulletin if it has phone numbers and meeting dates on it. The newsletter. The annual report, if it’s interesting, and shows what your church is all about.” Jesus’ recommendation to his disciples when he sent them out “ringing” their equivalent of “doorbells” might have been helpful to United Church visitors: “Go therefore and make disciples of people . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”​—Matt. 28:19, 20.

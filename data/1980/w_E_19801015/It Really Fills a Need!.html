<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>MY BOOK OF BIBLE STORIES</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most parents want their children to not only read but to enjoy it, because they realize that reading is the key to knowledge. Many, too, want their children to know something of the Bible, and of God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This book is published to fulfill these aims. Written in clear, concise English, it will be easily understood by the young reader. However, Dads and Moms will not be bored reading it to the pre-reader. Each story is short, and designed to increase communication between parent and child. There are also beautiful illustrations to pictorially express the Bible Story.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For the more serious Bible student, there are references to the Bible itself, at the end of each story, so that these can be read if desired. As the stories are presented in chronological order, many have found this book helpful to relate the events of the Bible, not only to other parts of the Bible, but also to other happenings in history.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Throughout the book, a good moral standing and a good relationship with God is encouraged.</p>

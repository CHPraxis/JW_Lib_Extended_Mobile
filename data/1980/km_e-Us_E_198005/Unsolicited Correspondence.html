<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some brothers and sisters are receiving letters from individuals in other countries whom they do not personally know. Many of these people claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, but often they have been found to be impostors, seeking to take advantage of the brothers for personal gain. Such correspondence may ask for material or financial aid, as well as Bibles and literature of the Society. It would be advisable for anyone receiving such correspondence to forward it to the Society’s office in Brooklyn, and it will be either handled or forwarded to the appropriate branch for attention.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is always good to be alert to the activities of impostors, whether they be in our own country or elsewhere. Your cooperation in this regard will be very much appreciated.</p>

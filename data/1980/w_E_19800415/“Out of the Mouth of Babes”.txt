“Out of the Mouth of Babes”
Who is Jehovah?
Then who is Jesus?
What do Jehovah’s Witnesses believe?
ON ONE occasion during Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry, boys hailed him as “the Son of David.” This greatly displeased the Jewish chief priests and scribes. In response to his indignant opposers, Jesus asked: “Did you never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise’?” (Matt. 21:15, 16; Ps. 8:2) To this day, many youngsters are praising Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. Often they do so by giving a Scriptural witness at school.
IN THE Netherlands, eight-year-old Marina was invited to give an informal talk in the classroom. The teacher granted her permission to speak about Jehovah. Desiring to get all the children involved, Marina wrote some questions for the class on the blackboard. Among these were such queries as “Who is Jehovah?” “Then who is Jesus?” and “What do Jehovah’s Witnesses believe?” Marina and Ritchie, the son of another Witness, answered the questions posed by their fellow students.
MARINA arrived home that day virtually bubbling over with enthusiasm. Also, after school she and Ritchie visited all the parents of their classmates, and in this way they placed 21 copies of the book “Listening to the Great Teacher,” a Bible study aid especially designed for parents to read with their young children. In fact, this book had helped these praisers of Jehovah themselves to learn much about God’s Word and his purposes.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Getting the Most from Our Bible Reading. (To be handled by school overseer.) Family group on stage discusses their study needs. All agree that they have been negligent about weekly Bible reading assignment. Different family members volunteer variety of excuses. The father acknowledges that all have busy schedules and need to be determined to stick with a practical weekly schedule. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Second Timothy 3:16, 17</a> is read and the question is asked: How important is it for us to read the Bible? All agree that it has many far-reaching benefits and is well worth the time. How can we include it in our schedule? A portion could be read at mealtimes. Eliminating just one half-hour TV program a week might be enough. Any other suggestions by the family are discussed. (Chairman interrupts to discuss with the audience suggestions they may have. Then asks audience how they have benefited from regular reading of the Bible. Comments from the audience could include new things learned, such as greater appreciation for Bible truths, more insight into the meaning by understanding the context, better clarification of Bible principles and their application, and so forth.) Family expresses their determination to keep up with the Bible reading, not just out of a sense of duty, but because it is enjoyable and rewarding. It serves for their spiritual upbuilding.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:1-44:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 4:1-4</a>) We too are encouraged by their service reports. Our reports likewise bring praise.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The literature offer for September will feature a new “Kingdom News” tract along with a book. In past campaigns the Society has printed and shipped tracts at no charge to the congregations. However, due to drastic increases in paper and shipping costs, and the expense of obtaining new printing equipment, it is not possible for us to subsidize the tract distribution this year. Therefore, the congregations are being asked to contribute $3.60 per 1200 tracts. Please determine your needs and order in lots of 1200 using the S-14 Literature Order Blank. Your order should be in Brooklyn by June 6, 1980.</p>

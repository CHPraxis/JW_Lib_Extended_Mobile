● All regular and special pioneers on the list for six months at the time of the district convention may receive $14.00 worth of convention tickets and any free releases by showing their Pioneer Identification and Assignment card to a designated cashier and the bookroom respectively. Those in circuit, district and Bethel service have received a 1980 Convention Identification card for this purpose.
● Congregations will schedule a 30-minute review of things learned at the district convention.

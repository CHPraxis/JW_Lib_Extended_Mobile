● Starting in September the circuit overseers will be giving a slide presentation entitled: “What Bible Lands Tell Us.” District overseers will be speaking on the topic: “Our Refuge Amid Increasing Dangers.”
● We have been asked by a number of congregations how to obtain the Federal Identification Number now required. This can be done by obtaining an SS-4 form from the Internal Revenue Service office, filling it out according to the facts and mailing it to the local Internal Revenue Center. The address can be obtained when you obtain the form. Your number will thereafter be mailed to you by the Internal Revenue Center.
● So that congregations can make suitable arrangements for the Memorial celebration next year, the date will be Sunday, April 19, 1981, after sundown.
● Pioneers and secretaries will note a change in the S-200 Regular Pioneer Report card when they receive their new supply soon. The congregation number should now be shown on the front of the card. The back of the card should be filled out when a pioneer changes name due to change in marital status, and so forth. Notation should also be made on the back of the card when a pioneer moves to a different congregation and needs to be reassigned. Space is still provided for a brief explanation when a pioneer falls short of the 90 hours for the month.
● Out of Stock in U.S.A.:
Aid to Bible Understanding
Orders may again be placed after September 1, 1980.

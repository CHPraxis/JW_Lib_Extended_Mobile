<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">You are warmly invited to be present with us for the yearly commemoration of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus himself instituted a memorial of his death on the night before he died. At that time Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) This denotes a regular, annual observance. Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you to join them in memorializing this important event on March 31, 1980. This corresponds with Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. You and your family are welcome to be present with us to hear an upbuilding Bible talk about the meaning and purpose of this observance and the benefits to be derived from it. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and meeting place.</p>

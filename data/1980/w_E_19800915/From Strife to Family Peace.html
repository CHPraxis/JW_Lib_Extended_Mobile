<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANUEL, his wife and their young son and daughter live in Spain. Today they are a happy family. But it was not always that way.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When they got married, Manuel and his bride did not know each other well. Soon they began to argue and fight. Manuel was a jealous person and a heavy drinker. He often came home drunk and in a fighting mood. Why, eventually things got so bad that they had a battle every three or four days! After some years, Manuel began having an affair with another woman. His wife was so desperate that she considered committing suicide or poisoning him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then a new influence entered their home. Manuel’s wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, but he did not want to know anything about it. However, some months later he was in a nearby room while a study was being conducted with his wife, and he overheard these words: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>) That struck him. At work he had stolen food, understanding from his religion that the poor could steal from the rich. Soon he, too, was studying the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In three months, Manuel put an end to his heavy drinking, his smoking and his immoral relationship. Then the usual family fights also ceased. He was especially touched by the Bible’s counsel that a man was to ‘love his wife as his own body.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 5:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Gradually, Manuel became a much better husband.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This change from strife to peace and happiness in the family was so great that it also affected Manuel’s father. He, too, was moved to study the Bible and apply it in his life. Today, Manuel, his wife and his father are dedicated witnesses of Jehovah God.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD is the “Hearer of prayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>) Fittingly, then, Jehovah’s Witnesses pray for God’s direction and blessing as they declare the “good news” of his kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Yes, prayer is essential in finding persons of honest heart. And often such individuals themselves pray with spiritually rewarding results.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Rio de Janeiro one Sunday morning, some Witnesses were finishing their field service activity, but a few houses remained to be worked. One Christian woman said to the Witness in charge of the group: “I want to continue working a while. For some reason I want to go to that house.” He suggested that they leave the remaining houses for another day of door-to-door witnessing activity. But she insisted.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At that particular house, a young girl answered the door and went to call her mother. After a long time, the mother came to the door with her eyes red from tears. Later, she told the Witness that she had been crying and praying to God for help.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The woman had been contacted previously by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but had not shown interest in the Bible’s message. Then the sudden death of her husband made her want to talk to the Witnesses again. She even went looking for their Kingdom Hall, but in vain.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By using the Holy Scriptures that Sunday morning, the Witness consoled the unhappy woman. A Bible study was started with her, and that same month she began attending Christian meetings. Not long thereafter, the woman was baptized in symbol of her dedication to God. It had all begun with prayer.</p>

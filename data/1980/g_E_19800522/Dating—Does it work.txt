Dating​—Does it work?
This question is discussed in the 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. Other chapters are “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” “Can You Succeed in Marriage?” and “How Do You View Material Possessions?” This book can be a real help to young people to get the most from their youth.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I enclose 50 cents (U.S.).

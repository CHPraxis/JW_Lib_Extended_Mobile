<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">FEMALE OVUM + MALE SPERM = FERTILIZED EGG WHICH DIVIDES AND DIVIDES. . .</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">AND DIVIDES . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">3 <em>weeks. </em>The embryo is one tenth of an inch long, but already has a primitive nervous system with a two-lobed brain. A U-shaped heart pumps blood through a simple system of vessels. Blood is made by the yolk sac.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">AND DIVIDES . . .</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">9 <em>weeks. </em>No longer called an embryo, it is a fetus some 2 inches in length from crown to rump. The liver has taken over the manufacture of red blood cells, but by now the cartilage is turning to bone, which will take over the work of producing blood. All vital organs have been developed, kidneys are functioning. Major muscles have now formed, along with eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Arms and legs are present, also fingers and toes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">AND DIVIDES . . .</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">4 <em>months. </em>Now some 8 to 10 inches long. Movements that started at 3 months now intensify. The baby bends, twists and even turns somersaults​—it’s virtually weightless floating in the fluid of the amniotic sac. Its mother may even be awakened during the night by its vigorous movements. It sucks its thumb, exercising muscles to be used later for feeding at its mother’s breasts. The entire reproductive system has formed. Salivary glands work, peristalsis moves the intestines. Three major regions of the brain​—medulla, cerebellum, cerebrum—​are clearly separate. Fingers and toes curl when palms and soles of feet are tickled.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">AND DIVIDES . . .</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">6 <em>months. </em>Many organs are virtually completely developed. Nostrils are open, hair and eyebrows are growing. The baby can be startled by loud noises and probably hears its mother’s heartbeat. Fissures begin to form on the cortex of the <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>expanding cerebrum. Fingernails and fingerprints appear, and, inexplicably, the baby’s grip is stronger now than it will be at birth. Although weighing less than one pound, with special care it can now survive outside its mother’s womb. One case is known where a premature baby of 5 months survived, and as sophisticated medical equipment and skills increase, the age of viability (ability to live outside the womb) will shorten.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">AND DIVIDES . . .</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">40 <em>weeks. </em>The baby’s ready to leave the womb. The mother’s ready. The elastic walls of the uterus have been stretched to capacity, and now rhythmic contractions make themselves known in the form of labor pains. The uterus is the largest and most powerful muscle of the human body and its contractions put 25 to 30 pounds of pressure on the contents of the womb. The baby is pushed out, travels along the birth canal and enters the outside world. The umbilical cord is cut and closed off, the baby breathes, and the fetal circulation that bypassed the lungs now changes to normal circulation through the lungs for the blood to rid itself of carbon dioxide and take on the life-sustaining oxygen. Baby is on its own!</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>UNLESS </strong>some force intervenes to halt the continuing cell divisions. Today such a force is intervening, a deadly invasion taking place millions of times every year. The Bible likens children to “little plants grown up in their youth” that grace the family circle. But millions of mothers a year now insist that abortionists invade their womb and nip in the bud the “little plants” living there.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:144:12-19:144:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 144:12</a>.</p>

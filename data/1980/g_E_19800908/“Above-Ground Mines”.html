<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Scrap yards were called “above-ground mines” by an official of the Canadian Association of Recycling Industries. He said that using scrap metal saves 90 percent of the materials, 74 percent of the energy and 40 percent of the water normally used to make steel from ore. Enough fuel to run over a million cars was said to be saved annually in Canada.</p>

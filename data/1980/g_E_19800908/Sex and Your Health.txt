Sex and Your Health
In “The Western Way of Death,” British pathologist Dr. Malcolm Carruthers comments on the role of sex in connection with heart attacks. He observes that the ‘two-timing’ adulterer is “constantly trying and failing to be in two places at once, and is likely to end up as the rope in an emotional tug-of-war between two dissatisfied women.” The ‘intense effort and excitement of sampling forbidden fruit rather than the home-grown variety’ exposes the man to the danger of a coronary attack. Many men have died of heart attacks that struck them during acts of adultery. Dr. Carruthers contrasts this with the potential physical benefits of sex relations with one’s marriage mate.
Finally, he comments on the unsatisfactory nature of masturbation: “Psychiatrists say that it is basically an aggressive act toward oneself, usually induced by frustration, as the term ‘self-abuse’ suggests. The noradrenaline release is therefore likely to be relatively large and little of the consequent rise in blood fats used up in the muscular activity involved.” He points out that since such blood fats clog arteries, there might be ‘some truth after all’ in the old sayings about physical ill-effects of masturbation.
His overall remarks support the Bible’s recommendation that single persons cultivate self-control. And that married persons should seek beneficial relief of desire in honorable marital relations.

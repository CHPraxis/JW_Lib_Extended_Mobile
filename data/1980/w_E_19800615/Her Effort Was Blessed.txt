Her Effort Was Blessed
Jehovah God blesses those who expend themselves in his service despite such problems as ill health. A certain Christian woman in Barbados writes:
“One Sunday morning when I was feeling very low in spirit and a bit depressed. I still put forth the effort to share in the house-to-house service. Most of the persons I called on that morning manifested [a lack of interest]. That made me feel more depressed. I decided, however, that I would make one more call before quitting. That final call turned out to be better than I had expected, for I later found out that the woman on whom I called was feeling much the same way I felt. She had just come out of the hospital and said she was doing her home chores but ‘crying and praying that God would send someone to comfort her.’”
The Witness was able to give the woman the comforting message of God’s promised new system of things free from sickness, crying and even death. (Rev. 21:4) This led to a regular Bible study. In just three weeks, the woman was attending Christian meetings. Soon she began sharing the “good news” with others.
“I am happy to report that this woman is now my spiritual sister,” writes the Witness. “She was baptized at the ‘Living Hope’ District Convention. I am so thankful to Jehovah that his spirit, and possibly the angels, enabled me to persevere that Sunday morning despite my physical feelings, for not only did this interested person benefit but this experience has been a source of confirmation to me of the apostle Paul’s words, ‘when I am weak, then I am powerful.’”​—2 Cor. 12:10.

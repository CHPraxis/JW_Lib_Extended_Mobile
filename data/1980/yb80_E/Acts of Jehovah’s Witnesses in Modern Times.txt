Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
The good news of the Kingdom is being preached world wide, just as Jesus said would occur before the end comes. (Matt. 24:14) Yet the tremendous witness being given today was made possible, in part, by the preaching and teaching of Jehovah’s Witnesses in previous years. In the next 223 pages, consider the lives and activities of many of the persons who shared in starting and developing the Kingdom preaching in modern times in the following five countries.
FRANCE: An obscure Swiss woodcutter started the preaching work in France around 1900. You will read with fascination how, despite difficulties such as unfaithful brothers and Nazi persecution, from that one early Witness there has today come to be a mighty army of over 67,000 Kingdom proclaimers.
LEBANON AND SYRIA: Despite recent civil war and political crisis, read how Jehovah’s Witnesses here have courageously carried on with their Kingdom activity.
ISRAEL AND JORDAN: In these countries where Jesus once walked and taught, you will learn how Bible truth is marvelously uniting Jews and Arabs.
We believe that reading these stirring reports of Christian faith in modern times will strengthen and encourage you to carry on in your service to God.

Firefighters Express Appreciation
A report on a five-alarm fire in Brooklyn, New York, appeared in “Awake!” of June 22 this year. The Hotel Margaret, across the street from the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses, was gutted by fire and subsequently was razed to the ground. “With New York Firefighters,” a quarterly magazine published by and for members of the New York Fire Department, concluded its report on this fire:
“All members operating at this fire did so under the most trying and difficult of conditions. Of necessity, many members were committed to extremely hazardous acts and performed in a most outstanding and exemplary manner.
“And, we would be remiss, indeed, if we neglected to mention those members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses who, from their headquarters across the street from the Hotel Margaret, provided food and shelter for our firefighters during the entire operation. On behalf of the entire fire-fighting force, warm and sincere appreciation is extended to these kind and dedicated people.”

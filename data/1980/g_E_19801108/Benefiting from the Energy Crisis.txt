Benefiting from the Energy Crisis
• According to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Neil Goldschmidt, as many as 37,500 people in America alone are still alive today because of the energy crisis. He contends that they would have died in auto accidents if the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit had not been introduced in 1974 to conserve energy.
• More and more cities world wide are installing garbage-burning facilities that generate power from the refuse. Not only does this help with electrical needs, but it often solves city garbage-disposal problems, including unsightly dumps and pollution.
• Many people have taken up walking to work. Benefits from this type of exercise are manifold. Says the periodical “Executive Health”: “Walking is the most efficient form of exercise . . . and the only one you can safely follow all the years of your life.”
• Bicycling has similar benefits for the body, and can be used for longer trips. In California a young mother testified to another benefit as she strapped her little one on before heading out on a shopping trip: “The bicycle has a real tranquilizing effect on my daughter.”

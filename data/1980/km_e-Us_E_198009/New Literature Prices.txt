New Literature Prices
1 Well has it been observed that ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses have covered the earth with their witnessing.’ How has this been made possible? Not by human might or power, but by God’s spirit operating upon his servants as they have made use of various provisions to fulfill their preaching and teaching commission.—Zech. 4:6; Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.
2 One of the most effective means used to accomplish our work has been the use of the printed page. Over the years billions of pieces of Bible literature in the form of books, booklets, magazines, tracts, and so forth, have been distributed to make known the Kingdom good news. Last year alone a total of 253,727,225 books, booklets and magazines were distributed world wide.
3 All over the world economic conditions are very unstable at the present time. Due to soaring inflation, the cost of living continues to rise. So does the cost of printing materials, paper, shipping and mailing. This affects the Society’s operations not only at Brooklyn but at all of our printing branches. In many countries it is necessary to subsidize the printing of publications. Hence, each year the Society must review the current situation as part of its planning for the future and then make adjustments accordingly.—Luke 14:28-30.
4 Now that a new Cost List has been prepared, we would like to have brothers keep the above points in mind when they consider the new pricing arrangement. Four copies of the new Cost List are being sent to each congregation. One copy is for the secretary. The other three copies should be given to the brothers caring for literature, magazines and accounts.
5 In making the changes set out in the new Cost List, the Society has taken into consideration the information received from all the branches. In order to care for the rising costs in many countries, including those in the United States, it has been necessary to increase the price of our literature. You will note that the congregation and public rate will be the same. This will help reduce some of the bookkeeping work. These new prices and rates will go into effect as of September 1, 1980. After the actual count of literature is taken, each congregation will be charged for the increases in prices on the basis of the September 1, 1980, actual count inventory.
6 For the information of all publishers and pioneers, the new rates are as follows:

7 We feel confident our brothers will fully cooperate with this new pricing arrangement, recognizing the reasons for the changes that have been made. We are sure Jehovah’s blessing will be upon our efforts in giving a further witness during the 1981 service year.

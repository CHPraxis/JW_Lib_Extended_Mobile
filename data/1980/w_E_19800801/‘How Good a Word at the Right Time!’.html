<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A WORD at its right time is O how good!” exclaimed the wise writer of a Bible proverb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:23-20:15:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 15:23</a>) And how true that is!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a certain eastern European land, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses were walking in a park one day and struck up a conversation with a young man strolling there with his child. This led to an invitation to the apartment of one of the Witnesses. There the man and his wife were introduced to the Bible’s message. Eventually, this couple and the young man’s mother embraced the truth of God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Interestingly, on the day that he first met the two Witnesses, the young man had stopped at a chapel in the park and had prayed: ‘God, if you exist, please let me know you.’ For three years, the man had been going for walks in that park. But on that very day he met the two witnesses of Jehovah. How fine that they were eager to spread the “good news”! The young man considered this to be God’s answer to his prayer.</p>

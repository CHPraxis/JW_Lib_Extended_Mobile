A Day Well Spent
JEHOVAH GOD blesses the sincere efforts of those who serve him. This is evident from the experience of a Christian woman in Amsterdam. Because of the opposition of her retired husband, who is nearly always at home, she rarely has the chance to join groups of Jehovah’s Witnesses as they preach the Kingdom message from house to house.
One day, however, this woman’s husband planned to go fishing. This was the first time in years that he would be away from home for a whole day. She thought of spending the day shopping or at leisure on the beach. But instead, she prayed to Jehovah and then seized the opportunity to engage in the preaching work.
At one door that day this woman placed a booklet with a man not yet entirely dressed. As she headed for the next door, he remarked: “Oh, I am so sorry you are going away. I thought you wanted to talk to me about the booklet.” So she arranged to return in a few minutes, when the man was fully dressed. He showed great interest in Bible truth, but explained that his “wife” and children had left him. Moved by his plight, the Witness visited the woman, who told her that the man drank too much and then became violent and beat her and the youngsters.
As matters turned out, at first separate Bible studies were conducted with this man and woman. Later, they were reunited, began attending Christian meetings and soon legalized their marriage. They both stopped smoking and have been making fine spiritual progress. With good reason, then, this witness of Jehovah is thankful that God so richly blessed that day well spent in his service.

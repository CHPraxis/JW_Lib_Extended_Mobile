<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Before Martin Luther produced his translation, printed versions of the Bible already existed in the German language. A handwritten German edition from about 1350 C.E. was first printed in 1466. How much did it cost? About “the equivalent of a town house, or fourteen fattened oxen.”​—“The Cambridge History of the Bible,” Vol. 3, pp. 94, 95, 423.</p>

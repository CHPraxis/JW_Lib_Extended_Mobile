<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>The Security of God’s Servants</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">LIFE under the present conditions is very insecure. Accidents, wars, revolutions, sickness and death can quickly bring about drastic changes. Almost overnight the security that a person has enjoyed may be ripped away from him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One thing, however, never changes. Because he is eternal, the Most High God can provide real security for his servants. The inspired psalmist declared: “Those trusting in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, which cannot be made to totter, but dwells even to time indefinite. Jerusalem​—as mountains are all around it, so Jehovah is all around his people from now on and to time indefinite.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:125:1-19:125:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 125:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Like other mountains, the literal Mount Zion is stable, secure. Those who put their full trust in Jehovah God will be just as firmly established. The Most High will never permit them to totter to a fall from which recovery is impossible. His protection is with his people, surrounding them as the hills and mountains encompass Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While Jehovah God may permit his people to suffer, he will not allow the situation to continue to a point of hopelessness. The psalmist expressed this conviction: “For the scepter of wickedness will not keep resting upon the lot of the righteous ones, in order that the righteous ones may not thrust out their hand upon any wrongdoing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:125:3-19:125:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 125:3</a>) The seeming triumph of the wicked and their domination will end. The oppressive rule will not be prolonged to such an extent that righteous persons crack under the strain and, perhaps in desperation, resort to improper ways for gaining relief or even turn their back on the Creator, becoming wicked themselves.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:7-21:7:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Therefore, we can always expect Jehovah God to answer the prayerful expression of the psalmist: “O do good, O Jehovah, to the good ones, even to the ones upright in their hearts. As for those turning aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah will make them go away with the practicers of what is hurtful. There will be peace upon Israel.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:125:4-19:125:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 125:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">All who continue in an upright course will benefit from the bountiful expressions of Jehovah’s goodness. But those who turn aside from walking a divinely approved way will perish with the wicked. Only those who are truly God’s servants will enjoy peace and security.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Hence, when enduring great stress or difficulty, we should never lose sight of the fact that Jehovah God is our only dependable source of security. Our faithful reliance upon him will never come to disappointment. Even if we were to die, he can restore us to life and grant us never-ending peace.</p>

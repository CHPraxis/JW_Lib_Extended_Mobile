<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Should congregation action be taken if a baptized Christian accepts a human organ transplant, such as of a cornea or a kidney?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Regarding the transplantation of human tissue or bone from one human to another, this is a matter for conscientious decision by each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some Christians might feel that taking into their bodies any tissue or body part from another human is cannibalistic. They might hold that the transplanted human material is intended to become part of the recipient’s body to keep him alive and functioning. They might not see it as fundamentally different from consuming flesh through the mouth. Such feelings may arise from considering that God did not make specific provision for man to eat the flesh of his fellowman when he made provision for humans to eat the flesh of animals that had been drained of their life-sustaining blood. They may give consideration also to the way people in Bible times viewed sustaining themselves by taking in human flesh. For example, see the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:6:24-12:6:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 6:24-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:53-5:28:57" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 28:53-57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:20-25:2:20" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Lamentations 2:20 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:4:10-25:4:10" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> La 4:10</a>. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:48-43:6:66" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 6:48-66</a>, Jesus spoke figuratively of eating his flesh and drinking his blood. On hearing this discussion and not perceiving the spiritual significance of his words, some of his Jewish disciples were shocked and turned from following him. These accounts illustrate how some humans felt about eating human flesh.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Other sincere Christians today may feel that the Bible does not definitely rule out medical transplants of human organs. They may reason that in some cases the human material is not expected to become a permanent part of the recipient’s body. Body cells are said to be replaced about every seven years, and this would be true of any human body parts that would be transplanted. It may be argued, too, that organ transplants are different from cannibalism since the “donor” is not killed to supply food. In some cases persons nearing death actually have willed body parts to be used for transplants. Of course, if a transplant should require taking in another person’s blood, undeniably that would be contrary to God’s command.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:19-44:15:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 15:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Clearly, personal views and conscientious feelings vary on this issue of transplantation. It is well known that the use of human materials for human consumption varies all the way from minor items, such as hormones and corneas, to major organs, such as kidneys and hearts. While the Bible specifically forbids consuming blood, there is no Biblical command pointedly forbidding the taking in of other human tissue. For this reason, each individual faced with making a decision on this matter should carefully and prayerfully weigh matters and then decide conscientiously what he or she could or could not do before God. It is a matter for personal decision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) The congregation judicial committee would not take disciplinary action if someone accepted an organ transplant.</p>

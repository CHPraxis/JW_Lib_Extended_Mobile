<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it proper to study or associate with disfellowshiped persons?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When individuals get together to study the Bible they do so for the purpose of learning more about true worship and its blessings. Their coming together also involves a mutual interchange of encouragement for the purpose of inciting one another to “love and fine works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) This constitutes part of our effort to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) An invitation to another to study God’s Word is actually an invitation to “let us exalt his name together.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:3-19:34:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There are rules to govern the conduct of members of “God’s household” that must be observed by all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:15-54:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:15</a>) The disfellowshiping of an individual actually constitutes his expulsion from the “brotherhood,” and members of the congregation are directed to “quit mixing in company with anyone <em>called a brother” </em>who is a deliberate wrongdoer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:11</a>) Further, Paul asked: “For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? . . . what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14, 15</a>) So, in view of this counsel, it would not be appropriate to conduct a Bible study with a disfellowshiped person, nor to associate with him. (See <em>or </em>book, pp. 171-174.)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What steps can a disfellowshiped person take toward possible reinstatement? Such a person seeking help may attend meetings open to the public. If he gives evidence of a genuine desire to pursue a right course, the elders may feel it would be justifiable to talk to him privately, giving exhortation from God’s Word in a corrective manner, which might move him to abandon his wrong course. This would not be conducted in the form of a Bible study; rather, it would be a matter of simply offering admonition directed toward his spiritual readjustment.—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1974565/8:591-21:901">August 1, 1974, <em>Watchtower, </em>pp. 468-470</a>.</p>

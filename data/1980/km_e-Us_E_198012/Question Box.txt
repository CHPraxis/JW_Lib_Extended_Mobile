● Is it proper to study or associate with disfellowshiped persons?
When individuals get together to study the Bible they do so for the purpose of learning more about true worship and its blessings. Their coming together also involves a mutual interchange of encouragement for the purpose of inciting one another to “love and fine works.” (Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10:24, 25) This constitutes part of our effort to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) An invitation to another to study God’s Word is actually an invitation to “let us exalt his name together.”—Ps. 34:3.
There are rules to govern the conduct of members of “God’s household” that must be observed by all. (1 Tim. 3:15) The disfellowshiping of an individual actually constitutes his expulsion from the “brotherhood,” and members of the congregation are directed to “quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother” who is a deliberate wrongdoer. (1 Cor. 5:11) Further, Paul asked: “For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? . . . what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” (2 Cor. 6:14, 15) So, in view of this counsel, it would not be appropriate to conduct a Bible study with a disfellowshiped person, nor to associate with him. (See or book, pp. 171-174.)
What steps can a disfellowshiped person take toward possible reinstatement? Such a person seeking help may attend meetings open to the public. If he gives evidence of a genuine desire to pursue a right course, the elders may feel it would be justifiable to talk to him privately, giving exhortation from God’s Word in a corrective manner, which might move him to abandon his wrong course. This would not be conducted in the form of a Bible study; rather, it would be a matter of simply offering admonition directed toward his spiritual readjustment.—See August 1, 1974, Watchtower, pp. 468-470.

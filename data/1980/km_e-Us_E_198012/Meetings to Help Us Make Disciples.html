Demonstrate using current Topic for Conversation highlighting presentation of Bible. Also demonstration featuring <em>Happiness </em>book.

Placements should open the way for return visits and productive discussions, leading into home Bible studies. Distinctive features of the book are designed for this purpose. Also the book provides encouragement and help toward personal application of what is learned.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">First, the vivid illustrations are valuable teaching aids. How could these be used? (Demonstrate starting Bible discussion on return visit using one or more of the illustrations.) Discussion of information is encouraged at the beginning of each chapter with the expression “POINT FOR DISCUSSION” that introduces questions at the bottom of the page. Using fewer questions, each of which involves a number of paragraphs, attention is focused on major points rather than mere details. Those answering will be encouraged to express thoughts in their own words rather than just repeating words found in the paragraphs. (Demonstrate, using first chapter.)</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Another helpful feature of the book is that it directly introduces suggestions to the student. (Demonstrate this feature as it could be used in conducting a home Bible study. See pages 25, 50, 102, 130, and others.)</p>

What makes some entertainment harmful? (2) What does the Bible say about “bodily training”? When is it beneficial? What pitfalls must be avoided? Why is it wise to keep balanced? (3) How can movies and television sometimes serve a useful purpose? When do they become a snare? How could you be influenced toward wrong conduct? (4) In such matters, what does it mean to be “selective”? What are some forms of recreation that can be refreshing without being detrimental? What always should be our chief objective in life? (For additional suggestions see <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:101979041/1-6$p/E:101979042/$p/E:101979043/$p/E:101979044/$p/E:101979045/">January 22, 1979, <em>Awake!, </em>pp. 3-12</a>.)</p>

Consider points to use in featuring latest issue to people in field service on the coming weekend. Point out that it is only by offering the subscription that we will get subscriptions.

1981 Memorial Observance
The Memorial celebration for 1981 will take place after sundown, Sunday, April 19. That will be a day when all should be especially interested in getting out into the field service and inviting new ones to assemble with us for that special occasion. Wherever possible, we recommend that each congregation arrange to have the Memorial celebration in its own Kingdom Hall rather than meeting jointly with one or more other congregations. Separate meetings provide better opportunity for new ones to meet the local brothers, including the elders and ministerial servants. In turn, they can be given better attention by the congregation. We know, of course, that there are some situations where inadequate facilities or other problems make it necessary to arrange things differently.
It is also good to arrange for a qualified elder to give the Memorial talk. Instead of the elders simply taking turns giving this talk from year to year, we feel the importance of the occasion dictates that one of the more capable speakers, anointed if available, be used and he should put extra effort into his preparation so that the discourse will be clearly understandable and motivating. We believe that this will contribute much toward achieving the maximum in spiritual benefits for all assembling for this special observance.

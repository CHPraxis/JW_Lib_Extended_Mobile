<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SEVERAL years ago two of Jehovah’s Witnesses​—a married couple engaging in full-time preaching activity as special pioneers—​came in contact with a friendly Czech family living in Switzerland. The wife was a teacher and her husband a top-ranking sportsman in rowing. Both had been raised as atheists, and when either God or the Bible was mentioned they smiled. After some discussions, the pioneers stopped visiting them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, however, “The Watchtower” contained an article about a black man who had won a gold medal as a runner at the Olympic Games in Tokyo. The Witness (whose husband died in the meantime) writes:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I remembered the Czech couple, because the husband had won a silver medal at the same Olympic Games. So this article was a signal for me to visit this family again. First, we talked about sports and I merely listened. During further visits, I spoke again and again about the Bible. But usually I was tactfully interrupted with the remark: ‘Please excuse us, Mrs.​——. You have forgotten that we are atheists.’ Despite this, I continued visiting this nice family. Somehow I felt that something was not quite in order.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Finally, I noticed that they had family problems. They were already speaking of divorce. So I showed them from the Bible how to overcome such problems. The couple was very astonished at the practical counsel contained in the Scriptures and they agreed to a Bible study. Their marriage was increasingly strengthened and they got immersed at a circuit assembly.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By water immersion, or baptism, this couple symbolized their dedication to God. Reflecting on the wholesome spiritual developments in their life, the man said:</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Previously, I just could not tolerate hearing the words ‘holy,’ ‘angel’ and similar terms. It hurt my ears. I did not want to hear anything about meetings either. But everything has changed. Now my free time belongs to God and my family. Also, as regards friends we have made changes. And now I know how important Christian meetings are. Furthermore, I have learned to assume the responsibility of a father, and we now have a happy family life. I want to thank Jehovah God again that we were permitted to learn to pray and that he offered us his hand before we searched for him.”</p>

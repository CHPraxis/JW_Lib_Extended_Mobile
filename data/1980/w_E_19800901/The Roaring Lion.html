<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE roar of a lion is an awe-inspiring sound. It may be heard over a distance of five miles (8 km). The reason for this mighty sound is twofold. It is a means of communicating with distant members of the pride and also serves as a proclamation of territory rights. Contrary to popular belief, the lion does not usually roar when hunting wild animals. However, when trying to prey upon domestic animals in an enclosure often a lion will roar. The terrifying sound is calculated to cause a stampede that breaks down the protective fence and exposes the prey.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This reminds us of the words of the apostle Peter. To fellow Christians he wrote: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>) As Christian “sheep,” secure in the protection provided by the “fine shepherd,” Christ Jesus, we do well to pay attention to Peter’s words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 10:14, 15</a>) “Keep your senses, be watchful,” says the apostle, lest the threatening roars of the Devil cause any to panic and flee into an area of spiritual danger.</p>

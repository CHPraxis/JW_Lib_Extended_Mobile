The Roaring Lion
THE roar of a lion is an awe-inspiring sound. It may be heard over a distance of five miles (8 km). The reason for this mighty sound is twofold. It is a means of communicating with distant members of the pride and also serves as a proclamation of territory rights. Contrary to popular belief, the lion does not usually roar when hunting wild animals. However, when trying to prey upon domestic animals in an enclosure often a lion will roar. The terrifying sound is calculated to cause a stampede that breaks down the protective fence and exposes the prey.
This reminds us of the words of the apostle Peter. To fellow Christians he wrote: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (1 Pet. 5:8) As Christian “sheep,” secure in the protection provided by the “fine shepherd,” Christ Jesus, we do well to pay attention to Peter’s words. (John 10:14, 15) “Keep your senses, be watchful,” says the apostle, lest the threatening roars of the Devil cause any to panic and flee into an area of spiritual danger.

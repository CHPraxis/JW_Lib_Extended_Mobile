<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Society has received numerous letters from publishers and traveling brothers stating how enjoyable and beneficial past circuit assemblies have been. These comments are appreciated and we hope you will enjoy the “Set Apart from the World” circuit assembly this fall.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With increasing pressures exerted by the world, it is vital that Jehovah’s people remain firm in faith and close to the congregation under his protection. That is why one section of the program, “Remaining Under Jehovah’s Protective Care,” will prove most beneficial to all. How we experience Jehovah’s protection today will be discussed, along with other thought-provoking information. In addition, time will be allotted to review the accomplishments made by our youths, and by the circuit as a whole.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The concluding talks will assist us to reflect on “Maintaining Our Oneness in Faith and Works” and “Our Rewarding Friendship with God.” As soon as the dates for your assembly are announced, mark your calendar and be sure to attend!</p>

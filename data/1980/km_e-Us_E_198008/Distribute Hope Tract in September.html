<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOPE—who in the world today has it? Very few indeed! That is why the tract distribution for this September should be most successful, and a work enjoyable for all. Hopefully, we will be able to engage people in Bible discussions and offer one of our recent publications as well. The contents of the tract will help interested ones to see that their hope has to be based on God’s Word. Scriptures showing what the Bible says about inflation, crime and war will help those of honest heart to see that God’s kingdom is the only solution.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We trust that you will have received your order of the HOPE tract in time for a full month of tract distribution during September. Helpful suggestions for presenting the tract will be outlined in September <em>Our Kingdom Service.</em></p>

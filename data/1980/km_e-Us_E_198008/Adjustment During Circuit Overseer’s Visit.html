<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Beginning with September there will be an adjustment in congregation meetings held during the week of the visit of the circuit overseer. The Theocratic School will be conducted for 30 minutes and will consist of Assignment No. 1 and highlights from Bible reading for the week. There will be no student talks scheduled for that week. There will also be a one-half hour talk by the circuit overseer. The regular service meeting will be conducted for one hour, thus making a two hour meeting.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Congregations may wish to conduct the service meeting first, followed by a song, and then continue with the Theocratic School and the one-half hour talk by the circuit overseer. Alternate arrangements may be preferred by some congregations and this will be left up to them.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus loved people. This was evident in his life course while on earth. He talked to people everywhere—on seashores and hillsides, in cities and villages, synagogues, marketplaces, streets and houses. He talked to large crowds, individuals, men and women, old and young, rich and poor. He knew that the message he carried was vital. It was life sustaining.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Are we following the Master’s example today? Happily, many are! We have seen fine results during the service year now ending and this is due to much hard work, along with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing. However, it is good for us to continually examine Jesus’ example and see how he cared for the responsibilities that were entrusted to him. Jesus commissioned his disciples to do the same work that he had done while on earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jesus was self-disciplined. He had personal organization. He was dependable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:37-42:21:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:37, 38</a>) In order for us to get the most done, we too need personal organization. We should be dependable and to a certain degree follow a personal schedule.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus also experienced tiredness, thirst and hunger at times. He would occasionally forgo food for the sake of the work to be done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:18-40:21:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 21:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 4:6, 7</a>) Are we self-sacrificing in our service? Are we desirous of reaching reasonable goals that we have set for ourselves? Jehovah is not asking us to be ascetic, but how can Jehovah’s spirit strengthen us if we never give of ourselves to the point that we need his help?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus showed affection and friendliness to strangers as well as to his intimate followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> John 13:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:11-43:15:15" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 15:11-15</a>) When we see the suffering that people are experiencing now, both physically and mentally, are we prompted to share our hope with them? Can we see fully the importance of the work that we have in spreading the good news of the Kingdom, knowing that this is the only hope that these folks have? Also, does our love for our brothers prompt us to show them love, overlook their mistakes and idiosyncrasies, just as we would want them to do for us? Are we following the Master’s example?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jesus took his assignment seriously. He was considerate and thoughtful of others, taking into account the limited understanding of his audience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:33-41:4:33" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 4:33</a>) Do you take special care in preparing for field service? Do you practice what you want to say? Have you found the suggestions in <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>to be helpful? Are you trying to reach the heart of individuals as Jesus did when teaching others?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 7:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jesus’ perfect example of humility and kindness should be reflected by all Christians. Our endeavors to continue to serve faithfully in the work that he has assigned will bring us contentment and the joy of helping others. Most of all, it will bring praise to our heavenly Father and his Son, our Exemplar.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE who really think about what is in the news these days know that something has gone wrong with the world​—seriously wrong. There have been times in the past when great empires have experienced turmoil and decay, but never before has the entire world been so gravely afflicted at one time.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Significantly, what is being reported in the news corresponds strikingly with what was foretold in the Bible to mark “the last days,” the “conclusion of the system of things.” Parallels show up, not merely in a few respects, but in all the details. The following are excerpts from those Bible prophecies, along with news reports from recent months.</p>

On an average they invested £8,000 ($17,000) a year on each of their soldiers compared with £130 ($275) a year on education for each school-age child. . . . In sheer tonnage, for example, there is more explosive material on earth than there is food, and investment in war machinery is running at 2,500 times that of the machinery of peace.”​—The Guardian (London), Oct. 21, 1979.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">What is reported here are only the events of recent months. The pattern has developed prominently since 1914 C.E., the year that World War I began. Check the record.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Millions of persons around the world have become convinced that these events are highly significant. They realize that, since what the Bible says about all these matters has come to pass, there is good reason to put confidence in what it foretells for the near future. And what is that? “When you see all these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near,” now to take full control of earth’s affairs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:31</a>) Under God’s kingdom, his government in the hands of Jesus Christ, it will not be the proud, the selfish and the violent who will prevail. Instead, “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth . . . and they will reside forever upon it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 29</a>) You can be one of them.</p>

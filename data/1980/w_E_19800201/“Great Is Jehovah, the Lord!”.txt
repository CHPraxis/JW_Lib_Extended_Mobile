“Great Is Jehovah, the Lord!”
Franz Schubert composed the music for this lyric entitled “The Almightiness” written by Johann Ladislav Pyrker (Opus 79/2, DV 852, 1825):
Great is Jehovah, the Lord! For heavens
and earth proclaim his power.
You hear it in the roaring storm,
in the loud rushing call of the stream of the wood;
you hear it in the rustling of the green wood,
you see it in the gold of surging crops,
in the glowing bloom of delightful flowers,
in the brightness of the star-spangled heaven,
aweful it sounds in the rolling of thunder and
flashes in the fast flickering flight of the lightning.
But the beating heart makes known to you even
more perceptibly Jehovah’s, the eternal God’s, power,
as you fervently look on high and hope for favor
and mercy.

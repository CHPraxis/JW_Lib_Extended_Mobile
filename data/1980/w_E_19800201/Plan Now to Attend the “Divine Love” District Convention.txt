Plan Now to Attend the “Divine Love” District Convention
“JEHOVAH is the Divine One, and he gives us light,” said the psalmist, adding: “Bind the festival procession with boughs, O you people, as far as the horns of the altar. You are my Divine One, and I shall laud you; my God​—I shall exalt you. Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for his loving-kindness [or, “loyal love”] is to time indefinite.” ​—Ps. 118:27-29.
In ancient times, joyous festivals of God’s people were spiritually rewarding times indeed. Especially at these gatherings could godly persons laud Jehovah and give heartfelt thanks for his unbounded loyal love.
Now you can beneficially spend time reflecting on Jehovah’s many acts of loving-kindness. You can increase your knowledge of God’s loving deeds toward mankind. Also, you can enhance your appreciation of the incomparable God of love. (1 John 4:8) How?
By being present for all the instructive, faith-building sessions of the “Divine Love” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Begin planning now to attend one of these spiritual feasts. Many of these four-day gatherings have been scheduled during the coming summer months, as noted on the following list.

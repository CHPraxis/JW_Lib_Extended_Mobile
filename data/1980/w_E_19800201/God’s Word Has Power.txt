God’s Word Has Power
The Bible can have a powerful effect on your life. It did in the case of Dionisio, who lives in the mountains of central Panama.
In 1973, Dionisio heard that some people were preaching the Bible in his area and he searched for them. He found a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses belonging to a congregation several miles away. From these Kingdom proclaimers he obtained various publications, including a small booklet entitled “Sermon Outlines,” a compilation of Biblical points and citations on many subjects.
The more Dionisio used this booklet and looked up the scriptures listed in it, the more he became interested in the Bible’s message. In fact, he began using the booklet to give “sermons” to family members and neighbors. Soon he was conducting a Bible study with one neighbor and his family, using just the Scriptures and “Sermon Outlines.”
On one occasion, a local preacher invited Dionisio to accompany him when he went to visit and “cure” a sick person. First, the preacher poured oil on the ailing individual. Then he asked Dionisio to give a talk, which he did with the help of “Sermon Outlines.” Of course, the sick person was not instantly cured, and this caused Dionisio to think seriously about the vast difference between sectarian teachings and those of the Bible.
From that time onward, Dionisio made spiritual progress, and the Witnesses helped him each time they returned to that area. He married the woman with whom he had been living, and she began studying the Bible with him. In time, she was preparing for baptism in symbol of dedication to Jehovah God. And what about Dionisio? God’s Word certainly has had power in his life, and he now serves Jehovah happily along with other Witnesses in the small local congregation.

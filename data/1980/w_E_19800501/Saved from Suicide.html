<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some witnesses of Jehovah were just concluding their preaching activity in a small German village when an elderly man walked past them with a Bible in hand. They endeavored to share the “good news” with him, but his repeated response was, ‘I want to be alone.’ As matters turned out, however, he accepted an invitation to have dinner with one of the Witnesses. The next day, another Witness called to discuss the Scriptures with this man at his place of residence, a home for the aged.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During that visit, the gentleman told the caller: “You saved my life. Yesterday I was on my way to my wife’s grave. . . . while there I was going to take my life. Before I met you yesterday, I had walked aimlessly for four hours in the forest. I looked for comfort in my hymnbook but did not find it there. You came just at the right time and I am so very thankful to God for that.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In time, it was discovered that wicked spirit forces had been driving this elderly man to suicide. But knowledge of the Scriptures enabled him to break free from such influence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11-18</a>) Also, much to his comfort, he learned that “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) Before long, he made a dedication to Jehovah God, symbolizing this by undergoing water baptism at the age of 81. Kind words and deeds, along with “comfort from the Scriptures,” had saved this elderly man from suicide and had led to the heartening prospect of eternal life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15:4</a>.</p>

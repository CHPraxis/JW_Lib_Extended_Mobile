<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Bible truth results in spiritual freedom and great happiness. Certainly, this has been so in the case of a man named Carlos, a resident of Portugal.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Back in 1968, Carlos used both direct and subtle means to discourage his wife, Olga, from studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. Finally, she discontinued the study, but still believed what she had learned from the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One day after they had moved to a new location, their three-year-old son mentioned that a Witness neighbor had called at their door. Surprisingly, Carlos had Olga invite this neighbor to their home. The Witness and his wife came and spent three hours answering Scriptural questions. They arranged to return for a Bible study the following week and left a copy of the basic Bible study aid “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.” By the time the Witnesses returned for the study, Carlos had read the entire book. Two months after starting to study he asked to attend Christian meetings. The Witnesses (then under ban in Portugal) were hesitant about that, for Carlos was an agent of the secret police. But no problems resulted.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In 1972, Carlos filed two requests for discharge from the secret police and finally this was granted. Then come the revolution of April 1974. On April 30, nine soldiers escorted him to prison, where he spent seven days. According to a recent law, all secret police agents of the former regime are subject to trial and imprisonment, with no provision for pardon. Thus, on July 10, 1979, Carlos came to trial before a military court. During the proceedings it was pointed out that he had resigned from the secret police some years earlier and was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Much to everyone’s surprise, Carlos was acquitted.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Carlos, who had taken his stand as a Christian neutral, now is an overseer in the local congregation.

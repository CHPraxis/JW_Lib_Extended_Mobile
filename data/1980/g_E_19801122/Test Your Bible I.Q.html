<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● MURMURING, SO STRUCK WITH LEPROSY—</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">Murmuring, as in the case of Miriam, is not simply a complaint about some wrongdoing. It is an expression of dissatisfaction or discontent and often is caused by placing too much emphasis on oneself. So Jehovah humiliated Miriam with leprosy for seven days.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1979046/6:157-11">“Watchtower,” 1/15/79, p. 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">● TO THE HOUSE OF A PROSTITUTE—</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">Since Samson was in enemy Philistine territory, the prostitute’s home was the only place he could find accommodations for the night. The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:1-7:16:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judges 16:1</a> does not say he hired her services, although that may have been the conclusion the Philistines drew, for they planned to wait for him until morning. Instead, at midnight he ripped out the city’s gates, leaving it defenseless.—<a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1979132/1-12">”Watchtower,” 2/15/79, p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">● BAPTISM FOR PERSONS IN POOR HEALTH?—</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">The Bible shows that baptism by complete immersion is very important. So even when unusual steps are necessary because of a person’s condition, he should be baptized if at all possible. But we can be confident that, where it is physically impossible to baptize a newly dedicated person, God will regard the situation mercifully.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1979332/1-11:617">“Watchtower,” 5/1/79, p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">● BEGINNING OF “ME-ISM”—</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Me-ism, the worship of self, goes all the way back to the first human pair, and was foretold to be present in the last days. The Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1, 2</a> says: “In the last days . . . men will be lovers of themselves.”​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:101979282/28:79-39">“Awake!,” 4/22/79, p. 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">● LOT OFFERS HIS DAUGHTERS—</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">Although Lot had at first entertained angels unawares, he later may well have realized that they were messengers from God. Hence, Lot could have felt that, as deeply attached to his daughters as he was, he would be willing to sacrifice them if necessary. Also, Lot could have been confident that, if it was Jehovah’s will, God would protect his daughters even as God had already protected Sarah in Egypt. And the daughters were kept safe.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1979891/6:228-18">“Watchtower,” 12/1/79, p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">● SHOULD CHILDREN BE SPANKED?—</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">The Bible shows that spanking does have value as a form of discipline when appropriate. “A good spanking won’t kill him,” the Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:13-20:23:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:13 and 14</a>. “As a matter of fact, it may save his life.” (Today’s English Version)​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:101979330/13-21">“Awake!,” 5/8/79, p. 28</a>.</p>

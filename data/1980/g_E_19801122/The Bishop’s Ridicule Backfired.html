<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE date was 1860. At Oxford University, the British Association for the Advancement of Science was in session. Present were evolutionist Thomas H. Huxley and a bitter opponent of the theory, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. Wilberforce, however, spoiled his argument by making “an offensive personal inquiry about Huxley’s simian ancestry.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Huxley recognized that Wilberforce had ruined his case. When he was called upon to make a reply, he said: “If . . . the question is put to me, would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means of influence, and yet who employs these faculties and that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion​—I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Wilberforce’s ridicule backfired. How much better it would have been for him to have heeded the Bible’s admonition: “A slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, . . . instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The true Christian has not only the inspired Word of God in proof of creation by an almighty, all-intelligent personal Creator, but also all the incontrovertible facts of the natural world to back up his unwavering belief in divine creation.</p>

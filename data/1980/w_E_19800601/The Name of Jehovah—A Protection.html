<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE name of Jehovah was truly a protection for a witness of Jehovah who was walking home late one night on a dark and lonely street in Italy. As he relates it:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“All of a sudden, a young man appeared before me, making me stop, and with a note of decision in his voice he said: ‘This is a holdup. Give me all the money you have.’ I stopped abruptly and right away it was clear to me that he wasn’t joking; then four other young men of from 16 to 18 years of age surrounded me with shining knives in their hands. Right away I gave them my wallet and, while one took the money in it, another took my watch and the others took what I had in my pockets. When I offered one my wedding ring, he said: ‘Not that! We won’t touch that. Rather, give me your little gold chain around your neck.’ I answered that I wore neither a chain nor an amulet because I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I had hardly finished speaking when one of them behind me said: ‘We’ve made a mistake. These are good people. I know them.’ I turned to the one who had spoken and began to witness to him, encouraging him to live honestly. While I was speaking, to my surprise each one began to give back what he had taken​—one the money, the other the watch, until I had received back everything. They asked me whether I would forgive them, and I said that on my part there was no resentment in their regard, but that, rather, they should ask Jehovah for forgiveness with heartfelt repentance. I thanked God for having protected me on that occasion.”</p>

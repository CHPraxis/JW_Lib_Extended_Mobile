<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A WITNESS of Jehovah in Newfoundland lost his job as a construction worker. Also, his children, aged four and six, needed special medical care because of being victims of cystic fibrosis. Yet the family earnestly desired to attend a Christian assembly in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SINCE it seemed impossible for the family to be present for the convention, however, the father began assisting others to attend. But the personal desire to be at that gathering never waned.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">ABOUT a week before the assembly, this Witness wondered: “Could I catch enough salmon to pay for the trip?” This possibility was remote indeed since very few salmon ever were caught in that area. One such fish in two or three weeks usually was the maximum. Moreover, the Witness did not have a fishing license.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">UNDAUNTED the Witness made arrangements for a fishing license and thereafter set the net. Surprisingly, in a few days he had caught 22 fine salmon. One of these fish was so large that it alone sold for $34.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">OTHER problems were resolved and the family was able to attend the convention. It is uncertain whether the Witness thought of the large catch of fish that Jesus Christ once supervised. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:4-42:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 5:4-9</a>) Nevertheless, this Christian man was convinced that God had blessed his efforts.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">ARE YOU planning to attend the forthcoming “Divine Love” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Do some problems stand in your way? If so, why not appeal to Jehovah God for help? His hand is not short, and you may enjoy unexpected aid that will enable you to attend that spiritually rewarding Christian assembly.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 59:1</a>.</p>

New Feature in “Awake!” Designed to Aid Us in the Field
1 “Have You Ever Wondered . . . ?” That is the heading of a new feature in Awake!, starting January 8. It takes the place of what formerly appeared as “The Bible’s View,” and, with few exceptions, it will appear on pages three and four of each magazine.
2 Why the change? It is done in order to reach persons who think they have little or no interest in religion or the Bible. In many parts of the world, anything that is labeled “Bible” tends to close the people’s mind. Of course, the new feature will still direct attention to the Bible, though usually not at the beginning of the article. We do not want to insist that the person agree that he is interested in the Bible before he starts to consider the subject.
3 The articles will cover subjects that people at the doors will be willing to discuss and that can be developed Scripturally. They will always feature the heading mentioned along with an appropriate article title. For example: “Have You Ever Wondered . . . Will People Ever Stop Hurting One Another?” The articles will be written in a down-to-earth, conversational style; they will be set in a distinctive typeface. There will be certain questions, each set in a line by itself in bold type. Bible texts will be quoted. All of this will help to make these articles in the Awake! magazine an effective means of reaching more persons with the good news. We invite you to get acquainted with this new feature and begin to use it in the field service right away.

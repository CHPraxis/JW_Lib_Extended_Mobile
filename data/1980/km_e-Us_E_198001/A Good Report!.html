<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It is a pleasure to see that Jehovah’s blessing has been on our work in the United States during the 1979 service year. Every month, on the average, there were 521,370 publishers sharing in Jehovah’s service, which represents an increase of about 1.5 percent. We had a peak of 533,781 publishers. And there was a 29-percent increase in auxiliary pioneers!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At the close of the service year, there were 7,464 congregations in operation, 19 more than last year. We saw increases in book and magazine placements. We spent more hours in the field service, made more return visits and conducted more home Bible studies. A total of 26,958 were baptized. A good report indeed! And, with you we join in praising Jehovah, who gives the increase.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6, 7</a>.</p>

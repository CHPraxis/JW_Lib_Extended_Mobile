<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>For 100 years now, <em>The Watchtower </em>has been keeping watch in a spiritual way. It has been bringing its readers “comfort from the Scriptures” and reliable guidance that only God’s Word, the Bible, can provide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:105</a>) Most of us owe much of our own spiritual development and growth to <em>The Watchtower. </em>How grateful we are for the “food at the proper time” provided by the “faithful and discreet slave.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Some observers have said, however, that people in general are no longer readers, particularly when it comes to religious material. This brings to mind the questions: What about <em>The Watchtower? </em>Is it relevant to many of the public? Does it meet their needs? In what ways can it help them?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT THE READERS SAY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>There is no doubt that <em>The Watchtower </em>does not appeal to many worldly people. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of sincere people the world over have expressed appreciation for its help. A university student in Japan said: “What particularly strengthens my faith are the clear explanations of Bible prophecies. I have been amazed by the stupendous depths of God’s wisdom that I have perceived through these wonderful articles.” A thankful young reader wrote: “When first introduced to <em>The Watchtower, </em>I was a disillusioned teen-ager. I felt insecure, had little communication with my parents, and was desperately in need of guidance. <em>The Watchtower </em>filled that need.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Besides expressing appreciation in general, many are the comments on the practical and timely material in each issue. For example, a reader in South Africa wrote: “I want to tell you how much I enjoy and benefit from the articles on the Psalms. I have always found the Psalms hard to understand and am really grateful for these articles. I feel the same way about the articles on the Sermon on the Mount.” And note this interesting comment from a Jewish reader on the article “Something New About God’s Name”: “I grew up Jewish but never did I hear that name. You can’t imagine how thrilled I was to read the irrefutable evidence <span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>in this most recent article. I cannot wait to get my hands on more copies.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>So, back to the questions: Is it relevant to many of the public? Does it meet their needs? The answer is a definite Yes! Indeed, in the pages of <em>The Watchtower </em>we have what they need, and we have every reason to be positive in recommending it to others.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>This month, we will be offering the subscription, along with a free book, on a $2.50 contribution. (See Announcements for details.) Also, you will be pleased to know that the January issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>will feature scriptures set off by themselves, or set in a box, so that they can be used easily in the field. Among them will be <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:4</a>, which point to “God’s Promise of Something New.” Endeavor to help as many as possible to see that they, too, need <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

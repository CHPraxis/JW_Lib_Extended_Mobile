Question Box
● When a congregation judicial committee, after hearing charges and considering the evidence in the case, reaches the conclusion that the accused person should be disfellowshiped, how should they deal with him?
It will be appropriate for the committee to speak with him and let him know that their decision is that he should be disfellowshiped from the congregation. They should ask him if he intends to appeal. He may do this if he believes a serious error in judgment was committed. In the event that he wishes to appeal, announcement of the disfellowshiping decision would be held in abeyance. In that case the person should be told that he will be allowed one week’s time to make his appeal in writing to the judicial committee giving his reasons. When such written appeal is received, the body of elders should arrange for an appeal committee to rehear the case within a week whenever possible. They may use local elders or elders from nearby congregations; these should be men who are experienced and qualified. If a traveling overseer can conveniently participate, or suggest who might serve on the appeal committee, it would be good. The elders may wish to telephone the branch office for counsel on forming an appeal committee. However, this usually is unnecessary.
On the other hand, if the accused person does not indicate that he wishes to appeal, the judicial committee will draw up an appropriate brief announcement to be read to the congregation. Additionally, they should explain to the accused person the need for repentance and what other steps he can take toward being reinstated in due time. This would be both helpful and kind, with the hope that he will change his ways, and with time qualify to return to Jehovah’s organization.—2 Cor. 2:6, 7.

Looking into the Infinitesimal
“The Rock [the Creator], perfect is his activity.”​—Deut. 32:4
Roman Vishniac, who pioneered microscopic photography (photomicrography), says of the miniature living world he peers into: “Nature, God, or whatever you want to call the creator of the universe, comes through the microscope clearly and strongly. Everything made by human hands looks terrible under magnification​—crude, rough and unsymmetrical. But in nature, every bit of life is lovely. And the higher the magnification we use, the more details are brought out, perfectly formed, like endless boxes within boxes.”

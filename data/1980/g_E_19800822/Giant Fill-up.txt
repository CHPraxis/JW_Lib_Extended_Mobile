Giant Fill-up
Airlines attribute much of the rapid rise in air fares to spiraling fuel costs. Just how much does it take to fuel a big jet? Says “American Way” magazine: “In 1976 it cost American [Airlines] an average of $12,925 to fill a Boeing 747 with fuel. By December 1979, the cost of a fill-up was $36,326.”

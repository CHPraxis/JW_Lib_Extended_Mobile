<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How do people rate themselves in qualities such as leadership and their own ability to get along with others? The College Board asked this of 10 million American youths. “Judging from their responses, America’s high school seniors are not wracked with inferiority,” writes psychologist David G. Myers. “In ‘leadership ability,’ 70 percent rated themselves above average, 2 percent below average. . . . In ‘ability to get along with others,’ <strong>zero </strong>percent of the 829,000 students who responded rated themselves below average; 60 percent in the top 10 percent; and 25 percent saw themselves among the top 1 percent!”</p>

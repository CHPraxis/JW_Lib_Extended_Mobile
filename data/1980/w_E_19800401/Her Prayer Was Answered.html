<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Bible furnishes evidence that angels have directed those declaring the “good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:6, 7</a>) So it is appropriate that witnesses of Jehovah pray to him for aid and success in their preaching work. In this regard, a Christian woman in Trinidad reports:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It was a cold rainy morning that I left home to meet the group for field service. My feelings corresponded with the weather, as I was feeling a bit low. . . . As my companion and I set out, I prayed in my heart to Jehovah that I should meet someone who would be genuinely interested in studying the Bible. I was still praying when we reached the first gate. We called and a young woman came out and invited us in.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A Bible discussion ensued and the young woman was invited to attend a Christian meeting. She did so, while also taking advantage of the home Bible study arranged by the Witness for her benefit. Being eager to pass on to others the good things she was learning, she began conducting a Bible study with her mother and a friend. The young woman made rapid spiritual progress and was baptized in symbol of her dedication to Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In retrospect, the Witness remarks: “Oftentimes I recall how I felt that rainy morning and thank Jehovah for answering my prayer about meeting someone who was really interested in studying the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses take very seriously their activity of sharing the “good news” with others, praying always for God’s direction and blessing on that work. Have you a desire to learn the truth of God’s Word? If so, do not hesitate to express your wish the next time a Witness calls at your door.</p>

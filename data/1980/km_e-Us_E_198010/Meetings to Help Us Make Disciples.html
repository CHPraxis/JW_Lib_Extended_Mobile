<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>“Training Our Children to Be Lovers of Jehovah.” What key points do you remember from symposium on Saturday afternoon at “Divine Love” District Convention? Chairman should use appropriate questions to draw out audience on main points and consider local application of the following:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">(1) In raising our children to become disciples, emphasize that effort must be put forth; does not happen automatically. Discuss following scriptures, noting what <em>action </em>must be taken:</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>: <em>“Train </em>up a boy . . . ” Time and effort needed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>: Greek expression for “bringing them up” means “nourishing out,” spiritually feed, nurture and develop them; “in the discipline” refers to instructing, involving training, education, and correction; “mental-regulating of Jehovah” means ‘putting in [the child’s mind] the mind of Jehovah.’ The mind and will of Jehovah are found in the Bible. Suggest that children memorize basic Bible texts. How many have been doing so, and what are the effects? (Can review texts such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Eph. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Mic. 6:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> Prov. 22:15</a>, and so forth.)</p>

Point is, start immediately while child is still like young twig. Baby’s brain reaches three quarters adult size by age two; heart doubles in size in first year. Important to reach heart.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:18-40:15:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 15:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 6:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">(2) Goal of training is in the way of God’s righteousness; must be done according to Bible standards, using Bible principles. Time and patience needed; also consistency from both parents, where possible, is important. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 3:21</a>) Chairman should briefly recount demonstrations seen at convention or have audience relate what was remembered.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Scene 1: Child speaks disrespectfully to parents in front of visiting adult. Some texts discussed were <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:22-20:23:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 23:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:24-20:13:24" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13:24</a> (obedience to parents required by God); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a> (disrespect of parental authority can lead to rebelliousness).</p>

Texts used: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matt. 20:28</a> (Jesus’ own example); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:18-54:6:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:18 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:20" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Scene 3: Child throws tantrum when not allowed to take playthings to Kingdom Hall. Texts considered: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:18-5:21:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 21:18</a> (self-will can lead to rebelliousness with serious consequence); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deut. 31:12</a> (even little ones to listen and learn at meetings); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 22:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:13-20:23:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 23:13, 14</a> (why physical rod of punishment may be necessary).</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Basic course is to reason with child, showing undesirable outcome of bad course followed, using Scriptural principle to set things straight.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"> <strong>5 min: </strong>Song 24 and prayer. (Remind audience to read October 22 <em>Awake! </em>and bring it to next week’s meeting.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 12</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Song 31, Announcements and accounts report.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201980370/">Presenting the Good News—As Families, Using <em>Awake!</em></a><em>” </em>Question-and-answer discussion of article. When considering paragraph 3, ask audience for suggestions on talking points from October 22 <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Keeping Clean for the Service of God. Talk with audience participation. Carefully consider how the material applies in your area and focus on aspects needing attention.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In many areas there is increasing lack of concern about cleanness and appearance. What have you observed in your area? How is it affecting our brothers and sisters?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bible’s emphasis on spiritual cleanness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:1-3:19:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Lev. 19:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:15, 16</a>); also evidence that physical cleanness is important. Customs of Israelites and early Christians marked them as clean people. For example, man’s leaving hair untended and garment unwashed considered signs of mourning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:24-10:19:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 19:24</a>) Hospitality included washing feet of guests, likely dirty from walking on dusty roads in sandals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:21-7:19:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 19:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:5-43:13:5" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 13:5</a>) (If time permits, can consider other examples: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:17-2:30:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 30:17-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:15-3:17:15" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Lev. 17:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:13-3:15:13" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 15:13</a>, and so forth.)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">God’s counsel “YOU must be holy” applies to us today and shows importance of personal cleanness. Christians, as ministers, have good reasons for proper grooming and personal hygiene. If we are neat, clean and well-groomed, not gaudy or untidy, it will reflect well on message we bring and on the God we worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>) Children need to be instructed on cleaning, handling clothes, eating habits, and so forth. Help them to realize it is not just to aid mother, but is related to worshiping God.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Christians also concerned about keeping home and possessions clean and orderly. Whole family should cooperate, for a clean and presentable home reflects on one’s worship. Cars and other equipment used in preaching work may also need attention.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Commendation is due for vast improvement many have made since learning truth. Encourage all to keep clean for service of God.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Elders can use this time to consider local needs or arrange to have several publishers relate experiences found on the last page of recent issues of <em>The Watchtower. </em>Local experiences may also be used.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sk">(13 min.) Stimulating the Pioneer Spirit</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sk">Many who publish weekly have pioneer spirit but cannot be regular pioneers</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sk">  Such appreciate opportunities to be auxiliary pioneers</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sk">  Appreciate need for whole-souled service (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Col. 3:23, 24</a>)</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sk">    Circumstances of individual dictate what is required to serve whole-souled (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gal. 6:4</a>)</p>

Even Birds ‘Know Their Time’
A SAD state of affairs existed among the Israelites in the time of Jeremiah. Their course contrasted unfavorably with that of migratory birds. We read: “Even the stork in the heavens​—it well knows its appointed times; and the turtledove and the swift and the bulbul​—they observe well the time of each one’s coming in. But as for my people, they have not come to know the judgment of Jehovah.”​—Jer. 8:7.
While migratory birds such as the stork, turtledove, swift and bulbul observe the time of their coming and going, the Israelites showed no regard for the judgment of Jehovah. In the case of migratory birds, their coming and going are essential for life. Likewise, Israel’s welfare and prosperity depended upon complying with Jehovah’s judgment. But the Israelites failed in this and, therefore, did not even show the good sense characteristic of unreasoning birds that observe the time of their migratory flights.

How Their Marriage Problems Were Solved
Marital problems affect millions today. Often at the roots of these difficulties are the thoughtless or even cruel acts of one mate or the other. But many have found solutions to their marriage problems. For instance, note how this happened in the case of a couple in eastern Europe.
For years, Stefan often got drunk, brutally beat his wife and squandered his money betting on race horses. Despite the hardships his wife then endured, she continued to live with him and sustained him financially. But then Stefan began studying the Bible and eventually became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Although his entire way of life had changed for the better, his wife then sought a divorce.​—1 Cor. 6:9-11.
In court, when the judge requested some reason for the divorce, this woman could say nothing bad about the current conduct of her husband. Consequently, the marriage was not dissolved. In time, the woman opened her heart to the truth and after eight months of Bible study she symbolized her dedication to God by undergoing water baptism. Today, this couple find happiness in their united worship of the merciful God, Jehovah.
Applied Christianity produces better husbands, wives and children. And the Bible provides aid in solving problems. It also gives those who accept its message a true and living hope that results in happiness.

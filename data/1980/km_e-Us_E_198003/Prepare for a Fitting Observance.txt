Prepare for a Fitting Observance
1 This year the Memorial (Nisan 14) will be celebrated after sundown on Monday, March 31, 1980. How can we as followers of Christ prepare for a fitting observance of this important occasion? One fine way is to reflect on the earthly life of Jesus, mankind’s loving, priceless Redeemer. (Matt. 20:28) To aid in this, we recommend that all of Jehovah’s people, individually or as family groups, read and review the article “He ‘Loved Them to the End’” in the March 1, 1980, issue of The Watchtower.
2 Last year a schedule was published for family Bible reading before the Memorial. It covered each of the six days of Jesus’ activity prior to his death as recorded in the book of Mark. Many families of Jehovah’s people, whole congregations and Bethel families appreciated sharing in these Bible readings.
3 We are here providing a suggested schedule for Bible reading this year. It is taken from Matthew, Luke and John. While last year’s readings were listed for the day prior to the date of the Biblical happenings, you will notice that this year’s readings are scheduled for the same day that the events actually occurred, beginning after sundown of the current calendar days.

4 Reading these passages carefully will enable each one of us to reflect upon Jesus and his activity during the closing days of his ministry. As we read this material, we should also give serious thought to our own personal standing before Jesus and Jehovah. Such self-examination, which often results in greater appreciation for spiritual things, is appropriate at any time. However, it is particularly fitting in preparation for the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal. Additionally, our zealous participation in the field service gives us opportunity to make public declaration of our faith in and appreciation for our King and Ransomer, Christ Jesus, and for Jehovah who is ‘the Giver of every good and perfect gift.’ (Jas. 1:17) In keeping with the importance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, let each of us prepare well for a fitting observance.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Crime increases. Food prices skyrocket. The energy crisis escalates. Consideration for others declines. Why? What is the meaning of these things?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you wonder, read <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>They not only report current events but explain their meaning in the light of Bible prophecy. You will receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year by sending only $5 (U.S.) to Watchtower, Wallkill,Â N.Y. 12589</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SINCE World War II Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy have grown from a few hundred individuals to over 81,000 active preachers. This growth, as well as the spiritual quality of the Italian Witnesses, has not escaped the attention of the press in Italy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Well-known Jesuit Virginio Rotondi wrote in “Il Tempo” of October 8, 1978: “[Jehovah’s Witnesses] know what they are talking about. . . . they quote a <strong>particular </strong>verse in a <strong>particular </strong>chapter from the letters of St. Paul, St. Peter, or St. John. . . . Furthermore, the new ‘converts’ soon start putting into practice and ‘preaching’ what they have learned wherever they may be. I must paradoxically admit that <strong>those </strong>Christians are experiencing an undeniable phenomenon of growth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then on August 12, 1979, “La Stampa” pointed out that Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy are “the only religious community having such a surprising growth rate. However, they practice what they preach . . . Their preaching is not just words but a way of life . . . they are the most loyal citizens anyone could wish for: they do not dodge taxes or seek to evade inconvenient laws for their own profit. The moral ideals of love for neighbor, refusal of power, non-violence and personal honesty (which for most Christians are ‘Sunday rules’ only good for being preached from the pulpit) enter into their ‘daily’ way of life.”</p>

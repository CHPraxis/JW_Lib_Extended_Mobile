Have You Tried It Yet?
1 Our objective in our preaching work from house to house and elsewhere is to communicate with people. If possible, we want to get a conversation started and then seek to interest the individuals in the message of the Kingdom that we have for them. It is not always so easy to do this.
2 To assist us, the Awake! magazine since January has featured the first article, “Have You Ever Wondered . . . ” followed by a question designed to encourage conversation. Some of the questions in the past several months have been: “If God is love, why does he permit wickedness?” “Is there any real solution to the energy crisis?” “What can keep families together?” “How many real friends do I have?” and “Will the rising cost of living ever end?”
3 Would you not agree that these are questions that many would be willing to discuss? Have you tried mentioning the question in the title and then reading the first paragraph or part of it? The opening paragraph will usually be short and will contain material designed to catch the attention of the householder. It makes it easier to start a conversation. Also, by following up with the question in the bold type after the first paragraph, you can invite the householder to express himself. This way the conversation is not one-sided, with only the Witness doing the talking.
4 Though the special April issues do not carry this feature, it will be continued in the coming months. For example, the May 8 issue will ask: “Are horoscopes reliable guides?” People today are looking for trustworthy guidance. This question could open up a fine discussion and make it possible for us to show that the Bible is the finest guide available.
5 The use of this feature in the magazine may open up many lively conversations. We individually will never know just how successful it can be unless we try it. Have you tried it yet?

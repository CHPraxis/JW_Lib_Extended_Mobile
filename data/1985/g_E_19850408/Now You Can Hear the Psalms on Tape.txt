Now You Can Hear the Psalms on Tape
Anytime​—Morning, Noon, or Night
What an inspiring way to start the day, or to take a break, or to calm yourself for sleep, or for whatever reason!
The majestic, moving thoughts expressed by the writers of the Bible psalms are now on cassettes. They are recited in a manner that gives the poetry clarity and even greater meaning.
They will be a fine addition to your family library. Five tapes, read from the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, almost six hours playing time, only $7.50, postpaid.
I enclose $7.50 (U.S.) for the five cassette tapes of all 150 psalms of the Bible. (Outside the U.S.A.: Write to local Watch Tower branch for prices.)

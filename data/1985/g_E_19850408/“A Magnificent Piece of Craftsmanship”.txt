“A Magnificent Piece of Craftsmanship”
That was a description given of the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. “I just want to thank you for this latest ‘gem,’” a mother from South Wales, Britain, wrote. “It is a magnificent piece of craftsmanship that I feel is unequaled as a teaching aid . . . I have never seen illustrations so beautiful and moving. I am using these to teach my two-year-old daughter many fine Bible truths and principles.”
The book’s 256 pages, the same page size as those in this magazine, are filled with over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. You may have this outstanding, richly bound publication by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

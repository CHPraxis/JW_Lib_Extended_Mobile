<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Anytime​—Morning, Noon, or Night</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What an inspiring way to start the day, or to take a break, or to calm yourself for sleep, or for whatever reason!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The majestic, moving thoughts expressed by the writers of the Bible psalms are now on cassettes. They are recited in a manner that gives the poetry clarity and even greater meaning.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">They will be a fine addition to your family library. Five tapes, read from the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>almost six hours playing time, only $7.50, postpaid.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I enclose $7.50 (U.S.) for the five cassette tapes of all 150 psalms of the Bible. (Outside the U.S.A.: Write to local Watch Tower branch for prices.)</p>

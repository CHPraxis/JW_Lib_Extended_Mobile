Feed Your Mind, Feed Your Spirit​—How?
Would you pay $8 to learn how alcoholism can affect you? The value of meditation? What big business does for you . . . and to you? Where we can find unity in this strife-torn world? How to cope with unemployment?
These are just a few of the thought-provoking subjects covered in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines last year. Do not miss the coming issues. It is a rich and strengthening spiritual diet. After all, man does not live by bread alone.
Please send a year’s subscription for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for prices.)

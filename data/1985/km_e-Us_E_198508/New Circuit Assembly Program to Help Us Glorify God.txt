New Circuit Assembly Program to Help Us Glorify God
“Doing Our Part in Glorifying God” is the theme of the new series of circuit assemblies starting in September. We have many reasons for wanting to glorify God. Unlike people of the world who are quick to praise men for their accomplishments while remaining blind to Jehovah’s wonderful works, our objective in life is to “do all things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) This circuit assembly program will help us to do that.
Besides featuring encouragement for pioneers and for those who may be able to take up the pioneer ministry, the Saturday program highlights the need to keep strict watch on how we walk if we are to glorify God. (Eph. 5:15, 16) Specific counsel is offered on how to avoid being ensnared by demoralizing elements in this wicked world and on the need to impale fleshly desires.
On Sunday helpful suggestions on personal Bible reading are offered. You will receive practical counsel on “Seeking God’s Glory, Not Our Own.” Newly interested ones especially will benefit from hearing the public talk identifying Scripturally the only source of global peace. All those attending this circuit assembly program should come away refreshed spiritually and strengthened in faith. Be sure to attend and invite others to be there with you.

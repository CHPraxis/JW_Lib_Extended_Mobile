<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">People are creatures of hope. After repeated disappointments, they still hope. Nowhere is this trait more apparent than in human governments. When one fails, they put hope in the next one. All forms of government have been tried, all have failed. None have had the answers to the problems afflicting mankind. Is there any hope of ever having a government that has the answers?</p>

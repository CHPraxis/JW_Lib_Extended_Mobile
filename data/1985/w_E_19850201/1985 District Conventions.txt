1985 District Conventions
YEAR after year Jehovah’s Witnesses have had basic aspects of their beliefs and activities serve as themes for their annual district convention. Among these were “Victorious Faith,” “Joyful Workers,” “Divine Love,” “Kingdom Loyalty,” and “Kingdom Unity.” The theme chosen for the 1985 district convention is likewise most basic to their activities, namely “Integrity Keepers” Convention.
How important the keeping of integrity is! It is so important that Jehovah accepted the Devil’s challenge over this issue, Jehovah being fully confident that among earth’s intelligent creatures, there would be those that would keep integrity, prove Jehovah God true and the Devil a base, gross liar.
Keeping integrity is by no means an easy, simple thing to do. It is anything but following the lines of least resistance or doing what comes natural. Knowing what is involved Satan the Devil does all within his power to cause Jehovah’s servants to break their integrity. And not only do we have Satan and his demons opposing us in our efforts to keep integrity but we also have to contend with his wicked world that brings all kinds of temptations and pressures to bear upon us. Furthermore, we have our inherited downward tendencies to resist.
To keep integrity by successfully resisting these three foes, we need all the help we can possibly get. The “Integrity Keepers” Convention is designed to give the greatest possible help to all concerned with keeping their integrity toward Jehovah God and proving the Devil a liar. As in other years the convention will, in most lands, begin on Thursday afternoon and last for four days. Make plans now to attend all four days, and come prepared to benefit fully from the program as well as to share in other convention activities.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Putting On the New Personality</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Bible commands: “Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 3:9, 10</a>) Many of those who are Jehovah’s Witnesses today were once a part of Satan’s dishonest world. On getting an accurate knowledge of what God requires of Christians, they changed, clothing themselves with the new personality. The following experiences illustrate how such changes can be made.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">□ A confirmed thief in Spain with kleptomaniac tendencies started studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. His home was full of stolen goods. As he continued to progress in accurate knowledge of Bible principles, his conscience began to bother him and he made the decision to return the things he had stolen to the owners.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">He approached his former employer and confessed that he had stolen a new washing machine from him. This man, impressed with the reasons for his changed attitude, permitted him to pay the price of the washing machine, which was $292 (U.S.), and said he would not inform the police.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Next he visited the town’s mayor and confessed that he had broken two expensive light bulbs in the city, and he offered to pay for them. Seeing that this man had put on “the new personality” due to a study of the Bible, the mayor forgave him and would not accept any payment.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The man also visited others in his neighborhood, returning stolen items, and they all expressed surprise at his great change of attitude due to applying Bible principles.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But the owners of many of the items still in his possession were unknown to him. So after praying to Jehovah, he went to police headquarters and turned in six stereo radio cassette players, which he had removed from parked cars. The police were surprised because he had a clean record with them. They had him pay a fine and serve a short time in jail.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Now he has a clean conscience before Jehovah. In harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:28-49:4:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:28</a>, “Let the stealer steal no more,” and appreciating that thieves will not “inherit God’s kingdom,” he has stopped stealing and has put on “the new personality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">□ The honesty of those with Christlike personalities is often recognized by outsiders, as illustrated by an experience in Italy. A terrible car accident was witnessed by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She approached one of the cars involved to see if she could help, and noticing a man badly injured and bleeding, she spoke to him mentioning Jehovah’s name. The man raised his head and asked if she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, to which she answered yes. He said: “Miss, I feel quite bad. I have a bag in the car that contains many millions [of lira] in cash. Please take it to your home. I know it will be in good hands. Otherwise all this money will disappear. When I am well you can return the money to me!” The Witness took the money and returned it to him when he recovered. He was very thankful.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah blesses those who “put away the old personality” and “put on the new personality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sd">“Let the stealer steal no more, but rather let him do hard work, doing with his hands what is good work, that he may have something to distribute to someone in need.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:28-49:4:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:28</a></p>

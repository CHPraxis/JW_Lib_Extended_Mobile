<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I have just finished reading <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,” </em>a woman from Chicago, Illinois, recently wrote. “Next to the Bible itself I have found this book to be the most accurate, inspiring, and motivating piece of literature I have ever read.” She went on to explain:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My first encounter with the Jehovah’s Witnesses was a rather negative one. At first I found it embarrassing when they would persistently come to visit my home to inform me of the Scriptures. Certain members of my family thought I was crazy for ever listening to them. . . . Now that I have had the chance to witness what the truth is all about by reading this book . . . I would really appreciate it if I could receive regular Bible studies with someone in the organization.”</p>

Barren Environment for Children
LITTLE BY LITTLE modern society has changed the environment for healthy child growth from a fertile one into a sterile one, says Professor Edward A. Wynne, University of Illinois. He blames extreme individualism, affluence, and the failure of religion. “It’s understandable why some parents feel embattled,” states Professor Wynne in The Wall Street Journal. “Some throw up their hands and capable married couples plan to postpone or even avoid child-rearing.” He advises counter measures, such as married couples making a serious commitment to proper child rearing, which may include associating with a religion that encourages family unity and expects involvement from its members, mixing love with discipline, and sacrificing prestigious goals.
The Bible emphasized this need centuries ago. It advises parents: “Bring them [children] up with Christian teaching in Christian discipline.” (Ephesians 6:4, Phillips) God’s Word further exhorts: “Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones . . . in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (Deuteronomy 31:12) The consistent application of these principles will surely help families to counteract the downward pull of modern society.

A Most Inspiring Book!
“I have just finished reading You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,” a woman from Chicago, Illinois, recently wrote. “Next to the Bible itself I have found this book to be the most accurate, inspiring, and motivating piece of literature I have ever read.” She went on to explain:
“My first encounter with the Jehovah’s Witnesses was a rather negative one. At first I found it embarrassing when they would persistently come to visit my home to inform me of the Scriptures. Certain members of my family thought I was crazy for ever listening to them. . . . Now that I have had the chance to witness what the truth is all about by reading this book . . . I would really appreciate it if I could receive regular Bible studies with someone in the organization.”
The book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth discusses practically every controversial Bible teaching, gathering the evidence together in such a concise and understandable way that the answer becomes clear to the reader. The publication’s 256 pages, the same page size as this magazine, contain over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. Order now. Only $2.50.

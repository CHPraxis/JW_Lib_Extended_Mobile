<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The cassette recordings of <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>are just that. A mother from Alberta, Canada, explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One day I was reading a story from <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>to my four-and-a-half-year-old son, Shaun. As I paused at one point I found that to my amazement he began to continue the story, word for word, as it appears in the <em>Bible Stories </em>book. At first I thought it was just one story that he knew. So I tried another and then another and he had memorized every one. . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“As he listens to the tape he studies the picture in the book that is associated with each story. It seems that in this way he has actually memorized, word for word, the first 33 stories, including difficult names of places and people. If he has a memory lapse, it often takes just a word and no more than three or four words to prompt him and he is able to continue again.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Have you overlooked or neglected the fabulous memory aid? The cassettes of the 116 stories in <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>give the listener an idea of what the Bible is all about. And since repeated <em>listening </em>to these accounts is such a fine memory aid, what a marvelous way this is to teach young ones! The album with the four cassettes is only $8.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I enclose $8 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for price.)</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>How Can We Strengthen One Another’s Faith? Talk and audience discussion. Elder handling this part should first draw comments from audience on practical ways to apply the following points so as to build up our own faith and strengthen this quality in others. (1) Draw close to Jehovah, Jesus Christ, and to one another within the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6</a>) (2) Make the Christian ministry one of the most important things in life and share in it with others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 2:26</a>) (3) Let the strong bear “the weaknesses of those not strong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:1-45:15:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 15:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:10</a>) (4) Encourage upbuilding conversation, <em>regular </em>Bible reading, and perseverance in prayer. Elder then explains that this takes much time and effort in our day-to-day routine. It may not be easy for some but is necessary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:3-65:1:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jude 3</a>) Why must we strengthen one another’s faith while keeping up our guard? Devil seeks to destroy our relationship with Jehovah by false teaching, loose conduct, disregard for divinely constituted authority, murmuring and complaining, selfishness. How vital is it that we strengthen one another’s faith? “The righteous one will live by reason of faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:11-48:3:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:16, 17</a>.</p>

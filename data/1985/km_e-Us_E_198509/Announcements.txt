Announcements
● Literature offer for September: Peace and Security; if not in stock, any other 192-page book for $1.00 contribution. October: Subscription for either Awake! or The Watchtower, or both, for a contribution of $4.00 for each one-year subscription. November: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures with any older 192-page book of which the congregation has a good supply, for a contribution of $4.50. December: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? for a contribution of $2.50.
● The presiding overseer or someone assigned by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.
● The recent circuit overseer’s public talk, “Prayers That Are Heard by God,” will become No. 86 in the regular series of public talks. Congregations will be sent copies of the outline and it may be assigned to local speakers after September 1, 1985.
● The Society will begin moving its Shipping Department to new facilities on October 1, 1985. Therefore, delays in shipment of literature orders can be expected during the month of October.
● We are pleased to announce that a new Cost List has been prepared. Four copies are being sent to each congregation. The secretary should keep one copy. The other three should be given to the brothers caring for the literature, magazines, and accounts.
● In addition to the languages listed on page 8 of Our Kingdom Ministry for May 1985, “Examining the Scriptures Daily”​—1986 will also be available in Arabic and Chinese.
● Subscription and distributors’ requests for the large-print edition of The Watchtower in Dutch, German, and Italian are now being accepted. The printing will not be handled in the United States but by European branches. Due to the distance and mail service, the magazines may not arrive in time for use at the Watchtower Study. However, these large-print editions are being made available so that the visually impaired are able to receive spiritual food in a form easy to read. The regular Watchtower subscription slip (M-1) and Distributors’ Order form (M-202) should be used. Please mark clearly in the upper right-hand corner, “LARGE PRINT.” Some may be interested in receiving airmail subscriptions for these large-print foreign-language magazines in order to receive them in time for the Watchtower Study. This would involve extra cost to the subscriber for the airmail postage. Any who might be interested in this special service may inquire of the Society.

Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?​—English, French, Portuguese, Spanish
Reasoning From the Scriptures​—English, Spanish
You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth (Reduced size) ​—Portuguese

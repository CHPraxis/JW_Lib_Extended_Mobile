<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I would like to thank you for the article “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Stop Watching So Much TV?” (February 22, 1985) I am 14 years old, and I am a TV-aholic. I watch TV six hours a day. But after I read your article, I decided to cut down because it stopped me from doing my homework and my Bible reading. Thanks again.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Your Voice</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">My voice has always been troublesome. An operation carried out three years ago on my vocal cords produced but little results. I am always being told that deep breathing is what I need to do, but no one has ever explained to me how to go about it. The fine article “That Marvelous Gift​—Your Voice” (August 22, 1984) is an answer to my prayers. Now I understand how my respiratory system works and what I need to do in order to bring about some improvement in my voice.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“I became pregnant and resigned myself to the fact that there was no alternative but to give birth in the normal way. I even regretted getting pregnant. Today I cried. I will take care of the child inside of me and be happy to give birth to it. Thank you very much.” These are the words of a young mother who approached me at the close of my lecture at the university. I had read the “Diary of an Unborn Child” (July 22, 1984) during the lecture. I was deeply moved by this serious article and give thanks for it. Since it came out I have used it in public places more times than I can count.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I would like to thank you for your varied, well-chosen, and upbuilding articles. As a schoolteacher and mother, I particularly appreciate the “Young People Ask . . . ” series. Your scientific articles also provide interesting information that I do not hesitate to pass on to my pupils, for I am sure that your articles are objective and honest. The only thing that upsets me a little (although I understand your reasons) is the way you constantly tear down other religions. Although I am neither a Catholic nor a Buddhist, I feel ill at ease with such articles and avoid them.</p>

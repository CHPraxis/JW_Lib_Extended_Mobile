<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY women who need extra income, but who do not want to abdicate their role as housewives, have tried an interesting alternative: working at home. In Japan over one million people engage in such work. Women are making kimonos or other clothes, hemming handkerchiefs or embroidering. Some are even assembling electrical parts for appliances or cars. And if you think we have exhausted the possibilities, here are some more: preparing food for restaurants; affixing strings to umbrellas; typing; making artificial flowers; making paper bags, labels, or bags and boxes for fruit.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before jumping at the chance to do such work, though, consider a few cautions: Beware of any advertisements that promise instant wealth. Be careful, too, when a considerable investment in machinery or tools is required. Such companies often ‘regret to inform you that they cannot provide you with work at the present time’​—after you have spent your money. Or they may fail to pay you the promised wage for so-called inferior work.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Be aware, too, that when you work at home you usually are not covered by insurance if an injury occurs. And there is the Christian obligation to pay taxes, so if you’re working for yourself, keep good records for tax purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>) Also, a self-employed person working at home should always inquire of local authorities as to zoning ordinances, mercantile regulations, education or licensing requirements, or other legal requirements.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Finally, realize that working at home takes self-discipline. Such work can be tedious and tiring. And there is the temptation to let household responsibilities slide so as to keep on working. But when properly controlled, working at home can be a practical way to balance financial and home obligations.</p>

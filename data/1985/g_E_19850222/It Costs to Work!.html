<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I DIDN’T want my wife to work,” a husband admitted. “But when ‘ends aren’t meeting,’ you have to compromise. So she started working, and that’s made things a little easier.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Throughout the world couples are saying that it is difficult to live on one income. In Australia, France, and Sweden the cost of food and housing virtually <em>doubled </em>between 1975 and 1982. In the United States the cost of feeding a family of four rose from about $67 a week in 1975 to over $100 in 1983! The cost of owning and operating an automobile in the United States nearly <em>tripled </em>between 1970 and 1981.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On and on the dreary statistics go. And when salaries do not keep up with inflation (as is often the case), couples may feel that they have but one alternative: Have the wife get a job. Best-selling author and social analyst John Naisbitt claims that if present trends continue, “85 percent of American women will be working” by the year 2000.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">All too often, though, a second income falls short of being a financial panacea. For one thing, women are generally paid much less than men are.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> True, some struggling couples welcome whatever the wife can earn. However, the authors of <em>Making It Together as a Two-Career Couple </em>further tell us: “One of the cold facts of life that many dual-career couples fail to comprehend is that <em>it costs money to earn money. </em>. . . Unless they are aware of this hard reality, couples tend to hold unrealistic expectations about the amount of disposable income they will have when both are working.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So subtract from a woman’s wage income taxes, child-care costs, food-budget increases (two-income couples rarely have time to bargain-shop and often eat either restaurant or convenience foods), transportation, clothing, and miscellaneous expenses​—and there often isn’t that much left from the wife’s salary. That’s why Joanne, a bilingual secretary and translator, quit her job. She explains: “My husband and I both . . . figured out that it would hardly be worth it.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Families are finding out that a wife’s salary also costs in other ways. And some wonder if it is worth it.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p9" data-pid="9">In the United States the average woman earns 59 percent of the average man’s salary. In Japan women make up 34 percent of the work force, yet a woman earns roughly 50 percent of what a man earns. Even in Sweden, which has “the nearest approximation to sexual equality in wages in the world,” women earn about 80 percent of what men do.</p></div>

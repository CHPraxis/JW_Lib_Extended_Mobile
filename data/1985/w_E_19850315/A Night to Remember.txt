A Night to Remember
The date Nisan 14 is the anniversary of Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. It is an anniversary the Jews were instructed to remember each year with a special meal. During it they were to explain to younger ones how the blood of the Passover lamb placed on the doorposts and above the doorway protected the firstborn of the Israelite households from God’s executional angel.​—Exodus 12:21-27.
Just 1,545 years later, also on Nisan 14, Jesus Christ instituted for his disciples in line for the heavenly Kingdom a new celebration that was to replace the Passover. During a simple ceremony, Jesus used unleavened bread and wine as symbols of his human life, which he was to sacrifice for mankind. His sacrifice has saving power superior to that of the Passover lamb. (John 1:29) When instituting the memorial of his sacrifice, Jesus said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.

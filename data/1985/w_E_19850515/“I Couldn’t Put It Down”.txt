“I Couldn’t Put It Down”
That is what an appreciative reader said after finishing the book Making Your Family Life Happy. She wrote:
“Yesterday I finished reading Making Your Family Life Happy. I couldn’t put it down until it was finished. It was just excellent. I pray that we can make proper application of all the fine points in this book.”
People who have done so have reported that their family life has improved. The book gives specific suggestions that help solve problems and make marriage the delight the Creator meant it to be. For your copy, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book Making Your Family Life Happy. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

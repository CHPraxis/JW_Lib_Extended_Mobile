‘Children Just Love Them’
Millions of families have enjoyed My Book of Bible Stories. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. Now this 256-page Bible Stories book has been recorded on four cassette tapes with a heartwarming appeal for children. A mother from Vancouver, British Columbia, writes:
“I cannot tell you how much joy we’ve received from having these tapes in our home. We have 2 girls, ages 10 and 6, and they just love following the stories with their books in their hands. I also find it a great aid in helping my younger one to read, as she can follow most of the words in the book. She can follow about 30  stories and still can’t get enough.
If you have not done so already, be sure to get these cassette tapes for your young ones. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8; playing time: 5 1/2 hours.
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.). (For price in other countries, please contact Watch Tower Society office there).

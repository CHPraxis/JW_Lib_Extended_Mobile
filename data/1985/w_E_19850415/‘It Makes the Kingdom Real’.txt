‘It Makes the Kingdom Real’
THAT is what people say about the book “Let Your Kingdom Come.” A letter of appreciation explains: “It gives a clear picture of what the Kingdom is, how it is established and maintained, and what it will do for us and for the earth. It certainly helps to keep alive in our hearts that Kingdom hope and sharpens our desire to strive diligently to be among those who will be granted life at that time.”

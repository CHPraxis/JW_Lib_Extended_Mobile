<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When a telephone operator in Texas offered fellow employees the publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>showing them the beautiful illustrations and the valuable information, they accepted a total of 50 books. She explains what happened after one woman said she would like to have a copy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I’m sorry I asked you to bring that book,” the woman said.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I didn’t know you were one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she answered, “and my husband hates you people.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Oh, I’m sorry he feels that way,” I replied. But noting that she was really impressed by the book, I said: “Please take it home and show it to him, and then if he doesn’t want it, bring it back to me.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“OK,” she said.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“The next night I met her, and she said, ‘JoAnn, I’m so happy. I took the book home and put it on the dresser. I left to go grocery shopping. When I returned, my husband was sitting with the kids reading the book to them. He asked me where I got the book, and I told him from Jehovah’s Witnesses. He said, “You know, it’s really a good book. Look at all these pictures, and at the bottom of the page it shows where to find the information in the Bible.”’”</p>

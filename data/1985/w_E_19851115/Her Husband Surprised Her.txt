Her Husband Surprised Her
When a telephone operator in Texas offered fellow employees the publication My Book of Bible Stories, showing them the beautiful illustrations and the valuable information, they accepted a total of 50 books. She explains what happened after one woman said she would like to have a copy.
“I’m sorry I asked you to bring that book,” the woman said.
“Why?” I asked.
“I didn’t know you were one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she answered, “and my husband hates you people.”
“Oh, I’m sorry he feels that way,” I replied. But noting that she was really impressed by the book, I said: “Please take it home and show it to him, and then if he doesn’t want it, bring it back to me.”
“OK,” she said.
“The next night I met her, and she said, ‘JoAnn, I’m so happy. I took the book home and put it on the dresser. I left to go grocery shopping. When I returned, my husband was sitting with the kids reading the book to them. He asked me where I got the book, and I told him from Jehovah’s Witnesses. He said, “You know, it’s really a good book. Look at all these pictures, and at the bottom of the page it shows where to find the information in the Bible.”’”

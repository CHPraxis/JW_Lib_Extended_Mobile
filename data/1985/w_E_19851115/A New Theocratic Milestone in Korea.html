<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">KEEPING pace with the rest of the world, the Kingdom-preaching work in Korea is moving forward by leaps and bounds. Just three years, almost to the day, after the branch building in Kongdo, Korea, was inaugurated, a new addition was dedicated on May 11, 1985.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> It was another milestone in the theocratic history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Korea.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As seen in the picture, the new addition consists of a third floor on the office (the right section in the picture), two additional floors on the factory (the middle section), and an adjoining three-story Bethel home (the entire left section). The structures in the background are the existing Bethel home.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But why the addition so soon? In 1982, when the new factory first went into operation, it was producing 380,000 <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines each month. This has now doubled to 760,000 each month. Clearly, the added factory space will be put to good use. To care for the increased production, there are now 86 staff members serving at the branch headquarters. The new home can more than accommodate the increase; there is now enough room for 120 members.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A. D. Schroeder, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, was on hand for the dedication program. Members of the Korean Branch Committee reported on the work in the field and gave details of the construction. All 2,199 present were filled with heartfelt thanks to Jehovah for his rich blessing.</p>

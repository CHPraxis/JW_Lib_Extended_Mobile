Now You Can Hear the Psalms on Tape​—Morning . . . Noon . . . or Night
What an inspiring way to start the day, or to take a break, or to conclude the day before going to sleep.
The majestic, moving thoughts expressed by the writers of the Bible psalms are now on cassette. They are recited in a manner that gives the poetry clarity and even greater meaning.
They will be a fine addition to your family library. Five tapes, recited from the New World Translation, almost six hours’ playing time, only $7.50, postpaid.
Enclosed please find $7.50 (U.S.) for the five cassette tapes of all 150 psalms of the Bible. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

A Youth Comforted
Late one summer, Denise became acquainted with a fellow lifeguard whose mother died when she was young and who had recently lost her father in death. “I sent her a six-month gift subscription to the Awake! magazine,” Denise explained. A couple of months later, Denise received the following letter from her:
“I read the first two issues of Awake! and two of the articles really helped me. One was on finding comfort after losing someone close, and the other was on ways to overcome depression. I can’t tell you how much they have helped me. The latter quoted Philippians 4:7, ‘The peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.’ Reading that immediately gave me new hope. Thank you so much for making me a subscriber to Awake!”

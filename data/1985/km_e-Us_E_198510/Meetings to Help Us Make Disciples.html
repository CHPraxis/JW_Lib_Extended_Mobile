Stress need to be different from present self-serving generation. The more the present system deteriorates, the greater the need to separate from it. Calls for self-sacrifice.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Increase Spirituality by Being Self-Sacrificing. Chairman discusses following points. Christians lead busy lives. Earning a living or getting necessary education, as well as maintaining our daily routine of eating, sleeping, and so forth, puts great demands on our time. Additionally, we have a full program of spiritual activity that demands priority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) Nonessential things must be sacrificed in order to care for spiritual obligations. How do families make room for weekly Bible reading schedule, preparation for congregation meetings, field service, and personal research into spiritual matters? Interview a family or two that do well. Where have they made sacrifices in order to have time for these more important things? Has TV viewing been eliminated or curtailed? What is their schedule or set time for various theocratic activities? Conclude with encouragement for all to make self-examination of how time is spent. Can each one increase spirituality by being more self-sacrificing?</p>

Invites two book study conductors to stage to discuss the remaining information from article with him. Tailor comments to fit needs of congregation. Discussion should help those in audience to see need to make public declaration of their faith.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Family Preparation for the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. Demonstration. A family on the stage prepares for next Sunday’s <em>Watchtower </em>Study. After one paragraph is read and discussed, father shows them the advantage of underlining only a few key words or phrases instead of whole sentences or large portion of paragraph. This helps to put answer in own words. Point is to get basic thought or answer from the few words underlined, understand it, and then express it in own words. Father asks them to give answer in own words. Commends. Next, father helps them see how to make an additional comment after basic answer has been given by someone else. Can apply a scripture, mention some supporting point, illustration, or example. Father then questions them on how they feel personally about material being studied. Do they agree with it, believe it, see its value, and so forth? Father assigns a younger family member to look up additional information on some point in the lesson. Suggests use of <em>Aid </em>book, older magazines, or other Society publications to help broaden knowledge and make material their own.</p>

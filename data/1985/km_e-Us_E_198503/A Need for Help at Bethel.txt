A Need for Help at Bethel
1 With the increase in proclaimers of the good news there is a need for more to serve at Bethel. (Isa. 6:8) There is much to do not only in printing and shipping literature but also in renovating newly acquired facilities.
2 Due to the nature of the work, the greatest need is for single brothers, 19 to 35 years of age. Some married couples, up to 35 years of age, can also be used. Can some of you brothers, especially those who are now in the pioneer work, make yourselves available? The organization will benefit from your help, and you will benefit from the fine training and blessings received in Bethel service.
3 Those over 35 years of age may wish to apply for regular or temporary Bethel service if they have some special skill. Their applications will be kept on file until their services are needed.
4 All who apply should be in good physical, mental, and spiritual health, be able and willing to live and work with many others, and be able to do this without taking time off because of health problems. They should be in good standing with the congregation, have a fine report from the elders and the circuit overseer, speak English well, and be willing to do whatever work is assigned. Regular applicants should have in mind staying for a number of years, learning and gaining experience as they widen out in their sacred service.​—2 Cor. 6:13.
5 If you wish to apply, obtain a Bethel application by writing to the Personnel Committee at Brooklyn or by contacting your circuit overseer. After you fill out the application it will be considered by your Congregation Service Committee and then by your circuit overseer. Those who qualify and make themselves available have the privilege, if invited to serve at Bethel, of sharing in working in cooperation with “the entire association of [our] brothers in the world.”​—1 Pet. 5:9.

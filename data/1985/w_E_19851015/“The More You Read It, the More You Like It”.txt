“The More You Read It, the More You Like It”
“You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth is the book of books second only to the Bible,” writes a reader from the Philippines. “You cannot help but like it with all your heart and soul. I’ve already read that book twice from cover to cover, yet I’m ever yearning to read it again. The more you read it, the more you like it. It’s highly instructive. . .  The book, if applied, is enough to turn the world upside down.”
This exciting publication has 256 pages, the same size as this magazine, and more than 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. Fill in and mail the accompanying coupon, along with $2.50, and receive your copy.

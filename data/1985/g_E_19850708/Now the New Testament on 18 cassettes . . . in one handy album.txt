Now the New Testament on 18 cassettes . . . in one handy album
The entire Christian Greek Scriptures (New World Translation) is now available on cassette tapes. Listen to the Bible at home while you are doing housework, or play the recordings for your children. Listen to them in your car, on the way to work, or while on trips. Listen to God’s Word when you are sick and bedridden. An attractive brown vinyl album is now available to hold your Kingdom recordings. The album, complete with the Greek Scriptures (18 cassettes), is $30.
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the entire Greek Scriptures (18 cassettes). I enclose $30 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>But what exactly is to be understood by <em>righteous </em>new heavens and a <em>righteous </em>new earth? It means that both the new heavenly government and mankind on earth ruled by it must recognize God’s standard of right and wrong. Jehovah is “the abiding place of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:7-24:50:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 50:7</a>) Righteousness is the very foundation of his sovereignty, or throne <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>position in the universe.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The question thus arises as to how the holy and righteous God Jehovah could have dealings with unrighteous sinners. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Habakkuk 1:13</a>.) How could he, while remaining faithful to his exalted standards of righteousness, choose from among sinners those who are to share in the righteous governmental “new heavens” and accept as his friends those who will be a part of the righteous “new earth”? To answer this, we must understand the Biblical doctrine of justification, or declaration of righteousness.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In the Scriptures, sins are likened to debts. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:35" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 18:21-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:4-42:11:4" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Luke 11:4</a>.)

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5. How did Jehovah provide relief for sinful mankind while still respecting his perfect justice?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>How could Jehovah provide relief for fallen mankind without compromising his own standards of righteousness? The answer highlights Jehovah’s wisdom and undeserved kindness. The apostle Paul explains this beautifully in his letter to the Romans. He writes: “It is as a free gift that they [sinners] are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus. God set him forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood. This was in order to exhibit his own righteousness, because he was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past while God was exercising forbearance; so as to exhibit his own righteousness in this present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:24-45:3:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 3:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 6. (a) How were Jehovah’s standards of justice satisfied by Christ’s sacrifice, and what is Jehovah thus willing to do? (b) How can God credit righteousness to the account of a person having faith?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>By his undeserved kindness, Jehovah accepted Jesus’ sacrifice in behalf of Adam’s descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:24-60:2:24" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:24</a>) It was an equivalent, or corresponding, sacrifice seeing that, as a perfect man, Jesus bought back what the perfect man Adam lost. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:23-2:21:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Exodus 21:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 2:6</a>.) Justice having been satisfied, Jehovah is lovingly willing to “wipe out,” or ‘blot out,’ the sins charged against the account of “the man that has faith in Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:22-23:44:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Acts 3:19</a>) If such a man remains faithful, not only does Jehovah refrain from ‘reckoning to him his trespasses’ but He actually credits righteousness to his account.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Naturally, Christ himself needed no credit of righteousness, since he was <em>really </em>righteous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18</a>) Having proved faithful unto death as a perfect man (“the last Adam”) and having sacrificed his right to life on earth, Jesus was resurrected by his Father, Jehovah. Jesus was “declared righteous in spirit,” that is, pronounced fundamentally righteous on his own merit and raised as “a life-giving spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:16-54:3:16" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 3:16</a>) By his sacrificial death, he provided the basis whereby Jehovah could credit righteousness to men and women of faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:4-45:10:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 10:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) Who are the first ones to benefit by a credit of righteousness, and why? (b) Who make up the “new heavens,” and over what will they rule?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Logically, those whom Jehovah chooses to make up the righteous “new heavens,” or Kingdom government under the King Jesus Christ, are the first to benefit fully from this merciful arrangement in this system of things. The book of Daniel depicts the ceremony in the heavens by which Christ, the Son of man, receives “rulership and dignity and kingdom,” so that “the peoples, national groups and languages [on earth] should all serve even him.” Then Daniel shows that “the kingdom and the rulership” are also given to “the holy ones of the Supreme One,” Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:18-27:7:18" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 27</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:8-66:5:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 5:8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The number of such “holy ones” chosen to rule with the Lamb Jesus Christ on the heavenly Mount Zion is revealed as being 144,000, “bought from among mankind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1-5</a>) These, together with Christ, make up the righteous “new heavens” of Jehovah’s new system of things.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Counted Righteous​—How and Why?</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10. (a) Which Bible book is the most explicit on justification, and to whom was it written? (b) Who are principally involved in the Bible doctrine of justification?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Bible book that is doubtless the most explicit on God’s declaring men righteous is Paul’s letter to the Romans. Interestingly, he addressed this letter to those “called to be holy ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:1-45:1:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 7</a>) This explains why the doctrine of “justification,” or declaration of righteousness, as outlined by Paul, is used in connection with the 144,000 “holy ones.”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">11. What relationship is there between faith, works, and justification?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The thrust of Paul’s reasoning in Romans is that neither Jew nor Gentile can obtain a righteous standing before God by means of works, whether these be done to conform to the Mosaic Law or simply out of respect for instinctive moral law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:14-45:2:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Romans 2:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:9-45:3:10" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 3:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:19-45:3:20" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) Jew and Gentile alike can be declared righteous only on the basis of faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:22-45:3:24" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Romans 3:22-24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:29-45:3:30" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 29, 30</a>) However, the counsel in the closing chapters of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:15:33" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans (12–15</a>) shows that such faith must be backed up by godly works, as James also explains. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:14-59:2:17" data-bid="31-1" class="b">James 2:14-17</a>) Such works simply prove that the justified Christian has the faith that is a prerequisite for justification by God.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">12, 13. (a) Why do the 144,000 “holy ones” need to be declared righteous? (b) What do they do with the life rights they receive?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Still, for what impelling reason do Christians who are “called to be holy ones” need to be declared righteous? This is where the second aspect of justification <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>comes into account, namely, God’s declaring a person worthy of life as His perfect human son. Due to the role they are called upon to play in the righteous “new heavens,” the 144,000 must renounce and sacrifice forever any hope of life everlasting on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 115:16</a>) In this sense they die a sacrificial death. They ‘submit themselves to a death like Christ’s.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:8-50:3:11" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Philippians 3:8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Now, in line with the principle set forth in the Mosaic Law, any sacrifice presented to Jehovah must be without defect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:21-3:22:21" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Leviticus 22:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:21-5:15:21" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 15:21</a>) The 144,000 “holy ones” are spoken of as “righteous ones who have been made perfect.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:23-58:12:23" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>While still living in the flesh, these “righteous ones” undergo a symbolic death. The apostle Paul explains: “Seeing that we died with reference to sin, how shall we keep on living any longer in it? Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, we also should likewise walk in a newness of life . . . because we know that our old personality was impaled with him, that our sinful body might be made inactive, that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin.

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">  (1) God’s accounting that person guiltless</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">  (2) God’s declaring that person perfect and worthy of everlasting life on earth</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">  The 144,000 anointed Christians are declared righteous in both respects. They sacrifice their human life rights and are begotten as spiritual “sons” called to become kings and priests with Christ in the “new heavens”</p>

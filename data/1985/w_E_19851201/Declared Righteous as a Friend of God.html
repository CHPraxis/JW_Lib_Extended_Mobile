<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Adam was created a perfect, righteous, human son of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>) His righteousness was not credited, or imputed. It was inherent. From the standpoint of guiltlessness before Jehovah, Adam had no need to be “declared” righteous. As long as he submitted to God’s legitimate rulership, he maintained a good standing before his Creator.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>However, he had not yet proved himself to be an integrity keeper and had not yet been judged worthy of the right to everlasting life on earth. For that, he had to show, over a period of time, faithfulness to Jehovah and attachment to righteousness. Had he thus proved his integrity under test, he would have received the right to everlasting life on earth. It would have been as if God had declared, or gone on record as stating, that Adam merited endless life. In symbol of this, Jehovah no doubt would have led him to “the tree of life” and allowed him to eat of its fruit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:9-1:2:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:22" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 3:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Mankind’s hope for deliverance from sin and death depended on the coming of the promised “seed,” God’s only-begotten Son.

Because of this, Jehovah kindly pardoned their sin and accepted them as his servants. He lovingly accounted them relatively guiltless, when compared to the majority of mankind alienated from God.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) Whose righteousness is the main topic of Paul’s letter to the Romans? (b) In what respects does the declaration of righteousness of the “holy ones” go beyond that of Abraham?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The case of Abraham deserves particular attention. His being declared righteous is mentioned by two writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures, both of whom were writing to first-century Christians who were called to be a part of the 144,000 members of spiritual Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:29" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 2:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:6-45:9:6" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:1-59:1:1" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> James 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Revelation 7:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In his letter to the Romans, Paul argues that those “called to be holy ones” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ro 1:7</a>), both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ro 1:16, 17</a>), are declared righteous “by faith apart from works of law.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:28-45:3:28" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ro 3:28</a>) To substantiate his argument, he opens a long explanation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:1-45:4:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ro 4:1-22</a>) and quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:6-1:15:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 15:6</a> in saying: “Abraham exercised faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” Then, in the concluding verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:1-45:4:25" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ro chapter 4</a>:25, Paul says that Jesus “was delivered up for the sake of our trespasses and was raised up for the sake of declaring us [that is, “the holy ones” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Romans 1:7</a>)] righteous.” “Us” cannot include Abraham, since he died long before Christ’s death and resurrection. Consequently, when, in the following chapters, Paul speaks of those who are to “rule as kings” and of their being declared righteous “for life” with a view to becoming “God’s sons” and “joint heirs with Christ,” he was obviously speaking of something quite different from God’s attributing righteousness to Abraham.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:17-45:5:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 5:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:14-45:8:14" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 8:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:17-45:8:17" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:28-45:8:33" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 28-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10. How does James shed light on the scope of Abraham’s being declared righteous?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>James also mentions Abraham as an example to prove that faith must be backed up by godly works. After stating that Abraham was declared righteous, quoting <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:6-1:15:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 15:6</a>, James adds a comment that helps us to see the scope of Abraham’s justification. He writes: “The scripture was fulfilled which says: ‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,’ <em>and he came to be called ‘Jehovah’s friend.’” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:20-59:2:23" data-bid="28-1" class="b">James 2:20-23</a>) Yes, due to his faith, Abraham was declared righteous <em>as a friend </em>of Jehovah, <em>not as a son with the right to perfect human life </em>or to kingship with Christ. Interestingly, in his <em>Synonyms of the Old Testament, </em>Robert Girdlestone wrote concerning Abraham’s righteousness: “This righteousness was not <em>absolute, i.e. </em>such as would commend Abraham to God as a rightful claimant of the inheritance of sonship.”</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The credit of relative righteousness to faithful men and women before Christ was a token of the real, or actual, righteousness and perfection associated with everlasting life that they may gain in God’s new earth.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) Thus they will become a part of Jesus’ “other sheep,” together with the “great crowd” who will have survived the “great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 14</a>) So doing, they will keep their names in Jehovah’s book of remembrance.</p>

Because the “sheep” do good to the remnant of Christ’s 144,000 “brothers” still on earth, they are blessed by Jesus’ Father and are called “righteous ones.” Like Abraham, they are accounted, or declared, righteous as friends of God. Their righteous standing will also mean survival for them when the “goats” depart into “everlasting cutting-off.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:25:46" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3–25:46</a>) They will “come out of the great tribulation” that will mark the end of the present wicked system of things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>.</p>

Jehovah himself will then declare them righteous in the complete sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:33-45:8:33" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Romans 8:33</a>) They will have been justified to life eternal. God will adopt them as his earthly sons, and they will enter into the promised “glorious freedom of the children of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:20-45:8:21" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Romans 8:20, 21</a>) Peace and harmony will have been restored to the universe. Reconciliation with God will be complete for “things upon the earth” and “things in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Colossians 1:20</a>) Jehovah’s merciful arrangement of justification will have served its purpose. To the question, “Are you right with God?” every creature in heaven and on earth will be able to answer yes and add: “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:13-66:5:13" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Revelation 5:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">By faith in “the blood of the Lamb,” the “other sheep” are given an approved standing before Jehovah and are thus declared righteous for friendship with him and for survival during the “great tribulation.” They will attain to perfection by the end of the Millennium. After the final test they will be declared righteous <em>for life.</em></p>

‘I Wish I Had Had It 70 Years Ago’
That is what an elderly woman said regarding the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. She wrote: “Some time ago I ordered and received from you a copy of Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. What a wonderful book! I wish I could have had something like it seventy years ago when I was a girl growing up! It is being used here, but now I am enclosing a check to you for four copies to be sent to my grandchildren who live far from me.”

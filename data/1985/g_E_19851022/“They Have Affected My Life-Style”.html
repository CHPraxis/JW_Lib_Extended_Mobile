<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man from Ghana, West Africa, said this about <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>He wrote: “I can certainly say that these magazines have won my heart over for Christ. They give one information one needs to know about Christ and salvation. When these magazines were first introduced to me by a bosom friend, I thought they would be boring. Strangely, the more I read them the more I enjoyed them. They have affected my life-style. I found them more interesting and very educative. Please,” the man concluded, “send me copies of these great magazines from month to month.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You, too, can have <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>delivered to your home. Send only $8, and you will receive both these magazines (altogether four copies a month) for one year.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

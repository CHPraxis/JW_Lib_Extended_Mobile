<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Trips to Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SPRING has arrived. And it is time for Joseph’s family, along with friends and relatives, to make their yearly trip to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. As they leave on what is about a 65-mile (105-km) journey, there is the usual excitement. Jesus is now 12 years old, and he looks forward with special interest to the festival.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To Jesus and his family, the Passover is not just a one-day affair. They also stay for the following seven-day Festival of Unfermented Cakes, which they consider part of the Passover season. So the entire trip from their home in Nazareth, including the stay in Jerusalem, takes about two weeks. But this year, due to something that involves Jesus, it takes longer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The problem comes to light on the return trip from Jerusalem. Joseph and Mary assume that Jesus is in the group of relatives or friends traveling together. Yet he does not show up when they stop for the night, and they go hunting for him among their traveling companions. He is nowhere to be found. So Joseph and Mary go all the way back to Jerusalem to look for him.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For a whole day they hunt but without success. The second day they cannot find him either. Finally, on the third day, they go to the temple. There, in one of its halls, <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>they see Jesus sitting in the midst of the Jewish teachers, listening to them and asking questions.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">‘Child, why have you done this to us?’ Mary asks. ‘Your father and I have been terribly worried, looking for you everywhere!’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus is surprised that they did not know where to find him. ‘Why did you have to look for me?’ he asks. ‘Did you not know that I must be here at my Father’s house?’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus cannot understand why his parents would not know this. At that, Jesus returns home with his parents and continues subject to them. He goes on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men. Yes, from his childhood on, Jesus sets a fine example not only in seeking spiritual interests but also in showing respect to his parents. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:40-42:2:52" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 2:40-52;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:7-42:22:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> <strong>22:7</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

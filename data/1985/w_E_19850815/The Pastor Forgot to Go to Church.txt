The Pastor Forgot to Go to Church
The following experience from the African country of Kenya shows the appeal of the instructive publication My Book of Bible Stories.
A copy of this book was placed with a pastor one morning shortly before his church service was to begin. He immediately started to look at it and became so engrossed that he forgot to go to church to conduct the religious service. In time, two ministers of the church were sent to his home, where they found him reading the Bible Stories book. The pastor started explaining to them how fascinating the book was. These also became engrossed in it and neglected to return.
After a while, the others in church went to the house of the pastor and, to their surprise, found the three men discussing My Book of Bible Stories. The result? Instead of the regular church service that morning, there was an informal discussion of the Bible Stories book. Many wanted their own copies and requested that a missionary of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses bring them one.
This 256-page, beautifully illustrated book gives the reader a broad idea of what the Bible is all about. You can obtain a copy. Simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon along with a contribution of $2.50.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With heartfelt gratitude, we join the psalmist in saying: “Praise Jah, you people! Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:1-19:106:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 106:1</a>) During August, thousands more joined Jehovah’s worshipers in unitedly saying, “Praise Jah”! The total of publishers was 27,533 more than reported last April. How glad we are, also, that a new peak of 37,220 regular pioneers was reached. This is 610 more than in May! Truly we see in this Jehovah’s blessing upon his organized people. Having rested our hope on a living God, let us continue working hard and exerting ourselves in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:10</a>.</p>

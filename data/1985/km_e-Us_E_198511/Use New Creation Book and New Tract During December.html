<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During the month of December, we will be offering the new book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>In order to effect a wide distribution, many publishers may wish to make a rather direct presentation, using the attractive new tract <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 33 as a means of introducing the book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After an appropriate greeting and introduction of yourself, show the new tract and call attention to a brief statement or an expression that you think will stimulate the person’s interest. Then offer the book for the contribution of $2.50. If the person does not accept the offer but would like to read the tract more carefully, you may leave it as a gift. Or it can be left where no one is at home.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Less experienced publishers as well as the younger children should find it quite easy to offer the <em>Creation </em>book from house to house. This would also be a good time to invite qualified new ones to start out in field service, offering this beautiful new book. Be sure also to continue offering it informally on every appropriate occasion.</p>

Use New Creation Book and New Tract During December
During the month of December, we will be offering the new book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? In order to effect a wide distribution, many publishers may wish to make a rather direct presentation, using the attractive new tract Kingdom News No. 33 as a means of introducing the book.
After an appropriate greeting and introduction of yourself, show the new tract and call attention to a brief statement or an expression that you think will stimulate the person’s interest. Then offer the book for the contribution of $2.50. If the person does not accept the offer but would like to read the tract more carefully, you may leave it as a gift. Or it can be left where no one is at home.
Less experienced publishers as well as the younger children should find it quite easy to offer the Creation book from house to house. This would also be a good time to invite qualified new ones to start out in field service, offering this beautiful new book. Be sure also to continue offering it informally on every appropriate occasion.

Sinister Music Erodes a Value System
“Punk rock and heavy metal are the ultimate philosophical end to a 30-year revolution in rock ’n’ roll’s rebelliousness,” said Darlyne Pettinicchio, deputy probation officer and gang investigator for the Orange County Probation Department, California. For most children punk and heavy-metal music is a passing fad, yet for other listeners, Pettinicchio warns in the Santa Barbara News-Press, “it’s a way of life​—a change in their value system.” She noted that “believers act out their faith in hate, violence, dope, booze, sex and death. They wind up in juvenile court, mental hospitals and cemeteries.”
Parents may refuse to let their children attend punk and heavy-metal rock concerts, but comparable music videos now appearing on television have become hard to ignore. “These music videos encourage kids to be violent and brutal toward themselves and others,” Pettinicchio said. “Especially disturbing is the portrayal of women” on such videos. “Women are dragged around, caged or walked on a leash like dogs.” Some are turning to Satanism. “We’re finding an increasing number involved in devil worship, priding themselves on communicating through occult symbols that most of us wouldn’t even notice.”
She believes that children want structure and rules on how to behave. If they don’t get them from their parents, they will seek them from their peers through gangs. She advised parents to give their children “mandatory​—that means no choice, no negotiation—​clearly stated rules with no loopholes.”

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong>Does Your Religion Really Please God?</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">‘GOD is not a God of disorder but of peace.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) Surely, then, the many religions with their conflicting doctrines could not all have God’s approval. Hence, there can be only one religion that meets his requirements for true worship. How can we find that one religion that really pleases God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Doubtless, many feel that such a search would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Sifting through it would be quite a task! Yet there is a simpler method​—using a powerful magnet. It would attract the steel needle and separate it from the straw. Likewise, the Bible can be used as a magnet to separate truth from error. But how does the Bible do that? By defining acceptable worship from God’s viewpoint.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The apostle Paul wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) Accurate knowledge of the Bible is essential if we are to avoid the pitfall of reducing religious devotion only to what is convenient or pleasing to us.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Additionally, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, stated: “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) How can we “worship with spirit and truth”? By following the truthful guidelines that God has provided, through inspiration, in his Word, the Holy Bible.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>True Worshipers Exhibit Love</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What does God’s Word lead us to expect of true worship? We have an immediate clue in three words: “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 4:16</a>) Therefore, worship that pleases God must be based on genuine love.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In practical terms, what does that mean? Religion that pleases God cannot inculcate or allow for hatred of fellow humans. The Bible’s simple command is, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>) That means separating from this world’s hatreds, prejudices, and conflicts. It means learning war no more and pursuing peace.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To illustrate the point: Could we imagine a “French” apostle Paul going out to kill a “German” apostle Peter just because their respective nations had declared war? Yet, during the second world war most religions were so deeply involved in the war efforts of their nations that they even supplied chaplains for the armies! At the same time, “Christian” clergymen on both sides prayed to the same God for victory. But does God stand divided? Can he be dragged into what Professor Albert Einstein described as the “infantile sickness” of nationalism, “the measles of humanity”? Of course not! That is why worshipers who really please God must remain neutral and practice genuine love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17:16</a>) They ‘do not wage war according to what they are in the flesh.’​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:3-47:10:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>True Worship Exalts God’s Name</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The apostle Paul pointed to another mark of religion that is pleasing to God when he said that although many are called gods and lords, among true worshipers there is only “one God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:5, 6</a>) Surely, then, those pleasing God would know and use his name.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The Bible, in its original languages, specifically mentions the name of God over 7,000 times. For instance, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a> <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>reads: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Then why do adherents of so many religions worship a nameless God? And why do they omit his name from their Bible translations? That certainly is not the way to please God, for Jesus prayed: “Let your <em>name </em>be sanctified.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>The Religion That Pleases God</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Is there any worldwide religious group that fulfills the two basic requirements of true worship that we have just discussed? Is there any religion that really practices the love that Christ taught? And do those same worshipers truly glorify God and honor his name in this 20th century?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It is a well-attested fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses maintain neutrality toward the wars of the nations. For this reason, they have suffered in concentration camps and prisons. Rather than compromising their Bible-based principles, they have preferred the pathway of martyrdom trodden by the early Christians. This stand has <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>been motivated by their love for God and fellow humans. Such love is one mark of true worship that pleases God.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Many have noted the fine record of Jehovah’s Witnesses in this respect. For example, a few years ago a South American newspaper publisher noted that the Witnesses “refuse for conscientious reasons to serve in the armed forces.” He continued: ‘Even as children, Jehovah’s Witnesses are aware that on reaching the age of eighteen they will have to serve an extended period in prison because of their neutrality. They accept the punishment as part of their religious faith. They are gentle and peaceful.’</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What about another requirement of religion that pleases God? Indeed, who honor the divine name, Jehovah? It is self-evident that only Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing this worldwide by both their preaching and their conduct.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 10:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Why not get better acquainted with Jehovah’s Witnesses? The accompanying chart lists some of their beliefs, along with Scriptural reasons for them. Submit the Witnesses’ form of worship to this simple test: Does it meet God’s standards of truth as laid down in the Bible? Is it producing the peaceable fruit of love that must form a part of true worship? Does it honor God’s name? If you find that it does all of this, you will have discovered the religion that <em>really </em>pleases God.</p>

“Solution to All Our Problems”
That is what a young person from Puerto Rico says is found in the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. He writes:
“Not too long ago I wrote to you concerning a problem I had, masturbation, and asked that you favor me with some advice by means of presenting some information in your magazine. Well, a friend of mine, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, gave me the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It to read. This happened about a month ago. I would like to let you know that since I read chapter 5 of this book, I have not practiced this habit again. I have come to realize that masturbation isn’t really something one needs. . .
“I would like it if every young person would read this book, regardless of his religious affiliation. All young people have the same problems, and this book is like a treasure, for it has the solution to all our problems. . .  You should continue publishing books for youths because in a world filled with drugs and immorality, this book is like a glass of very cool, refreshing water.”
Besides discussing masturbation and homosexuality, this book covers the use of drugs and alcohol, sports, music, dancing, dating, courtship, and many other subjects that affect youths. Receive a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

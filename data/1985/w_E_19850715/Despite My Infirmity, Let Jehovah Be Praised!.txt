Despite My Infirmity, Let Jehovah Be Praised!
THOSE who serve Jehovah God faithfully despite serious infirmities have constant evidence that he supports them. “Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.”​—Psalm 55:22.
Such comforting words have real meaning for Bill and Janice, both in their late 20’s. Married for about three years, they are associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Washington, D.C. Bill serves as a pioneer, a full-time Kingdom proclaimer, and conducts a number of home Bible studies. Four of these are held with deaf individuals.
Janice was born deaf, and complications associated with her form of deafness caused her to become blind as well. During the “Kingdom Increase” District Convention last year, Janice sat in a section reserved for the deaf, to whom the spoken word was communicated by means of sign language. Of course, since Janice is also blind, she could not get the message in that way. Therefore, an interpreter was assigned to sit next to her. By placing her hand on the dominant hand of the interpreter, Janice could “hear” the program.
During the singing of one of the Kingdom songs, an interpreter failed to appear on the platform because of a misunderstanding regarding the schedule. So Bill, who was interpreting for Janice at the time, got up on the platform with her and signed the song. She, in turn, put her hand on his and sang with the others​—something that brought tears to many eyes.
Bill and Janice have been “walking in the truth” for about two years. (3 John 4) And although Janice is physically blind and deaf, she is helping others to see and hear God’s truth. She has been blessed with three home Bible studies, all conducted in sign language because the students are also deaf. So where there is an earnest desire to praise Jehovah and help others spiritually, his servants find a way.

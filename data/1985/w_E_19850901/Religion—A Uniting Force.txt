Religion​—A Uniting Force?
HAS religion as a whole been a uniting force in the world? Or, rather, has it been a force for death and destruction? In answer we must say, the world has witnessed a century of conflict​—ignited by nationalism but fueled by religion. Since 1909, at least 14 major world conflicts have had religious roots. “From ancient times to the present,” says Ernest Lefever, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., “very few wars have been fought in which religion has not played at least some part.”
Yet, theoretically, religion should be able to keep the world at peace. Writes syndicated columnist Mike Royko: “If soldiers refused to kill somebody simply because they practice the same religion, it would be [very] hard to get a war going.” Then after noting that people of the same non-Christian faith have “been eagerly slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands,” he says: “Nor have Christians ever been squeamish about waging wars on other Christians. If they had been, most of the liveliest wars in Europe would never have occurred.”
Is it any wonder, then, that many people want nothing to do with anything that smacks of religion? The pages of history have repeatedly been bloodied by warring religionists who have either ignored God’s Word the Holy Bible or twisted its meaning to suit their own selfish interests.
However, the way of life outlined in the Bible, when correctly followed, does not lead to conflict but only to peace and unity. (Proverbs 3:1-6) Jesus urged his followers, “Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you.” (Luke 6:27) Jesus also pointed to this identifying mark of his genuine followers when he said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”​—John 13:35.

Courage to Face Death
“My husband recently died of cancer,” wrote a woman from California. “It is a disease that can destroy both hope and life. Yet the information in the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth helped my husband die with courage. It can most certainly help others to live with hope. Everyone should read it.”
This hope-inspiring publication has some 256 pages, the same size as this magazine, and is filled with over 150 illustrations, most in beautiful color. Fill in and mail the accompanying coupon, along with $2.50, and receive your copy.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. I enclose $2.50 (U.S.)

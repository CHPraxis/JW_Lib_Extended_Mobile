“No Empty Pep Talk”
That is what one reader writes regarding the new book Survival Into a New Earth. “This is one publication that won’t stay on the shelf. Once you’ve opened it you’re obliged to continue reading how your future will unfold,” he explains. “The faith-strengthening, confident choice of words can only move one to say, ‘Amen!’ I already feel butterflies and am only on chapter eight!”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">KIMBILIKITI is the ancestral religion of the Rega tribe in Kivu province, situated in east-central Zaire. Rega men hunt in the dense forests, the women fish in the rivers, and families cultivate the land. But the lives of all are completely dominated by Kimbilikiti, the great tribal spirit to whom they must show implicit obedience. And they must jealously guard all secrets associated with devotion to him, for divulging any of these is punishable by immediate death. In fact, any protest over the death of a family member at the hands of Kimbilikiti likewise results in immediate execution.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How did this powerful religion get its start? For an answer, we must look to the past.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>A Mystery in the Making</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">According to legend, very far back in tribal history a certain man had three <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>sons. Katima Rega, the firstborn, was an ugly dwarf, so handicapped that he was unable to get married. Mentally, however, he was extremely bright and possessed a very fertile imagination. He enjoyed eating to the point of gluttony. To help him get food without working, he invented some simple flutelike bamboo instruments that produced weird sounds. He also fashioned a flat, boat-shaped piece of wood with a cord attached to one end. When this device was twirled rapidly above one’s head, it produced a loud, eerie, whirring sound.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This legendary inventor first tried his devices on his two nephews, convincing them that the sounds came from a spirit and thus frightening them into stealing food and tobacco for him from his two brothers. Deciding to enlarge his field of activity, he hid in the bush and waited for the women to catch fish and put them in baskets. Then he manipulated his instruments, causing the women to return to the village in terror, leaving behind their catch.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At first, the reports of the panic-stricken women were doubted. But when the same situation kept recurring and the villagers no longer had fish to eat, the men cautiously closed in on the “demon-animal,” only to find that it was Katima Rega. Some wanted to kill him on the spot, but others concluded that what he had devised was very clever and voted to adopt “the voice” as their tribal spirit. It would be guarded as a secret and would be a mystery to all the uninitiated. Every member of the tribe would have to obey all orders, instructions, and decrees coming from “the voice,” the spirit of the forest. But what should it be called? All agreed when a wise elder suggested “Kimbilikiti.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Thus the Rega tribal religion was born. An entire framework of rules, practices, and superstitions was built up around that simple beginning. In time, three other invisible “spirits” were added as associates of Kimbilikiti. Kabile, sometimes considered his sister and at other times his wife, was a very beautiful and extraordinary woman. All adolescent males are supposed to be miraculously circumcised through sex relations with her! Twamba, a younger brother of Kimbilikiti, is said to have such strength that he can produce storms, cause houses to collapse, and so forth. His “voice” is heard through the whirring of the boat-shaped piece of wood! The third spirit is Sabikangwa, or Mukungambulu. He is another younger brother of Kimbilikiti and appears to play the role of his messenger.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Secret Initiation Rites</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the visible realm, Kimbilikiti is represented by a hierarchy of high priests (the wise Bami). One of them, called Mukuli, presides over circumcision rites. Kitumpu, another high priest, acts as doctor and actually does the circumcising of adolescents. A third, Kilezi, takes care of the newly circumcised boys. The role of mediator between the initiation camp and the ordinary villagers is played by the Bikundi, a group of those already initiated.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>The initiation rites (called Lutende) are held deep in the forest, the supposed dwelling of Kimbilikiti. Strict secrecy shrouds these rites, and any female (animal or human) venturing near the spot is strangled immediately! On initiation day, great festivities are held in the various villages, with nonstop games and dancing from early morning. This is designed to test the resistance of the young boys who will be initiated. Afterward, they listen to the history of Kimbilikiti, complete with all the myths built up over the years. The boys are made to believe that Kimbilikiti and his sister-wife Kabile are real persons. These youngsters are told to prepare themselves to struggle with Kabile, after which they will have sexual relations with her and be miraculously circumcised. If any of them fails these two tests, Kabile will angrily complain to Kimbilikiti, who will liquidate the offender!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Once in the forest, however, the boys see none of the things they were told. Instead, the three high priests (Mukuli, Kitumpu, and Kilezi) seize each one in turn and perform the circumcision. That, they say, is the struggle with Kabile! If a boy should not heal properly before the appointed time for him to return to the village, he is strangled and disposed of, for such a condition would destroy the myth of miraculous circumcision following relations with beautiful, supernatural Kabile.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Despite such high esteem for Kabile, during the initiation ceremonies the boys are taught vile sex expressions to be pronounced against women, including their own mothers and sisters. When the initiates return to their villages, women are forced to appear almost naked and walk on their knees and dance before them and to be objects of their newly learned insults.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">During the initiation periods, the Bikundi (those already initiated) go from village to village extorting food or possessions. Families are forced to give whatever is asked for Kimbilikiti and those away at the initiation camp. Roads are even blocked and passersby are obliged to pay what the devotees of Kimbilikiti demand. Perpetuated in this way is the original objective of “the voice”​—getting food without working for it.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In reality, then, what is Kimbilikiti? A hoax built around some pieces of bamboo! To uphold it, however, a system of terror has been devised with fear of death as the basic instrument. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>) The other tools are superstition, greed, and obscenity. And all of this is maintained by a hierarchy of high priests. But how could this have any bearing on persecution experienced by Jehovah’s Witnesses?</p>

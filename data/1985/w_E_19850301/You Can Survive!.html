<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE matter of survival is prominently on the minds of people worldwide. Although the Bible reveals that what faces mankind is far more awesome than the prospects that are envisioned by certain scientists, it also shows that there are dependable prospects for survival. It was most appropriate, therefore, that on the opening day of a recent international series of conventions held by Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Watch Tower Society released for widespread distribution a book entitled <em>Survival Into a New Earth. </em>What does it contain?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The book offers a realistic consideration of the problems that face us in the 1980’s. There are vital factors that people in general leave out of consideration, and as a result many see no way out of the escalating world crisis. These vital factors are brought into clear focus in the opening chapter, “What Will Become of Planet Earth?” Some people earnestly hope that election of new officials or resorting to mass protests or even violent revolution will bring them relief. But the facts show that they simply exchange one set of problems for another. The book analyzes the underlying reason for this and identifies the truly vital issues that will determine our future.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With God’s Word as the authority, this new book answers the question “How Long Will the Present System Last?” And, after showing that people now living have the prospect of surviving this world’s end, the book paints a vivid and well-founded picture of “The Kind of Life That Awaits Survivors.” It is the kind of prospect that makes any lover of righteousness want to be among the survivors. What is presented in this publication will doubtless be a source of great encouragement to millions of honest-hearted people.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Thrilling Prophetic Bible Dramas</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At the time of releasing the book <em>Survival Into a New Earth, </em>the speakers at the various conventions explained that it gives special attention to many of the thrilling prophetic Bible dramas and other prophecies that relate particularly to those who will survive the coming “great tribulation” and live forever on a paradise earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:14</a>) Those Bible dramas provide real-life examples that demonstrated how Jehovah will deal with people now living. They show what is required in order to have his favor. However, instead of simply telling us what we must do in order to gain God’s approval, these accounts make those divine requirements come to life for us. They stir our emotions and strengthen our desire to do what is right.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:1-32:3:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jonah chapter 3</a>, for example,” the convention speakers explained, “is a drama that emphasizes the need for urgent action to avoid calamity. Jehovah had commissioned Jonah to go to Nineveh, to a people who made no profession of worshiping the God of Abraham, to proclaim that their great city would be overthrown in just 40 days. How did they react? Instead of scoffing, ‘the men of Nineveh began to put faith in God.’ They proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth. In <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>response to the urging of their king, they called out earnestly to God and turned back from their bad ways. Because of their genuine repentance, Jehovah spared them. Jesus later showed that the events recorded by Jonah are not mere dead history. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:39-40:12:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 12:39-41</a>) Does their prophetic significance reach down even to our day?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Are there people today who are like those ancient Ninevites?” the speakers asked. “Yes. When Jehovah’s Witnesses deliver the divine warning that the wicked world will soon be destroyed, many who pay heed are persons who never professed to worship the God of the Bible, people who did not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left, religiously speaking. [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:11-32:4:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jonah 4:11</a>] But now they put faith in Jehovah, repent of their former ways, and become part of the ‘great crowd,’ with the prospect of surviving the ‘great tribulation.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Altogether, the book considers 21 different groups or individuals who are mentioned in the Bible and who foreshadowed people now living who will inherit the earthly realm of God’s Kingdom without dying. It also treats 26 other prophetic descriptions of this favored group who have the delightful prospect of perfect human life.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Foundation of the New Earth</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Those who are spared by Jehovah God through the coming “great tribulation” will become the foundation of the foretold new earth, being the first members of a new society, one that will spread worship of the true God around the globe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>) They will have the joy of sharing in the education of the billions who will later be raised from the dead. So, as the convention speakers pointed out, it is important that the foundation for the new earth be sound.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Right now the prospective members of that new earth are being instructed in Jehovah’s ways. They are being helped to gain heartfelt appreciation of how the issue of universal sovereignty affects our daily lives. They are learning how vital it is to ‘trust in Jehovah with all their heart and not to lean on their own understanding.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) They are being afforded opportunities to prove that they are zealous and loyal supporters of God’s Kingdom. They are gaining experience as part of a global society in which people out of all nations, languages, and races work together in loving brotherhood. Are you an active part of that group?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Rather than merely discussing the subject of survival, the new book released at the recent series of conventions held by Jehovah’s Witnesses is directed to the reader, helping him to examine his own life in the light of the requirements of God’s Word. Whether you are a new student of the Bible or one who has read it for many years, you will benefit by allowing the book <em>Survival Into a New Earth </em>to stimulate your thinking. If you have not yet read it, we urge you to do so now. Then share it with others so they, too, can embrace the marvelous prospect it presents.</p>

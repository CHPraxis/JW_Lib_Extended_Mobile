<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>From time to time <em>Awake! </em>features articles that treat subjects of special interest to certain groups of people. Although massive distributions may not be organized for these particular issues, alertness to their potential appeal in your local territory could effect a wider distribution of valuable information.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>For example, the August 8, 1985, issue of <em>Awake! </em>has a series of articles dealing with crime, its causes, and the solution. These articles should be of special interest to police officers, lawyers, judges, court personnel, prison officials, probation officers, and others involved with law enforcement.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The September 8, 1985, issue of <em>Awake! </em>will have a series of articles dealing with reading problems and will give suggestions on how to improve one’s reading ability. There may be opportunities to distribute this magazine to schoolteachers and others especially interested in education. Perhaps young Witnesses who are students would like to have a share in this distribution.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Many have had good success in placing individual copies of <em>Awake! </em>by being alert to offer selected articles to special groups most likely to be interested in that particular information. May this reminder help you to effect a wider distribution of <em>Awake! </em>in your personal territory.</p>

● If the brother who receives shipments of distributors’ magazines or literature will be away temporarily for any reason, he should notify the local post office and make arrangements for shipments to be handled properly in his absence. This will prevent delays in delivery or having shipments returned to the Society marked “Unclaimed.”

However, the material scheduled for that week may be split so that half of it is studied the week prior to the convention and the other half the week following, in addition to the material scheduled for those particular weeks. If necessary, the reading of the paragraphs may be omitted during these two studies.

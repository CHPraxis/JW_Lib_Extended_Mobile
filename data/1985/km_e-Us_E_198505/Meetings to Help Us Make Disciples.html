<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>How Many Can Auxiliary Pioneer This Summer? Chairman: Summer is an excellent time for auxiliary pioneer service. Vacation time and favorable weather make it easier to meet hour requirement. June may be a good month for you to auxiliary pioneer, and perhaps you could continue through August. What better way is there to enjoy the summer and reap lasting happy benefits? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Why not discuss as a family how many in your household can auxiliary pioneer one or more months during this summer? If some are not able to pioneer, can they assist other family members to do so? Many who have started auxiliary pioneering have gone right on into the regular pioneer service. Interview two or three publishers who have pioneered during school vacation or summer months. What blessings did they have? Did the joys make it worth the effort? Why can they recommend it to others? Encourage those who qualify to consider auxiliary pioneering this summer. With five weekends during June, your circumstances may permit you to serve as an auxiliary pioneer. If not, then demonstrate the pioneer spirit by making this summer a special time of activity by having as full a share as possible in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 12:11</a>.</p>

● Due to the Society’s relocating its Shipping Department, congregations should place orders NOW for the November Bible campaign.
● The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.
● The dramas to be presented at the “Integrity Keepers” Convention are based on Numbers 6:1-12; Deuteronomy 28:2-5; Amos 2:11-14; 3:13-15; 5:10-15 and Job chapters 1, 2, and 42. It is suggested that everyone read that material in preparation for the dramas.
● “The Bible’s Viewpoint” is the title of a new two-page feature that will appear regularly in Awake! beginning with the July 8, 1985, issue. These articles will be written for the public and will take up current questions that people are thinking about or perhaps general questions that people often ask. The articles will briefly present the view of the Bible on such questions. This feature will give publishers an alternate subject to present at the doors when they feel that the cover subject may not have as much appeal in their territory. The question to be considered in the July 8, 1985, issue is “Fate​—Does It Shape Your Future?”
● Due to necessary repairs on the Silverdome, the Pontiac, Michigan, district convention dates have been changed from June 13-16 to August 1-4, 1985. Congregations involved will receive further details.

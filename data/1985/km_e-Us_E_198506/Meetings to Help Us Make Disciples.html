<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Teach With the Use of the Magazines. Audience discussion and demonstrations. How can we use the art of teaching in presenting the magazines? Emphasize the fundamentals of good teaching: <em>Reliance on Jehovah. </em>(2 min.) Remember our message is from Jehovah; promote God’s interests and not our own. Direct attention to the Bible and its message of Kingdom good news; this is vital in reaching hearts. <em>Preparation. </em>(2 min.) We can teach someone else only what we know. Do you read the magazines? We all need to. As you read them take particular note of points that may interest the people you meet. Which articles or points will interest a man, a woman, a child, a professional person, or someone unemployed? Try to present these points in your own words. Anticipate the interests and objections of the householder. <em>Questions. </em>(2 min.) Well-phrased questions can be very effective in capturing the interest of people and drawing attention to the article you wish to feature in your presentation. Effective use of questions will help you to teach and to stimulate interest. <em>Illustrations. </em>(2 min.) Jesus taught by using word pictures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:34-40:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 13:34, 35</a>) The magazines contain actual pictures that graphically illustrate major points or lessons discussed in the material. Calling attention to these pictures involves both hearing and seeing, enhancing the effectiveness of your teaching. <em>Repetition. </em>(2 min.) Regularly returning with the latest issues may progressively help the householder to learn more about the Kingdom hope. It may also help you to build a rapport with the householder that could lead to a Bible study. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:1101971058/22:103-22$p/E:1101971059/$p/E:1101971060/1-5:259"><em>sg </em>pp. 49-54</a>)</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">(1 min.) Chairman encourages all to apply points discussed. We spend much time in the field service offering magazines. To accomplish the most, we should all try progressively to improve our ability to teach with the use of magazines.</p>

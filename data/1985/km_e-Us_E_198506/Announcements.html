<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● “The Bible’s Viewpoint” is the title of a new two-page feature that will appear regularly in <em>Awake! </em>beginning with the July 8, 1985, issue. These articles will be written for the public and will take up current questions that people are thinking about or perhaps general questions that people often ask. The articles will briefly present the view of the Bible on such questions. This feature will give publishers an alternate subject to present at the doors when they feel that the cover subject may not have as much appeal in their territory. The question to be considered in the July 8, 1985, issue is “Fate​—Does It Shape Your Future?”</p>

What Made the Difference?
A schoolteacher in Central America asked that question regarding an exemplary student of hers. The child replied that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and that each morning her family had a discussion of a Bible text published in the Witnesses’ Yearbook. From then on, the teacher asked her each day to read to the class the text and comment from the Yearbook.
You can benefit from such discussions of a Bible text. We are happy to introduce the booklet Examining the Scriptures Daily, which publishes the daily texts and comments separately from the annual Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Send only 30 cents and receive your copy of this 128-page booklet.
Please send, postpaid, the 128-page booklet Examining the Scriptures Daily. I enclose 30 cents (U.S.).

Do They Join Everything?
How religious are the Japanese? That is not an easy question to answer. However, statistics prepared by the government’s Cultural Agency do make one thing clear: Japan’s view of religion is different from that in the West. Following is what the data shows:
Shintoists ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․ 117.0 million
Buddhists ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․  87.0 million
Professed Christians ․․․․․․  1.5 million
Other religions ․․․․․․․․․․  15.0 million
 Total                     220.5 million
However, the population of Japan is only 120 million!

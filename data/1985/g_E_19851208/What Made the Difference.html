<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A schoolteacher in Central America asked that question regarding an exemplary student of hers. The child replied that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and that each morning her family had a discussion of a Bible text published in the Witnesses’ <em>Yearbook. </em>From then on, the teacher asked her each day to read to the class the text and comment from the <em>Yearbook.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You can benefit from such discussions of a Bible text. We are happy to introduce the booklet <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily, </em>which publishes the daily texts and comments separately from the annual <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>Send only 30 cents and receive your copy of this 128-page booklet.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the 128-page booklet <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily. </em>I enclose 30 cents (U.S.).</p>

Happiness
“It may be made up of little, everyday incidents; of having something to do, something to love and something to hope for. A man who was Roman emperor for twenty stirring years wrote after his retirement: ‘Could you but see the five cabbages in my garden, which I have planted and raised with my own hands, you would not ask me to relinquish such happiness for the pursuit of power.’”​—The Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter, Volume 42, No. 3.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">‘The first public school in the United States for homosexuals,’ <em>The New York Times </em>of June 6 reported. Classes began last April in a Greenwich Village church, with an enrollment of 20 students​—14 boys and 6 girls—​all homosexuals. The curriculum includes material of special interest to homosexuals and aims to teach students “to be comfortable with their own homosexuality.” Fred Goldhaber, a teacher in the school and a homosexual himself, said: “We wanted an environment where gay and lesbian kids would not be subject to immature teen-agers.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This school may make them “comfortable with their own homosexuality,” but God’s Word says that “homosexuals​—will have no share in his kingdom.” This school is just another evidence of the moral breakdown foretold for the last days.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>, <em>The Living Bible; </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>

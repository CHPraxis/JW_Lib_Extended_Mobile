New York City Public School for Homosexuals
‘The first public school in the United States for homosexuals,’ The New York Times of June 6 reported. Classes began last April in a Greenwich Village church, with an enrollment of 20 students​—14 boys and 6 girls—​all homosexuals. The curriculum includes material of special interest to homosexuals and aims to teach students “to be comfortable with their own homosexuality.” Fred Goldhaber, a teacher in the school and a homosexual himself, said: “We wanted an environment where gay and lesbian kids would not be subject to immature teen-agers.”
This school may make them “comfortable with their own homosexuality,” but God’s Word says that “homosexuals​—will have no share in his kingdom.” This school is just another evidence of the moral breakdown foretold for the last days.​—1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, The Living Bible; 2 Timothy 3:1-5.

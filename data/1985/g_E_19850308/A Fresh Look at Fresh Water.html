<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">From the Louisiana World Exposition</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">FROM May 12 to November 11 about seven million people walked along the banks of the Mississippi River in the city of New Orleans, in the United States. The city, known as the birthplace of jazz music, was playing a different tune this past year as it hosted the Louisiana World Exposition, located on an 84-acre (34-ha) site. The theme of the fair, “The World of Rivers: Fresh Water as a Source of Life,” flowed through exhibits from 25 countries. The Exposition focused attention on the worldwide importance of a good supply of fresh water and the problems connected with maintaining it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To any visitor who tended to take the supply of fresh water for granted, there were a number of startling facts to alter that view. For instance, did you know that:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">○ 100,000 gallons<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> of water are used to manufacture one automobile?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">○ 267 gallons are used to produce one pound of sugar?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">○ 300 gallons are used to yield one pound of synthetic rubber?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">○ 280 gallons are used in the making of one Sunday edition of the newspaper?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Many national exhibits featured the role water played in carving out the beauty of their land. In fact, <em>every </em>nation had pictures to showcase the truly beautiful spots in their part of the earth. And most of these were connected with rivers or lakes. Thus one commentary referred to water as “the sculptor of our landscape, the poet of our wilderness.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>A Look at the Exhibits</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">AUSTRALIA: A spokesman said, “Although Australia receives less rain than any other inhabited continent, the real message is what Australia has achieved with the water it has.” As an example, the Snowy Mountains Scheme in the southeast part of that continent is called “Australia’s greatest engineering project.” It is one of the world’s largest irrigation and power projects, taking 25 years to build. It includes about 100 miles (160 km) of tunnels, 80 miles (130 km) of aqueducts, 16 dams, and 9 power stations.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">CANADA: Unlike Australia, Canada has no water shortage. But the Canada exhibit pointed up the recent and growing <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>problem of acid rain, which is killing all life in many of the lakes along the U.S. border. It was described as “the most serious environmental problem facing today’s industrialized world.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">CHINA: The Chinese displayed books printed in the 12th century that dealt with theories on flood control, the construction of canals, dams and levees​—together with photographs of some of those structures still in use today.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">JAPAN: The theme of the Japan pavilion was “Water’s Role in Both Benefiting and Threatening Human Life.” It described flood damage in Japan as well as new technology to improve and control rivers.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Exposition leaves one with an increased awareness of our dependency on fresh water. And these following three impressions linger in the mind: Water <em>is </em>essential to life, and the Creator has generously and bountifully provided it. The waters of the earth are truly beautiful. And problems with water are largely man-made due to his selfishness or ignorance. For thinking people, the Exposition was truly a fresh look at fresh water.​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

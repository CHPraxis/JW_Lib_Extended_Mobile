Amazing Feats of Memory
A young child can remember more than you think. In a letter of thanks for the cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories, a mother from Arizona writes:
“Tonight my little four-year-old boy, Jamin, who can’t read yet, quoted several Bible stories to my husband pretty much word for word. He has been listening to them every day for a few weeks. In fact, he has to have ‘his tape’ turned on to take his nap or go to bed. Before he went to bed tonight, my husband, Sid, was reading a Bible story to Jamin. I heard Sid chuckle. Jamin had finished the story with him. He tried another but only said a couple of words before Jamin quoted it all. I suggested trying another story. Jamin did it again and again. Needless to say, we were both amazed.”
Listening to the cassettes of the 116 stories in My Book of Bible Stories is a marvelous way for young ones to learn what the Bible is all about. Are you using this fine teaching aid? The album with the four cassettes is only $8 (U.S.); playing time 5 1/2 hours.
Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

A Problem With Borrowing
“The problem with borrowing money is that as soon as one has, one inevitably begins to think of it as one’s own. One becomes used to it, treats it like family and may even come to resent or lose sight of the fact that it must all someday leave to visit someone else. Borrowing is simple. Paying back is what hurts.” So noted Parade, a Sunday newspaper magazine, regarding a psychological problem with borrowing money.
There is more to it, however, than the psychological factor. There is also the moral factor​—the obligation to pay back what is borrowed. We do well, therefore, to keep in mind Jehovah’s view of one who does not repay what he borrows. God’s Word says: “The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back.”​—Psalm 37:21.

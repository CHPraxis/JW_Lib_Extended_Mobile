<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Millions of families have enjoyed the 256-page publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. Now this <em>Bible Stories </em>book has been recorded on four cassette tapes with heartwarming appeal for children. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8. <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>which has the same page size as this magazine, with beautifully colored pictures, is only $2.50.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Under that title the Toronto publication <em>The Journal </em>recently reported that the British Medical Association had mounted a campaign against the advertising methods of the tobacco industry. The article quoted Dr. John Havard, the association’s secretary, as saying: “The tobacco industry spends millions of pounds [sterling] employing advertising, public relations, and promotional experts to help them promote a product we know​—and they should know—​is directly responsible for disease, illness, and death.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“These same consumers are our patients, and we know the truth​—that smoking causes appalling illness and so many unnecessary deaths that the figure of 100,000 premature deaths a year is almost beyond comprehension.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Tobacco companies are responsible for a massive cover-up exercise carried out world-wide by an industry which callously ignores the medical facts.”</p>

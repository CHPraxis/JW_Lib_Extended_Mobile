‘Every Day Another 274 Premature Deaths’
Under that title the Toronto publication The Journal recently reported that the British Medical Association had mounted a campaign against the advertising methods of the tobacco industry. The article quoted Dr. John Havard, the association’s secretary, as saying: “The tobacco industry spends millions of pounds [sterling] employing advertising, public relations, and promotional experts to help them promote a product we know​—and they should know—​is directly responsible for disease, illness, and death.
“Advertising, sports and arts sponsorship, competitions, clothes bearing brand names, and holidays are all part of the industry’s attempt to fool their consumers into believing smoking is glamorous, healthy, and desirable.
“These same consumers are our patients, and we know the truth​—that smoking causes appalling illness and so many unnecessary deaths that the figure of 100,000 premature deaths a year is almost beyond comprehension.
“Tobacco companies are responsible for a massive cover-up exercise carried out world-wide by an industry which callously ignores the medical facts.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">OWNERS of New York City restaurants are increasingly being confronted with patrons who demand that they be seated away from tobacco smokers. While some are repulsed at the thought of breathing in the filthy exhalations of people who smoke, others complain that the offensive, malodorous fumes from cigars, cigarettes, or pipes destroy the appetite-arousing aromas that add so much to a finely prepared meal. Richard Lavin, one restaurateur, is convinced that smokers would quickly drop this unhealthy habit if they could just see the filters of the air-cleaning machines that operate in his eating establishment. He declared that “they are so blackened, we have to give them an acid bath twice a week.”</p>

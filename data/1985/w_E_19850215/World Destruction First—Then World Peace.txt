World Destruction First​—Then World Peace
How will world destruction come? Who will be survivors? How will world peace follow? Will humans bring it about?
The Watchtower and Awake! regularly examine such vital questions, providing Bible-based answers. The past several issues of this magazine, for example, have considered these very matters.

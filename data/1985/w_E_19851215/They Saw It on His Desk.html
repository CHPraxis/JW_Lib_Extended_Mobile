<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An employee at the Milan airport in Italy laid on his desk a copy of the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, </em>leaving it open to the beautiful illustration on pages 12 and 13. As people came by they stopped and looked at the book, asking where they might get a copy. One pilot obtained the book, read it, and showed it to his crew. He returned and ordered 37 copies. A month later he asked for 48 more copies for other pilots and crew members. In time, the employee had supplied 120 books for others at the airport.</p>

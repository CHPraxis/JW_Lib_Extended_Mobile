They Saw It on His Desk
An employee at the Milan airport in Italy laid on his desk a copy of the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, leaving it open to the beautiful illustration on pages 12 and 13. As people came by they stopped and looked at the book, asking where they might get a copy. One pilot obtained the book, read it, and showed it to his crew. He returned and ordered 37 copies. A month later he asked for 48 more copies for other pilots and crew members. In time, the employee had supplied 120 books for others at the airport.

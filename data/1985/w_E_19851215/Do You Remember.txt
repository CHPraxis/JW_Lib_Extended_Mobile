Do You Remember?
How have you benefited from recent issues of The Watchtower? Why not test your memory with the following:
□ How can parents today assist their children in developing godly devotion?
Parents ought to be intensely concerned about their children’s spiritual nourishment. They should teach them to do personal study at an early age. (2 Timothy 3:15) They should also make sure that each child has his own literature, prepares for the congregation meetings, and is urged to participate in them. The regular family study should provide knowledge in line with the children’s specific needs.​—8/15, pages 23, 24.
□ What does it mean to ‘walk with God’ (Micah 6:8)?
‘Walking with God’ means adopting a way of life that harmonizes with God’s revealed will and purpose. (1 Corinthians 10:31)​—9/1, page 5.
□ Why did many of the kings of Judah fail to show complete confidence in Jehovah?
Many of the kings of Judah fell into the snare of idolatry (2 Chronicles 25:14); some were trapped by making foreign alliances (2 Chronicles 16:1-3, 7; 28:16, 20); and still others were ensnared by haughtiness. (2 Chronicles 32:25, 26; Isaiah 39:1-7)​—9/1, pages 29, 30.
□ How can imperfect humans show godlike kindness?
They can show the superior quality of godlike kindness by being kind not only to members of their own family but also to those around them who may be unthankful and have shown themselves to be enemies. (Luke 6:35)​—9/15, page 11.
□ What are some ways in which Jehovah has manifested goodness?
Jehovah’s goodness has been seen through his patient, merciful, and considerate attitude toward imperfect mankind (Exodus 34:6, 7); he has manifested goodness through his creation (Matthew 5:44, 45; Romans 1:20); it is also shown by the provision of a ransom for sinful mankind and by the Kingdom that will bring this earth to a paradise condition.​—10/1, pages 27, 28.
□ Why can the United Nations never succeed in bringing peace and security to this earth?
God never gave man the wisdom and the right to govern himself. (Jeremiah 10:23) This world is under the influence of Satan the Devil. (John 12:31; Revelation 12:9-12) The United Nations inherits this world’s weaknesses, evils, and corruption. The United Nations is trying to save this world that is opposed to God’s purposes. (1 John 2:17; Revelation 21:1)​—10/15, page 5.
□ What is a very persuasive argument for having faith in the Bible?
As a person studies the Bible and makes application thereof, it exerts a powerful motivating force for good in that one’s life. (Hebrews 4:12)​—10/15, page 23.
□ What basic truth is highlighted in the Bible record of men and angels following the path of independence?
The Bible shows that in order for man to have a successful and delightful way of life, he must be dependent on God for guidance. (Jeremiah 10:23; Proverbs 14:12)​—11/1, pages 4, 5.
□ What is one important factor that can determine how old a person should be before considering marriage?
The fruitage of God’s spirit as described in Galatians 5:22, 23 should begin showing in that person’s life long before marriage is contemplated. Hence, a determining factor would be, To what extent are these qualities already in evidence in the young person’s life?​—11/1, page 18.
□ How can mildness act as a protective covering to shield us from harm?
When faced with a potentially explosive situation, the anger of the offended person may be diffused by application of the proverb: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” (Proverbs 15:1)​—11/15, page 6.
□ Can those having hope of everlasting life on earth be declared righteous even now?
Those chosen by God for heavenly life must, even now, be declared righteous; perfect human life is imputed to them. (Romans 8:1) This is not necessary now for those who may live forever on earth. But such ones can now be declared righteous as friends of God, as was faithful Abraham. (James 2:21-23; Romans 4:1-4) After such ones achieve actual human perfection at the end of the Millennium and then pass the final test, they will be in position to be declared righteous for everlasting human life.​—12/1, pages 10, 11, 17, 18.

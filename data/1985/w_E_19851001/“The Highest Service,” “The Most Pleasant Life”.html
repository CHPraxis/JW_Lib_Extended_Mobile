<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As a result of his deep study of the Christian Greek Scriptures, John Wycliffe, the courageous 14th-century Bible translator, came to an interesting conclusion about man’s responsibility to the Almighty God. According to H. C. Conant’s book <em>The English Bible, </em>Wycliffe concluded that <em>“the highest service to which man may attain on earth is to preach the word of God.”</em> Some centuries later another Bible scholar, Matthew Henry, came to a similar conclusion. On his deathbed in 1714, he observed: <em>“A life spent in the service of God, and communion with him, is the most pleasant life that any one can live in this world.”</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Well over two and a half million active Jehovah’s Witnesses wholeheartedly concur!  They experience this “most pleasant life.” Why? Because they preach the good news of the Kingdom worldwide, thus obeying the exhortation: “Praise Jah, you people, . . . for it is pleasant.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:1-19:147:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 147:1</a>.</p>

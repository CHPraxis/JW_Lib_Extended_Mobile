<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Earlier this year the following letter was received by the publishers of <em>The Watchtower:</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sh">“Dear Sir:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Last month in Philadelphia my teenage daughter had her wallet stolen from her backpack bookbag. Last week in the mail she received a package containing her wallet and her license and other important cards. The package was sent by someone who wished not to be identified, except that the package also contained a copy of your publication <em>The Watchtower. </em>Whoever did this act of brotherly love (from the city of brotherly love) had apparently found the wallet thrown away by the thief and went to some trouble and expense to return it to my daughter. My family and I are grateful to this kind person . .  It was a great way to ‘witness,’ especially to my teenagers (3 of them).”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Reading <em>The Watchtower </em>has beneficially affected the lives of millions, cultivating in them the qualities of honesty, kindness, and consideration.

You can receive a year’s subscription to <em>The Watchtower, </em>two issues a month, by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon, along with $4.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send me <em>The Watchtower. </em>I enclose $4 (U.S.).</p>

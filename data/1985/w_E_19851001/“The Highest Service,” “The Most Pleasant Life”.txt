“The Highest Service,” “The Most Pleasant Life”
As a result of his deep study of the Christian Greek Scriptures, John Wycliffe, the courageous 14th-century Bible translator, came to an interesting conclusion about man’s responsibility to the Almighty God. According to H. C. Conant’s book The English Bible, Wycliffe concluded that “the highest service to which man may attain on earth is to preach the word of God.” Some centuries later another Bible scholar, Matthew Henry, came to a similar conclusion. On his deathbed in 1714, he observed: “A life spent in the service of God, and communion with him, is the most pleasant life that any one can live in this world.”
Well over two and a half million active Jehovah’s Witnesses wholeheartedly concur!  They experience this “most pleasant life.” Why? Because they preach the good news of the Kingdom worldwide, thus obeying the exhortation: “Praise Jah, you people, . . . for it is pleasant.”​—Psalm 147:1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE brochure <em>School and Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>was provided to help school authorities understand why Witness youths do not share in certain school functions and programs. It also serves to help Jehovah’s Witnesses explain why, as a result of their beliefs, they take the position that they do.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, for the brochure to fulfill its stated purpose, <em>“to promote understanding and cooperation between Jehovah’s Witnesses and school authorities,” </em>Witness families first need to study it themselves and then see that teachers receive a copy. Those who have put the <em>School </em>brochure to use have enjoyed fine results.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For example, on May 6, 1983, the Ministry of Education in the Bahamas sent out a circular that set out the morning assembly exercises for all schools. The last sentence in the circular stated: “Please note that no discretion is allowed in matters relating to National Symbols.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But, then, in the summer of 1983, the <em>School </em>brochure was released at the conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses and put to use in the Bahamas. Evidently as a direct result of such use, when a new circular was sent to the principals of schools on January 18, 1984, there was a complete reversal on the matter of national symbols. In the last paragraph under the heading “STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN PATRIOTIC ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOL,” the circular said:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Saluting the flag and the national anthem are intended to instill national pride and sense of patriotism in the people and the nation. As long as there are different nations, the flag and national anthems will have their place in organised society. Nevertheless, if a particular group has as one of the tenets of its religion that the singing of the national anthem and the saluting of the flag are pagan and therefore forbidden, then the constitution requires that they must be allowed the freedom so to teach and to think.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Appreciation by School Authorities</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">School authorities appreciate very much knowing how the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses affect their participation in school activities. A copy of the brochure was left with Mr. Andre Lemieux, the principal of the Chibougamau School Board in Quebec, Canada, and he later told the Witness who had provided it: “Your teaching requires that we exempt your children from holiday celebrations and we don’t understand why, although they explain it to us. But with this brochure, we will understand your children much better and take your moral principles into consideration.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">He then asked: “Would it be possible to have eight for all the schools, at least one for each school?” When told that this would be no problem, he said: “In that case, I will take 40 to start with.” He added, “If every religion would explain its teaching, we would have fewer problems with the children. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A Witness parent in the state of Kentucky in the United States explained that her children had a new principal, so she went to school to talk with him, taking along the <em>School </em>brochure. “He examined it closely,” she noted, “and wanted to know if I could get any more. I was surprised when he asked for 25 more. He said that he would like to give one to each teacher.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This mother also talked with her children’s teachers. They told her that they did not mind working with Witness children but that sometimes they could not understand the reasons for their actions. However, the mother wrote: “After reading the brochure, many of their questions were answered, and this has made school much easier for my children and other Witness children in the same school.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">A mother from New York City writes that her 8-year-old twin daughters were having a problem making their teachers understand their beliefs. <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>“One particular teacher who teaches them music was very upset over matters of national songs and holidays,” she said. “Our daughters tried to explain their stand to him and gave him the brochure.” With what result? He thanked them, and later wrote them regarding the brochure:</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“It sets out very clearly exactly what the Witnesses think about the various holidays and why they do not participate in them. Some of the reasons I knew before, but some of them I didn’t. As a teacher I feel that the more that I am acquainted with the various religions of my students, the better I will be able to understand them.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Appreciation by Witness Youths</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The brochure is especially appreciated by young ones. “Another benefit was my children’s reactions,” a mother from British Columbia, Canada, writes. “Being a mother with an unbelieving husband at times proves difficult when it comes to reinforcing Jehovah’s view on holidays, flag, etc. But with the girls knowing that the teacher actually <em>expected </em>them to be different, the way was paved for them. They are coming home telling me of the times they have taken a stand, when before they were somewhat fearful. They have also related to me occasions where the teacher has quietly helped them out of situations with a kind word or two.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">A number of young people have written to tell how the brochure has helped them. A youngster from Chicago, Illinois, told about a teacher that was pressuring her to run for homecoming queen. “The next day I brought the brochure,” the girl said, “and as soon as she read the part on homecoming queen she said I didn’t have to have any part in the contest. It was as easy as that.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">A youth from Georgia, in the United States, explains that her teacher, to whom she gave the brochure, kindly excused her from participating in certain activities after reading it. “This brochure is very important to the young people in school,” the youth wrote, “and I would like to thank you for it. It’s nice to know the Society is thinking of the young people who have to face these problems.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The <em>School </em>brochure is indeed a fine instrument to help promote understanding and cooperation between Jehovah’s Witnesses and school authorities. Are you using it?</p>

“My Guide, My Counselor”
The book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It has served as such for a youth from Senegal, West Africa. “As a Muslim,” he explains, “I was greatly impressed by the way you examine problems of youth. You wisely deal with adolescence. Your book is for me more than a book​—it is my guide, my counselor, and will be so for always.
“Being a fatherless child since the age of eleven, I lived with my grandmother until I was nineteen. Now I am twenty. If my way of life has a good influence on people around me, it is thanks to the Youth book. I cannot count how many times I have read and reread it. Every subject you deal with gives me the feeling it is especially for me. I have also shared your book with all my friends. They, too, say it is a treasure house of knowledge.”
Included in this publication’s 24 chapters are: “How Do You View Discipline?” “Should You Drink Alcoholic Beverages?” “The Music and Dancing You Choose,” “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” and “Dating and Courtship.” You can obtain this fine aid to successful living by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with a remittance of only $1.

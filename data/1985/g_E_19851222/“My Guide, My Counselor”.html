<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>has served as such for a youth from Senegal, West Africa. “As a Muslim,” he explains, “I was greatly impressed by the way you examine problems of youth. You wisely deal with adolescence. Your book is for me more than a book​—it is my guide, my counselor, and will be so for always.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Being a fatherless child since the age of eleven, I lived with my grandmother until I was nineteen. Now I am twenty. If my way of life has a good influence on people around me, it is thanks to the <em>Youth </em>book. I cannot count how many times I have read and reread it. Every subject you deal with gives me the feeling it is especially for me. I have also shared your book with all my friends. They, too, say it is a treasure house of knowledge.”</p>

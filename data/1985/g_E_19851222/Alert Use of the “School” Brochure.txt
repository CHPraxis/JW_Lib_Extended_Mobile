Alert Use of the “School” Brochure
THE Watchtower Society publishes a brochure entitled “School and Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Its purpose is to acquaint teachers and other school authorities with Witness beliefs that affect participation in school activities. The following account by a teenage Witness illustrates the potential of such provisions when Witnesses are alert and use them effectively.
“I obtained a list of superintendents and other administrators in the county school systems in Georgia. Brochures were sent to those in Atlanta and surrounding areas. I sent 350 and received requests for 2,000 additional copies. My father and I visited 42 principals. Many expressed appreciation and the wish that ‘all religions would provide such helpful information.’ In most schools visited, a brochure was given to each homeroom teacher, and copies were placed in the school libraries.
“In addition to the brochure, we placed 32 copies of the book Your Youth, Getting the Best out of It and 140 copies of the Awake! issue dealing with ‘Child Molestation.’ Several principals asked permission to use excerpts from these publications in school newsletters, PTA bulletins, and talks before student-body assemblies. One principal invited us to return to speak to the faculty about the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses. My father spoke for 20 minutes, and afterward we placed several more books and magazines. Also, we received a request from Mr. Samuel Wallace of the Planning and Expanded Services office in Atlanta. He requested copies of the brochure and the Awake! magazine for each of the 30 social workers who visit the elementary schools as counselors.
“Following all of this, we received four other requests for a total of 450 brochures. Seeds of truth have been planted, and we hope that parents will be able to follow up on the interest teachers may show when their children return to school in the fall.”​—B. L., Norcross, Georgia.

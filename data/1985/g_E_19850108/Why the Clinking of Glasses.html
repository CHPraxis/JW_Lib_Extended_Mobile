<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you ever noticed people at parties or in restaurants clinking their beverage glasses before taking a drink? If you asked them why they did this, most of them could not give you an answer. Or they may feel it is a harmless act among friends.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, they may be surprised to learn that it is an ancient superstitious custom. According to the American Library Association, thousands of years ago people had the ridiculous notion that when they took a drink the Devil could enter their bodies through their open mouth. And they actually believed that this evil spirit could be frightened by noise. So to avoid this danger they noisily banged their goblets. In Europe, drinkers still bash their beer steins or make the sign of the cross. And some primitive people, including certain Africans, will ring bells before downing their drinks.</p>

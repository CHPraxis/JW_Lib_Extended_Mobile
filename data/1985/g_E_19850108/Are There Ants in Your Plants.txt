Are There Ants in Your Plants?
Many people think that ants are a pestiferous menace to plants that may grow in one’s home or garden. However, the findings of Dr. David Inouye of the University of Maryland offer some rather interesting sidelights about the activities of these little creatures. It appears that ants scamper up and down the stems of plants because they relish dining on their floral nectar. Furthermore, because they are of a militaristic nature, they will aggressively chase away other insects who may dare to encroach on their staked-out territory with its sweet treasure. Thus ants are really good, natural protectors against many destructive insects that seek to devour more of the plant than merely its nectar.

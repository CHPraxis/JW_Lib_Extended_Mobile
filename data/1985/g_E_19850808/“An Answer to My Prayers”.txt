“An Answer to My Prayers”
That is what an appreciative reader said regarding the publication You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth:
“It is simple enough for the children to grasp the truth and intelligent enough for the parents to make their decision. It is concise and to the point. It does not beat around the bush! It expresses the ‘Truth’ as it truthfully is. It fills in all the fine points necessary for reaching the hearts of honest-hearted individuals. . . . Thank you for this ‘red bombshell’ that explodes with life-sustaining truths!”
You, too, will be excited when you open this easy-to-read book designed for Bible study. In its 256 pages, which are the same size as this magazine but with larger type, it contains some 150 beautiful illustrations. These serve as excellent teaching aids that help impress important points on the mind of the reader. Receive your copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

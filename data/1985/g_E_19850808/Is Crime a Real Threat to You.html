<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Have you ever been mugged, or do you know someone who has?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Are you afraid to go out on the streets once the sun has set? Or if you do, do you take precautions?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">Do you avoid taking the subway or public transport at certain times of the day? If you have young children, do you warn them about talking to strangers?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">Are you worried that your children might be attacked at school?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa">Do you have more than one lock on your door? Do you have a burglar alarm or a special locking device on your car? Do you lock your bicycle if you park it out on the street?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sa">If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you perceive crime as a real threat to you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">IN RECENT years people have become more aware of crime. Why? Because it has affected their neighborhood, their friends, their family, themselves. As <em>The New York Times </em>headlined it, “Fear of Crime Is Now Woven Into the Fabric of City Lives.” The article went on to say: “For New York City residents, wealthy as well as poor, crime is no longer something that happens to other people. It pervades the city, and it has forced changes​—some subtle, some dramatic—​in the way people live their lives.” And that applies not only to New York but to many other cities around the world.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">INDIA: Crime is by no means just an American problem. It is a world plague. For example, the magazine <em>India Today </em>spoke of the northern state of Bihar as a “Kidnappers’ Kingdom.” Said a brother of one kidnapping victim: “There is total terror. We have stopped coming out of our houses after sundown. We live under constant fear.” Another press headline was, “Organized Crime a Growth Industry in India.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">ITALY: Italy has its crime problems too​—and not just with the Mafia. There is also <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>“the Camorra, a criminal empire founded over a century ago along the lines of the Sicilian Mafia, a state within a state,” according to <em>The Washington Post. </em>This criminal society “is believed to have been responsible for nearly 1,000 murders over the past three years,” says the same source.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">JAPAN: Crime is a cause for concern in Japanese society. One paper recently reported that Japan has 2,330 crime groups known to the police, with a total of nearly 100,000 gangsters.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">CHINA: The government has taken drastic measures in an effort to cut back on its own “mounting crime problem,” according to the <em>Far Eastern Economic Review. </em>Murderers and rapists are sometimes executed publicly, and other criminals are paraded through the streets with placards hanging from their necks announcing their names and their crimes.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">BRAZIL: A poll taken in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro indicates that 65 percent of the population deliberately avoid areas known to be dangerous; 85 percent no longer wear jewels or carry valuables when they leave home. Over 90 percent of those polled believe they could be attacked at any time.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">NIGERIA: Crime is also a part of life in African countries. Writing in the <em>New Nigerian, </em>correspondent A. Adamu explained: “Burglary, armed-robbery, arson, murder and mayhem, the hideous cruelty with which these are carried out in this country today leave one dumb-struck and at a loss for how best to describe the state of terror and frenzy crime has created on the popular mind.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The truth is, fear of crime stalks most major cities. This widespread perception of crime inhibits the law-abiding segment of society. And people are tired of being intimidated and of having inadequate protection. So when a citizen strikes back against the criminals, he receives an initial ground swell of sympathy.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">But why do so many people turn to crime? Could it be that, contrary to the old saying, crime <em>does </em>indeed pay?</p>

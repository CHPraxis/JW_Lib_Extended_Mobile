“The Best Magazine a Man Can Stay With”
That is what a person from Ghana, West Africa, wrote about the Awake! magazine. He explained:
“It gives good advice about making decisions. It develops one’s spiritual link with his Creator. It informs us about so many things we don’t know. It gives practical suggestions about keeping healthy, exposing hazards and dangers of drinking and smoking. Awake! to me is the best magazine a man can stay with.”
Awake! is for the enlightenment of the entire family. You, too, can benefit from this magazine, published in 54 languages and read by millions of people.
Please send a year’s subscription for Awake! I enclose $4 (U.S.) for 24 issues of this magazine (2 copies a month).

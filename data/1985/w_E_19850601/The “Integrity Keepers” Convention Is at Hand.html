<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A rewarding four days of Bible instruction awaits you at the “Integrity Keepers” Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses beginning this month. By means of instructive discourses, interviews with experienced ministers, and practical demonstrations, vital Christian guidance will be provided.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Be there for the opening session at 1:30 Thursday afternoon. The chairman’s address, “Let Integrity Safeguard Us,” highlights the convention theme and will whet anticipation for the whole four-day program. Also, in the opening session you will receive what will prove to be long-lasting assistance to reason with others from the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On Friday morning, there will be the dramatic presentation <em>Your Future​—A Challenge. </em>This will be a real encouragement to young ones. No doubt you will appreciate so much what you receive on Friday that you will be eager to share it with others in the community.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Saturday’s program is filled with practical instruction for Christian living. What it means to keep your eye simple and how a checkup can be made of your figurative heart will be explained. The day’s concluding presentation, “Integrity to Truth in a Godless World,” will provide you with something beautiful that not only will be a treasure to you but also should make a tremendous impact on our activity in the field ministry.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The program on Sunday, the final day, will highlight the full-costume dramatic presentation <em>Fear God, Turn Away From Bad, </em>as well as the public talk, “God’s Times and Seasons​—To What Do They Point?” Truly an instructive, thrilling four-day program! BE THERE!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Since over a hundred conventions are scheduled in the United States alone, there will be a convention not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest you.</p>

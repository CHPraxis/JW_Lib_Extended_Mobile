<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Our goal in this wicked “time of the end” is to be able to say, as did faithful King David, “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity,” and “as for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:1-19:26:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:11-19:26:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Truly this quality is vitally necessary now in view of the critical times in which we are living. What a joy it is to know that integrity keepers have the assurance of Jehovah’s help and protection during this time as promised at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:7</a>, “For those walking in integrity he is a shield.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:9-20:10:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:32-20:14:32" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14:32</a>.) In view of this, how can we individually resolve to build and also walk in our integrity in practical ways so that we can say as did Job, “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself”?(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) One excellent provision to assist us in maintaining our integrity is our forthcoming 1985 “Integrity Keepers” Convention. Last summer there was an all-time peak attendance of 1,159,898 in the contiguous United States. What a blessing it will be this summer to be in attendance with even more of our brothers and sisters at well over 100 conventions in this country.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>By now your congregation has received a letter from the Society, dated December 10, 1984, informing you of the convention you are assigned to attend. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats and food for everyone. To assist you in making the necessary arrangements, the information that follows is being provided. As you make your plans to be in attendance, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so they can attend every session as well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the hotel or motel by using the information provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay a great deal less than the regular rates charged by the hotel or motel, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms. These rooms will be assigned by the hotel or motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses, or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. By the middle of December 1984 your congregation should have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It shows the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates, and the phone number to be used in making your reservations.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </strong>As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels that the convention organization provides, you should IMMEDIATELY phone the hotel or motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s DEPOSIT will be required at all locations to hold the room, and the deposit should be sent directly to the hotel or motel <em>as soon as </em>you make your reservations. Do not make rooming arrangements you do not intend to keep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>) <em>Motels or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date without a deposit. </em>If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations, you should write or phone the hotel or motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available for other delegates <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>who need accommodations. The convention Rooming Department will monitor the arrangement and, through the congregation, will provide additional information such as which hotels or motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel or motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>DORMITORIES: </strong>A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel or motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>SPECIAL NEEDS: </strong>Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf, or others. Also, they may care for such ones in other ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:15-59:2:17" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:17, 18</a>) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all who need our help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:11-47:6:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 13:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Gal. 6:10</a>) However, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who are unable to care for themselves, or cannot be cared for by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though the convention coordinator forwards the form to the convention Rooming Department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodations by the Rooming Department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those who have limited funds and who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper for delegates to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days so they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period only.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </strong>To reduce travel, district conventions are arranged at many locations. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest to your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if for some reason you will be attending a location other than the one assigned, you may ask the convention coordinator in your congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where you will attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless persons have special needs, they should <em>not </em>use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>the hotel or motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels and motels, they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><strong>YOUR COOPERATION NEEDED: </strong>The smoothness and the success with which this rooming arrangement functions depend largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention Rooming Department, it can cause a major breakdown in negotiations. The same is true if a number of delegates choose to make their own arrangements with facilities not listed because they have not cooperated with the convention rooming arrangement. As an example, a motel across the street from the convention site may not lower its rates, possibly even raising them for the convention, and so the convention Rooming Department advises the motel management that the motel will not be put on the list and thus will not get our business. However, if brothers go ahead and accept these higher rates and fill this motel, even though it is not listed, then that motel may never lower its rates. In turn, the management of other motels or hotels may be encouraged to hold out for higher prices. The conventions are working to save all our brothers as much expense as possible, and so it is in the best interest of all for everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels or motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>SIGN LANGUAGE SESSIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>As shown in the accompanying chart, sign language translation will be provided <em>only </em>at 16 specific convention cities. (<em>No </em>provision will be made at any other conventions for sign language.) We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers can do much to let the deaf in their congregation know of the arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made by the Society.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>TAPE RECORDINGS</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>No provision will be made by the Society for recording the program or the dramas either on audio or on video tape. Any individuals who make personal recordings for their own use should do so in such a way that it will not disturb or distract others in attendance.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">[NOTE TO THE BODY OF ELDERS: Upon receipt of the Society’s convention assignment letter for your congregation, dated December 10, 1984, <em>and </em>the Recommended Lodging Locations list from the district convention committee, please immediately read the letter at the next two meetings. Thereafter, please be sure to post the letter as well as the Recommended Lodging Locations list on the information board, leaving them there until the convention. Thus everyone will receive the information at the same time.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">The elder serving as the convention coordinator should conduct the Service Meeting parts covering this insert as scheduled, as well as handle other convention material and announcements on the meetings. When covering this insert, please read all cited scriptures and any paragraphs that have particular application to your congregation. All elders will want to cooperate fully and offer suggestions to ensure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material.]</p>

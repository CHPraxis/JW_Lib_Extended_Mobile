Be Stabilized in the Faith
1 As insecurity increases in the world around us, it is urgent that we become and remain stabilized in the faith. (Isa. 57:20, 21; 1 John 5:4) Accordingly, it is most fitting that the circuit assembly program beginning in February 1985 will develop the theme “Be Stabilized in the Faith.”​—Col. 2:7.
2 This new program will highlight the need for all to become steadfast, mature Christians. It will help us appreciate just what is required to maintain balance as Christians living in the midst of the world but being no part of it. (John 17:14) None of us can afford to miss this pointed and practical program.​—Matt. 24:45.
3 Begin early to make your plans to attend. As soon as the dates and location for your assembly are announced, arrange your affairs so that you can be present both days. Encourage Bible students to come with you. Everyone attending is sure to be rewarded spiritually and strengthened to stand “solid in the faith.”​—1 Pet. 5:9.

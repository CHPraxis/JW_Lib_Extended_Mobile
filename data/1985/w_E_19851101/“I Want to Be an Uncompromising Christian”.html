<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After reading a book entitled <em>“Let Your Kingdom Come,” </em>published by the Watchtower Society, a young man in Zimbabwe was moved to write the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have been observing over the past few years that here in Zimbabwe it is you people, Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are really trying to follow Christ’s own example. I am a Seventh Day Adventist member, but it seems as if my Church in this country has lost the inspiration of the holy spirit. We are compromising with the world. For example, we believe, just as you do, that Christ was not born on the 25th [of] December, and yet our pastors tell us that we can celebrate Christmas as long as we keep in mind that Christ died for our sins. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Personally, I am sick and tired of professing to be a Christian while my way of life is contrary to Jesus’ example. I want to be an uncompromising Christian . . . You are the only group, so far, that has managed to convince me of God’s love and the power of His gospel, through your living and not only through speeches and writings. You are living and preaching the gospel while many, many people are preaching the gospel but not living it.”</p>

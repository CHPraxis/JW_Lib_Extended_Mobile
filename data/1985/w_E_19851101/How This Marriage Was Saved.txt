How This Marriage Was Saved
“The application of the counsel in the book Making Your Family Life Happy saved my marriage,” wrote an appreciative reader from South Africa. “Chapter five, ‘A Wife Who Is Dearly Loved,’ opened my eyes. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I could unwittingly cause so many problems. Thank you very, very much. My marriage had been in most stormy parts of the sea, and now, after months, it is back in the quiet harbour of happiness.”

“I Was Full of a Warm Feeling”
Burt lives in England. He spent six weeks in Australia, visiting his brother Eric and his wife who are Jehovah’s Witnesses. Being of a different religion, Burt hesitated when his brother invited him to attend a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. But he was so surprised by the warm, friendly spirit with which he was greeted that, after his return to England, he wrote this letter of appreciation to the congregation:
“I must admit that I am not a Witness, being an active member of the Church of England, so it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I accompanied Eric and Joan to their Sunday worship.
“I need not have had any fears whatever. The welcome I received from almost the whole congregation was not only most brotherly and sincere but I was full of a warm feeling that, although a complete stranger, I was accepted, not so much as a visitor but as a welcome member of the congregation.
“While I did not fully understand your service and witness, I nevertheless took my leave at the end of the meeting feeling that I had benefited greatly from the experience and wondering why the love and sincerity that was evident during the whole service could not spread across this very troubled world of ours.
Yours very sincerely,
Burt B.”

“The Watchtower” Steps Into Simultaneous Publication
In July 1879 the first issue of this magazine stated: “As its name indicates, it aims to be the lookout from whence matters of interest and profit may be announced to the ‘little flock.’” Today, The Watchtower serves spiritual food also to “a great crowd” of sincere persons who look forward to gaining everlasting life here on earth.​—Luke 12:32; Revelation 7:9-17.
As the circulation of The Watchtower increased so did the number of languages in which it appeared. Today, these languages total 102. Reports show that new subscriptions to The Watchtower and its companion magazine, Awake!, have increased remarkably over the past 70 years. So also has the field placement of individual copies. Here are some available figures:
Year   New Subscriptions   Magazines Placed
1914        2,746                 95,973
1944      292,258              9,293,913
1964    1,551,436            127,055,165
1984    1,812,221            287,358,064
Now we reach another milestone in the 105-year history of The Watchtower​—its simultaneous publication in 20-and-more languages. A joyful development indeed! May Jehovah continue to use this magazine mightily in announcing his Kingdom by Christ Jesus!

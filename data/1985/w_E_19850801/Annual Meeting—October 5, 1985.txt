Annual Meeting​—October 5, 1985
THE ANNUAL MEETING of the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania on October 5, 1985, will be held at the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 973 Flatbush Avenue in the Borough of Brooklyn, New York City. A preliminary meeting of the members only will be held at 9:30 a.m., followed by the general annual meeting at 10:00 a.m., Saturday, October 5, 1985.
It will be appreciated if the members of the Corporation will inform the Secretary’s Office of any change in their mailing addresses during the past year so that the regular letters of notice and proxies can reach them shortly after August 15.
The proxies, which will be sent to the members along with the notice of the annual meeting, are to be returned so as to reach the Office of the Secretary of the Society not later than September 1. As each member knows, he should complete and return his proxy promptly, stating whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not. The information given on each proxy should be definite on this point, as it will be relied upon in determining in advance those who will actually be personally present.
It is expected that the entire session, including the formal business meeting and reports, will be concluded by 1:00 p.m. or shortly thereafter. There will be no afternoon session. Due to limited space, admission will be by ticket only. No arrangements will be made for tying in the annual meeting by telephone lines to other locations.

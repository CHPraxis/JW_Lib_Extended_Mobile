A Valuable Research Tool
“Thank you for the Watchtower and Awake! volumes,” writes a 13-​year-​old from New Zealand. She explains:
“My teacher asked the class to do research on any disaster and then put it into booklet form. I chose to study about the Titanic. I looked for books at school but couldn’t find anything suitable. So I looked in the 1981 Awake! volume. I read the whole article about the Titanic, and then in my own words, I put it in booklet form. When my teacher had marked all the assignments, he showed mine to the class. I got the highest mark.” She concludes: “Anytime I have an assignment, I will use your publications.”

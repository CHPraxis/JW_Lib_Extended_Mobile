The Red Charmer With a Cheerful Song
Have you ever been awakened by a red charmer with a cheerful song? If you live in North America, that may be your happy exit from slumber because one of the most popular songbirds​—the cardinal—​makes his nest in that part of the world. The male cardinal stakes out his territory with a clear whistle. And can he be a persistent and accomplished singer! “One male cardinal was recorded as having 28 songs made up of different combinations of syllables,” says The International Wildlife Encyclopedia.
This beautiful bird is about eight inches [20 cm] long, decked out in bright red feathers with a distinctive black “bib” around his bill. However, the female wears a coat of dull brown plumage. She belongs to one of the comparatively few species whose females can sing.
No matter where you live, next time you hear the lilting tune of a songbird, thank your heavenly Creator for his remarkable wisdom and ability. Songbirds are one of his gifts of color and cheer.​—Psalm 148:7-10.

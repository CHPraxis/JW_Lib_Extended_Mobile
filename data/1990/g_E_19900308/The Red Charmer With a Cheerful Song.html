<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you ever been awakened by a red charmer with a cheerful song? If you live in North America, that may be your happy exit from slumber because one of the most popular songbirds​—the cardinal—​makes his nest in that part of the world. The male cardinal stakes out his territory with a clear whistle. And can he be a persistent and accomplished singer! “One male cardinal was recorded as having 28 songs made up of different combinations of syllables,” says <em>The International Wildlife Encyclopedia.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This beautiful bird is about eight inches <strong>[20 cm] </strong>long, decked out in bright red feathers with a distinctive black “bib” around his bill. However, the female wears a coat of dull brown plumage. She belongs to one of the comparatively few species whose females can sing.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No matter where you live, next time you hear the lilting tune of a songbird, thank your heavenly Creator for his remarkable wisdom and ability. Songbirds are one of his gifts of color and cheer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:7-19:148:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 148:7-10</a>.</p>

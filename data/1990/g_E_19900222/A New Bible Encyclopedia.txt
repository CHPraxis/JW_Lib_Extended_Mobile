A New Bible Encyclopedia
Many have been writing to express their appreciation for the new Bible encyclopedia that they have received. “What a wonderful aid to research the two new volumes Insight on the Scriptures!” enthuses a writer from Wisconsin, U.S.A. “It is indeed a wonderful gift, one that I shall forever cherish and endeavor to use to the full,” writes a woman from Jamaica, West Indies.
The two volumes of Insight on the Scriptures contain a total of 2,560 pages in clear, readable type. Its thousands of articles are alphabetically arranged and comprehensive. They deal with people, places, plant and animal life, notable events, figurative expressions in the Bible, and the record of God’s dealings with humankind.
Fifty-three subjects are developed as special features in full color. Many of these include maps and photographs of geographical locations and museum displays, as well as other artwork designed to help you to visualize Bible accounts. Valuable background and explanatory material is provided on upwards of 3,500 Bible texts. Subject, scripture, and map-​location indexes are included.

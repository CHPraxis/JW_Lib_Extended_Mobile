Do Not Miss the “Pure Language” District Convention!
Four rewarding days of Bible instruction await you. Be present when the program begins at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. Enjoy the thought-provoking talk “Are Your Friends Jehovah’s Friends?” as well as the keynote address, “A Pure Language for All Nations.” The afternoon’s concluding talk, “Saving Your Life With Blood​—How?,” will answer the question: Is blood really needed to save life?
Friday morning’s session begins at 9:30. Be there to benefit from the probing talk “Christ ‘Hated Lawlessness’​—Do You?” and the motivating discourse “Reject Worldly Fantasies, Pursue Kingdom Realities.” During the afternoon, practical suggestions on ways to live within your financial means will be provided. Parents will be shown how they can more effectively fulfill their obligations, and a modern-day drama will offer youths excellent guidance regarding participation in extracurricular school activities.
Saturday morning’s session will feature the discourse on dedication and baptism, as well as consider the need to make sacrifices in order to do personal Bible study. “Jehovah’s Celestial Chariot on the Move” is a stirring talk on the afternoon’s program. Also, there will be strong reminders regarding our Christian responsibility to aid those blinded by false religion, and practical assistance will be offered to fulfill this responsibility.
You will want to be present Sunday morning to hear the powerful message that will be delivered against Christendom and its clergy. This will be followed by a full-costume dramatic presentation based on events involving the lives of Jehu and Jonadab. Then, in the afternoon, be sure to hear the public talk, “Become United by the Pure Language.”
During June, July, and August, more than 140 conventions are scheduled throughout the United States alone, so there will be one not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest to you.

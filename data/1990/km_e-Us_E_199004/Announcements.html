<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● District convention badge cards for 1990 in English and Spanish will be consigned to congregations and included with April literature shipments. It will not be necessary to order these. Based on the size of each congregation, consignments in lots of 25 will be made. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be ordered on a Literature Order form (S-14). It is necessary to order plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation that desire them. The holders are available from the Society.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Starting with the week of June 18, 1990, and continuing through the week of September 17, the brochure <em>Should You Believe in the Trinity? </em>will be considered at the Congregation Book Study. Questions to be used for this study will be published as an insert to the June 1990 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>This detailed consideration of the <em>Trinity </em>brochure will require careful preparation on the part of the book study conductor and all who attend. Being present each week at the Congregation Book Study will help equip us to use this brochure more effectively in the field service.</p>

Comfort During Times of Distress
Receive Cassettes of the Bible in Handy Albums
“I’d like to express my heartfelt thanks for making the Bible tapes available,” writes a woman from Rome, New York. “My husband has brain cancer and can no longer read. The tapes will be a gift for our anniversary September 26 (7 years). This is the best gift I could think of. I’ll find comfort that ‘even though the man he is outside is wasting away, the man he is inside is being renewed day to day’ through God’s Word and promises.”​—2 Corinthians 4:16.

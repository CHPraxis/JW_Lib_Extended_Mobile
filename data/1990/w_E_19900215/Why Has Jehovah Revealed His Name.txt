Why Has Jehovah Revealed His Name?
A commentary of the “Old Testament” published in Poland in 1964 answered this question in a very thought-provoking way. Under the imprimatur of the Roman Catholic Church, Dr. Stanisław Łach, professor at Lublin University, noted:
“Redeemed people are responsible for God’s name before mankind.” It was the responsibility of the Israelites to make efforts so “that the Gentiles bless the name of Jahwe [Jehovah] and that they do not blaspheme” it. “Jahwe has a meaning . . . The world will be judged depending on the reaction to those who confess that name.” The professor declared that “the name Jahwe will be great among the nations . . . It will spread all over the world. Such was the destiny of . . . that name to Moses.”
Yes, as Malachi 1:11 prophesies: “‘My name will be great among the nations,’ Jehovah of armies has said.” And who today are declaring that name worldwide so that “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved”? Jehovah’s Witnesses! The public’s reaction to these “people for his name,” yes, “those who confess that name,” is a matter of life and death to them. What is your reaction to Jehovah and his Witnesses?​—Acts 2:21; 15:14; compare Malachi 3:16-18.

Come to the “Pure Language” District Convention
DIFFERENCES in language have been a divisive force ever since Babel. There Jehovah confused mankind’s language and frustrated the people’s purpose to ‘build a tower and make a celebrated name for themselves.’ (Genesis 11:4) How divisive a difference in language can be is seen in what took place in Belgium. Several years ago, the Catholic University at Louvain was split in half linguistically.
Language is only one of the reasons for divisions among men. Others are nationality, race, education, and economic level. But Jehovah’s Witnesses have worked to overcome all these divisive factors and are truly united.
Last summer saw a most striking display of this unity in the cities of Chorzów (near Katowice), Poznan, and Warsaw in Poland. Witnesses, speaking at least 20 different languages, were present from some 37 lands. Yet, a striking oneness was manifested by all. What accounted for this? All spoke the “pure language” of Scriptural truth. This was prophetically foretold at Zephaniah 3:9: “Then I [Jehovah God] shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”
With good reason, therefore, the 1990 district conventions will have the theme “Pure Language.” Because of human imperfection, influences from Satan’s wicked world, and the crafty acts of the Devil and his demons, speaking the “pure language” does not always come easy. We must always be on guard against selfish tendencies that could divide us.
Why has God given us this pure language? So that we can serve Jehovah “shoulder to shoulder.” Other translations indicate that this means to serve God “under the same yoke” (The Jerusalem Bible); “with one consent” (Moffatt); “with one accord” (An American Translation); and to “cooperate in his service.”​—Byington.
By means of talks, demonstrations, experiences, symposiums, and Bible dramas at these conventions, we will be encouraged and stimulated to speak the pure language more fluently. They will also move us to serve with our brothers more effectively and harmoniously.
These conventions will begin on Thursday shortly after 1:00 p.m. and will conclude at about 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. Make plans now to be on hand for the opening song and to attend all sessions until the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon.
Come with your Bibles and songbooks, and be prepared to take notes. Come also with a good spiritual appetite, and you will leave more fully equipped to speak the pure language and to serve Jehovah.

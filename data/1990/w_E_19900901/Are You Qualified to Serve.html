To disqualify a man from serving in the congregation, a charge must not be frivolous, and it must be proved in harmony with Scriptural standards.

Yet, the person must act as an older man in a spiritual sense. Ministerial servants and elders should be old enough to have children. If married, a man does not qualify if he acts in a godly way elsewhere but is a tyrant at home. He must have earned respect for presiding over his household according to Bible principles, and his objective should be to have spiritual success with every family member. As a general rule, an elder who is a father should have well-behaved minor children who are <em>“believing.” </em>Either they are progressing toward dedication to God or they are already baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses. A man unable to build faith in his children is unlikely to do so in others.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:6-47:11:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>) He must qualify to impart “healthful teaching” that helps families and individuals to pursue godly lives.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:1-56:2:10" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Titus 2:1-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">21. (a) Why can it be said that an elder is not a smiter? (b) What does it mean to be reasonable? (c) Not being belligerent means what?</p>

(The preceding comment that he is “not a drunken brawler” shows that he avoids alcohol abuse that so often leads to strife.) Being “reasonable” (or, “yielding”), not authoritarian and hard to please, he does not make issues of minor matters.

An elder must not be dogmatic but should take a humble view of his abilities. Not thinking he handles things better than anyone else, he humbly shares responsibility with others and values a multitude of counselors.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:26-4:11:29" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Numbers 11:26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:14-20:11:14" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> Proverbs 11:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="59-3" class="b"> Romans 12:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:16-45:12:16" data-bid="59-4" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

A lover of goodness loves what is good in Jehovah’s sight, performs kind and helpful deeds, and shows appreciation for the goodness of others.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Will You Learn From the Seasons?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JEHOVAH once said: ‘All the days the earth continues, seed sowing and harvest, summer and winter, will never cease.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:22-1:8:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 8:22</a>) He thus stressed the agricultural seasons.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What do you know of the seasons and their relation to farming? Even if you live in a city or do no farming, you should learn of Israel’s seasons and agricultural activities. Why? Because the more you know about these, the better you will understand God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Farmers plow the ground, sow seed, and then harvest and thresh their crops. But to grasp more clearly what the Bible says, we should know more, including <em>when </em>those activities occurred. Take as an example plowing, such as we see being done above on terraced land in what was ancient Judea.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> In what month do you think this picture was taken? Knowing when plowing is done in your land may mislead you. The time for plowing is not the same in the Northern Hemisphere as in the Southern Hemisphere; it differs also at various altitudes and according to the time of the rainy season.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This may affect how you view Bible events. You may read of Elijah’s appointing of his successor: “He . . . found Elisha the son of Shaphat while he was plowing with twelve spans before him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:19-11:19:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 19:19</a>) In what month do you think that occurred, and how would the land have looked? And at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:35-43:4:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:35</a>, Jesus said: “Do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? . . . Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” Though he specified a time, do you understand when?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The chart provides an excellent summary of seasons and agricultural activities in the Promised Land. The outer ring gives the months of the Jewish sacred calendar.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Comparing these with our months, you note the overlap, such as Nisan (or, Abib) overlapping late March and early April. The next portion toward the center shows when crops ripened, which helps you to realize when certain farming activities, such as harvesting and threshing, took place. The center of the chart lets you compare the weather changes during the year.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Use the chart to deepen your understanding and appreciation of Biblical accounts, such as the two examples already mentioned.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Elisha was taking part in a major plowing operation when he was called as a prophet. That likely places the time in Tishri (September-October), when the extreme heat of the summer was past. The early rains had begun to soften the soil, making it possible to do plowing, followed by sowing.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">And when did Jesus say the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:35-43:4:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 4:35</a>? The harvest was four months away. Note that the barley <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>harvest began in Nisan (March-April), about Passover time. Count back four months. That brings you to Chislev (November-December). The rains were increasing, with stronger rains and colder weather ahead. So Jesus clearly meant a figurative harvesting when he said: “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they <em>are </em>white for harvesting.”</p>

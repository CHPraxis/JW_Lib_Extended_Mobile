Used in Teaching Class
The book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? was used in a California school. An 11-year-old explains how. “I was looking through the Creation book,” she writes, “and I noticed that there were a few chapters on the universe and the stars. At the time my teacher had been teaching us astronomy.
“So I wrote down on a piece of paper the chapters he might enjoy reading, and I gave it to him along with the book. He didn’t say anything for a couple of months. Then he started teaching us about the big bang theory. He said that he had been studying a certain book. He went to his desk and pulled out Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? I was so surprised!
“He said that it was the best book he ever read. Then he opened the book and showed the class the pictures. I noticed that he had every single question in the book answered and highlighted. When he was teaching us, he would open the book, read the paragraph, and then explain it. When it came time for the test, the questions were right out of the book. So it was easy for me to study for the test. . . . I got an A.”

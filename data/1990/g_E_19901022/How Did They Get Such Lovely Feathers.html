<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LILAC-BREASTED ROLLERS are common residents of central and southern Africa. They often perch on trees or telephone wires alongside the road. This gives them a good vantage point from which to scan their surroundings for insects and other food.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you travel through Botswana or Zimbabwe, you may see a streak of bright blue feathers as one of these birds flies across the road. As the name roller indicates, they sometimes show off their colorful feathers in a tumbling aerobatic display. The accompanying picture of the bird and the inset of its wing reveals the roller’s vibrant colors. The wing feathers are a blend of four shades of blue together with black and brown. How well this contrasts with the lilac breast, orange cheeks, white forehead, and light-green crown! This raises an important question: How did they get such lovely feathers?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you examine the roller’s feet, you will notice that they are covered with scales, not feathers. Did their feathers develop by chance from the scales of a reptile, as evolutionists teach?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Well, consider that a feather is an engineering marvel. Spreading from the shaft of a feather are rows of barbs. “Should two adjoining barbs become separated​—and considerable force is needed to pull the vane apart—​they are instantly zipped together again by drawing the feather through the fingertips,” explains the science textbook <em>Integrated Principles of Zoology. </em>“The bird, of course, does this with its bill.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Could the hundreds of efficient “zippers” that make up a single feather have arisen by chance? Do scientists have any evidence that a scale actually developed into a feather? “Strangely enough,” admits the above-quoted book, “although modern birds possess both scales (especially on their feet) and feathers, no intermediate stage between the two has been discovered on either fossil or living forms.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Surely, feathers bear testimony to a Master Engineer who is also an expert at blending lovely colors. Creatures such as the lilac-breasted roller are included among the “winged birds” that “praise the name of Jehovah,” the true God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:7-19:148:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 148:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:10-19:148:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10-13</a>.</p>

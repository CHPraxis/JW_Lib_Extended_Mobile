Why Does God Permit Suffering?
Bad news is a fact of life, but why is it so prevalent? Why is there so much suffering? How can its existence be reconciled with belief in a loving God? Will suffering ever end?
The answers to these and other important questions are found in the Bible. The answers involve you and your family. They involve your happiness. You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth is a book that gives hope by pointing you to the Bible’s answers.
The book’s 256 pages, the same size as this magazine, are filled with over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon below.
I would like to receive the 256-page hardcover book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)

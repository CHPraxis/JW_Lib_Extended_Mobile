For decades Jehovah’s organization has encouraged family heads to conduct a regular Bible study with family members. Where this has been done, the benefits have been many. Such study has contributed to a spirit of love and peace within the family circle. Children have progressed to the point of becoming dedicated servants of Jehovah, have exerted a positive influence on the local congregation, and often have entered full-time service. This has brought great joy to Christian parents and others who have watched the progress made.</p>

Their discussion is an informal interchange of comments, not question-and-answer session. One child in family has asked if he can play ball with neighborhood children. Develop material on pages 64-7 of <em>Young People Ask </em>book. Parent asks searching questions to discern whether child understands and agrees with Scriptural principles involved. Emphasize that close friends do not have to be of same age. Select young ones who have read portions of book, and get their observations. Have them point out why material is helpful. Encourage young ones to read book, and stress need for parents to be familiar with its contents so as to include appropriate points in family discussions.</p>

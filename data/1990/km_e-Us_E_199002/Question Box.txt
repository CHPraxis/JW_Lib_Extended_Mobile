● How can we display Christian manners when attending the Congregation Book Study?
We are usually observed by our neighbors, and they will at times comment on and even react to our conduct. (Compare 1 Corinthians 4:9.) As Jehovah’s servants, we want their comments and reactions to our behavior to be favorable. (1 Pet. 2:12) This is true in connection with our activity at the Congregation Book Study. Since the majority of these are held in private homes, special care must be exercised so that our manners reflect well on everything we do. Where parking is limited, why not make arrangements to carpool so as to prevent undue irritation to those in the neighborhood of the book study? Our love for our neighbor will make us refrain from inconsiderately parking our car in a way that could cause him inconvenience or distress.
We are joyful whenever we meet, and this often results in animated conversation before and after the meeting. (Mic. 2:12) Good manners and consideration for others would dictate that the volume of our conversation be kept at a modest level. (Matt. 7:12; Gal. 6:10) Christian love would also impel us to restrain our children from running outside and from damaging other people’s property. (Prov. 29:15; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5) This would include respectful conduct in the home where the book study is conducted. If any improper conduct is observed, the elders should not delay in giving loving and firm counsel so that problems do not arise that could result in complaints from neighbors, difficulties for the householder who has hospitably opened his home for the study, or inconvenience for those attending a particular book study location.

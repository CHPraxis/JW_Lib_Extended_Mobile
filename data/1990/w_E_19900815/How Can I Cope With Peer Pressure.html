<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter from a Chicago police officer illustrates the importance of knowing the answer. He writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“On January 15, 1990, I was processing an 18-year-old prisoner who was brought back to Chicago from Mississippi on a fugitive warrant. Part of the processing is to take all the prisoner’s property. He had in his possession a <em>Young People Ask </em>book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“‘Did you read this book?’ I asked.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘while I was hiding in Mississippi, I worked on a farm, and two of Jehovah’s Witnesses gave me this book.’ Then he started to cry, almost sobbing uncontrollably. Between sobs, he said: ‘I’ve read this book many times, and the chapter I keep reading over and over is “How Can I Cope with Peer Pressure?”’ He added: ‘If I had only had this information three or four years ago, I would not be here today.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The prisoner was led away, and I read the police report and the confession he gave to the police. In it he said: ‘The leader of my gang told me to go down the street and shoot a rival gang member who was selling cocaine in our territory. I did what I was told. I feared the other members would think I’m not cool. I wanted to be accepted.’”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Perhaps you too have asked yourself such questions as: How can I cope with peer pressure? Should I quit school? How can I say no to premarital sex? Why say <em>no </em>to drugs?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a youth from Maryland, U.S.A., writes regarding the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>“I read the whole book in two days,” she says, “and couldn’t stop telling people about it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I found that chapter 6, ‘Why Are My Brother and Sister So Hard to Get Along With?,’ helped me because at times I feel kind of jealous of my older sister. But I was quick to realize by reading that I shouldn’t feel jealous because she had certain rights that I didn’t have. When an argument seemed to be coming, I applied the counsel in the book. It worked! Now a stronger relationship is building between my sister and me.”</p>

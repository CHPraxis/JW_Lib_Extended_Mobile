‘Counsel in the Book Worked’
That is what a youth from Maryland, U.S.A., writes regarding the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. “I read the whole book in two days,” she says, “and couldn’t stop telling people about it.
“I found that chapter 6, ‘Why Are My Brother and Sister So Hard to Get Along With?,’ helped me because at times I feel kind of jealous of my older sister. But I was quick to realize by reading that I shouldn’t feel jealous because she had certain rights that I didn’t have. When an argument seemed to be coming, I applied the counsel in the book. It worked! Now a stronger relationship is building between my sister and me.”
Growing up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should I drink? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? Youths need answers that work. We feel that you and your children will benefit greatly from this attractively illustrated, 320-page publication.

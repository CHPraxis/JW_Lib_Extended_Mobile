<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Without realizing it, some humans make idols of themselves. The Bible explains at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:5</a>: “For you know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no fornicator or unclean person or greedy person​—<em>which means being an idolater</em>—​has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.) Fleshly desires can come between a person and God. Paul says of such that “their god is their belly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:18-50:3:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 3:18, 19</a>) In other words, they have another “god” apart from Jehovah, putting first their own fleshly desires. Such conduct can exclude a person from God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) There is good reason, then, to heed the words of the apostle Paul: “Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>.</p>

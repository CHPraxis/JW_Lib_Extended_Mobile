Are You Your Own Idol?
Without realizing it, some humans make idols of themselves. The Bible explains at Ephesians 5:5: “For you know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no fornicator or unclean person or greedy person​—which means being an idolater—​has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.” (Colossians 3:5; compare Galatians 5:19-21.) Fleshly desires can come between a person and God. Paul says of such that “their god is their belly.” (Philippians 3:18, 19) In other words, they have another “god” apart from Jehovah, putting first their own fleshly desires. Such conduct can exclude a person from God’s Kingdom. (1 Corinthians 6:9, 10) There is good reason, then, to heed the words of the apostle Paul: “Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.”​—1 Corinthians 10:14.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If you are thinking in terms of the most popular international language, you will probably answer “English” to that question. Yet, according to the 1990 <em>World Almanac and Book of Facts, </em>Mandarin Chinese, spoken by some 844 million people, is the language most used by the human family. This compares with 437 million, spread all over the world, who speak English. Which language do you think would be third in the world league? French or Spanish? No. It is Hindi, spoken by 338 million people, mainly in India. Hindi and Urdu, which is spoken by 90 million, mainly in Pakistan, “are essentially the same language, Hindustani,” according to the same publication.</p>

Foreword
EACH day people face ethical decisions about health: organ transplants, abortion, the “right to die.” Hopefully, you will never face those problems.
Yet, there is one issue that demands your attention: How can blood be used to save life?
With good reason, many now ask, ‘How safe are blood transfusions?’ But this is more than a medical issue. It has made news involving Jehovah’s Witnesses. Have you wondered why these ethical people, who believe in good medicine, refuse to accept blood?
As you will see, the medical and moral aspects of using blood bear directly on how you can save your most valued possession: LIFE.

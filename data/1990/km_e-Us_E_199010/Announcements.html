We are presently accepting requests for the years 1960-1969 ONLY. Future announcements to all congregations will provide instructions for requesting the reprinted bound volumes for other years. Any interested in obtaining the reprinted Spanish <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes for 1960-1969 should request them through the congregation on the next literature request form.

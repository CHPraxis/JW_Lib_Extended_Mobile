<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201990362/">Continue Teaching Without Letup</a>.” Discussion and demonstrations. After considering paragraph 2, have experienced pioneers or publishers demonstrate how to offer a subscription to a person who shows genuine interest in the Kingdom message. If the person would like to receive the magazine(s) regularly, we will be pleased to write up a subscription so he can receive the magazines in the mail. Explain how our work is supported by voluntary donations. If he does not want to make a donation, we can encourage him to benefit from reading the magazines and offer to return and discuss further encouraging Scriptural information. Chairman points out the need to be discerning when offering the subscription. It is not necessary to mention that the magazines can be obtained for a specific period of time, such as one year. A six-month subscription should build the person’s appreciation for the Kingdom message published in the magazine and help us determine if he is truly interested. After paragraphs 3 and 4, have two enthusiastic publishers consider how they are going to apply these suggestions during October and in the coming months.</p>

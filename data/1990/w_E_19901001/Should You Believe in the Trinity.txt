Should You Believe in the Trinity?
Is Jesus Christ the Almighty God?
A person from Hayward, California, writes: “I am amazed, thrilled, and delighted with the above-named brochure. It is a masterly work of accumulating data from various religious sources and quoting admissions that the doctrine of the Trinity is false, misleading, and not supported by God’s Word, the Bible.”
Many have appreciated this scholarly, well-documented examination of this fundamental teaching of most churches of Christendom. If you would like to receive a copy of this brochure, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the 32-page brochure Should You Believe in the Trinity? (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

He Was Fascinated
While riding the New York subway last spring, a young woman was reading the book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! The man sitting next to her noticed the publication, and as she turned the pages, he was fascinated by the striking illustrations. “Oh, that book sure looks interesting!” he said.
“Yes, it is,” the woman responded. “It explains the Bible book of Revelation, chapter by chapter.”
“How can I get one of those?” the man wanted to know.
“From Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she replied. But then she continued: “You know, this copy that I have is new, and it is only $3, so I could let you have it.”
He immediately took the money from his pocket and accepted the book. Just then, the train stopped, and he had to hurry off.
This fascinating hardbound book, the same page size as this magazine, presents a verse-by-verse consideration of the entire Bible book of Revelation. It provides a clear, logical identification of the beasts, the dragon, the great harlot, and the other symbolic features of Revelation. You will see the meaning for our day. Send for it today.
Please send, postpaid, the 320-page book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! I enclose $3 (U.S.).

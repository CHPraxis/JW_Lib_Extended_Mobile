<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While riding the New York subway last spring, a young woman was reading the book <em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em>The man sitting next to her noticed the publication, and as she turned the pages, he was fascinated by the striking illustrations. “Oh, that book sure looks interesting!” he said.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Yes, it is,” the woman responded. “It explains the Bible book of Revelation, chapter by chapter.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“How can I get one of those?” the man wanted to know.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“From Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she replied. But then she continued: “You know, this copy that I have is new, and it is only $3, so I could let you have it.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">He immediately took the money from his pocket and accepted the book. Just then, the train stopped, and he had to hurry off.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This fascinating hardbound book, the same page size as this magazine, presents a verse-by-verse consideration of the entire Bible book of Revelation. It provides a clear, logical identification of the beasts, the dragon, the great harlot, and the other symbolic features of Revelation. You will see the meaning for our day. Send for it today.</p>

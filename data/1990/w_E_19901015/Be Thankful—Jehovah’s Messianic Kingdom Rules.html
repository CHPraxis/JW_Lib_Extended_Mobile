<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb">EARLY in 1911, the president of the Watch Tower Society, C. T. Russell, gave a series of Bible lectures in major cities of Europe. Commenting on that tour, Russell wrote the following in <em>The Watch Tower, </em>May 15, 1911: “We were surprised to find so many evidences of prosperity everywhere . . . Our readers know that for some years we have been expecting this Age to close with an awful time of trouble, and we expect it to break out with suddenness and force not long after October, 1914, which, so far as we can understand the Scriptures, is the date at which the Times of the Gentiles​—the lease of earth’s dominions to the Gentiles—​will expire; the time, therefore, when Messiah’s kingdom will be due to begin its exercise of power.” Was this expectation fulfilled?</p>

But peace was suddenly shattered with the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne by a Serb on June 28, 1914. Austria-Hungary soon declared war against Serbia. Russia took sides with Serbia, so Germany declared war against Russia on August 1. Then Germany declared war against France on August 3; Great Britain against Germany on August 4; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7; Japan against Germany on August 23; Austria-Hungary against Belgium on August 28. Many believed that the war would soon be over. Instead, it escalated into the worst war of history up till that time, with 19 more countries taking sides in an international bloodbath that cost over 13,000,000 military and civilian lives, with over 21,000,000 maimed and wounded.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The expression “Gentile Times,” or “appointed times of the nations,” comes from Jesus’ great prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:5-42:21:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:5-36</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) Two days prior to giving it, Jesus presented himself to the <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>inhabitants of Jerusalem as their Messiah. While he humbly rode upon an ass toward the city, crowds of Jews shouted in triumph, just as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a> foretold. “Blessed is the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name,” they cried aloud.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:28-42:19:40" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 19:28-40</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Divine wrath was certain to come upon the inhabitants of Judea because of their terrible bloodguilt. Jerusalem, with its magnificent temple, could no longer be called “the city of the great King,” Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:35-40:5:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 5:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:33-42:13:35" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 13:33-35</a>) Some days before Jesus’ death, his disciples spoke admiringly of that city’s temple buildings. In response, Jesus predicted: “As for these things that you are beholding, the days will come in which not a stone upon a stone will be left here and not be thrown down.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:5-42:21:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 21:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 8. When Jesus gave “the sign” of events leading up to Jerusalem’s destruction, what else was involved?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jesus’ disciples asked in surprise: “Teacher, when will these things actually be, and what will be the sign when these things are destined to occur?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:7-42:21:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 21:7</a>) In reply Jesus accurately predicted the events that led up to Jerusalem’s destruction, and he added this significant phrase: “Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:8-42:21:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:8-24</a>, <em>KJ</em>) Jesus thus pointed ahead to something beyond Jerusalem’s destruction​—something that had to wait “until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” With reference to “the sign,” Jesus said: “When you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 21:31</a>) Therefore, the sign was to have a dual fulfillment. The first, or small-scale, fulfillment would indicate that ‘the desolating of Jerusalem had drawn near.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 21:20</a>) The second, and larger, fulfillment would come when the Gentile Times had ended, and it would indicate that “the kingdom of God is near.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>By saying <em>“Jerusalem </em>will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled,” was Jesus suggesting that the earthly city would eventually be restored to divine favor? No. After the murder of God’s beloved Son, earthly Jerusalem lost its special status forever and has been replaced by a far superior “city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:23:38" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matthew 23:37, 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:50-40:27:51" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 27:50, 51</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The expression “heavenly Jerusalem” is used in the Bible to describe the indestructible heavenly Kingdom to which anointed Christians have been called.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:10-58:11:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:22" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 12:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 28</a>) When the apostle Paul wrote this, the earthly city with its temple was still very much admired by Jews.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Jerusalem was long the capital of the nation of Israel, whose kings were said to “sit upon Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>) Also, Jehovah made a covenant with David that the kingship would remain in his family forever. Just as modern-day capitals, such as Washington, Moscow, Canberra, and Pretoria, are used to identify their respective governments, so Jerusalem is used in the Bible to represent the Davidic kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:16-10:7:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:32" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Luke 1:32</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>David’s kingdom had a limited domain, extending only to the God-defined boundaries of ancient Israel. Earthly Jerusalem was therefore only a type of the real Messianic Kingdom that would rule from heaven and have the whole earth as its domain.

It involved a tree that was chopped down and allowed to grow again after a period of “seven times.” The dream had an initial fulfillment when Nebuchadnezzar was restored to his throne after a temporary state of madness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:10-27:4:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 4:10-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:28-27:4:36" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 28-36</a>.</p>

The book of Revelation indicated that the establishment of God’s Kingdom would result in a war in heaven. Satan and his demons were to be cast out of heaven and limited to the vicinity of our earth. After seeing this victory in a prophetic vision, John heard a loud voice say: “Be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) Christendom, under the influence of its clergy, continues to reject the Kingdom message. Its preference for human political schemes and its persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses parallel the shocking treatment of Christ by the first-century inhabitants of Judea. Just as Jehovah executed his judgment upon Jerusalem, so he will do to antitypical unfaithful Jerusalem, namely, Christendom. And as the generation that heard Christ’s judgment message lived to experience the destruction he foretold, so the present generation since 1914 “will by no means pass away” before the foretold “great tribulation” comes.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21, 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 34</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>What must we do to survive the great tribulation and live on into God’s new world? Regardless of wrong expectations any of us may have had, we must guard against falling asleep as to our Christian duties.

Thus, we need to be alert; there is no time to lose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42</a>) All who want to survive the end of Satan’s wicked world must act now in a way that shows agreement with the inspired words: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, . . . because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:17-66:11:17" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 11:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Brother F. E. Skinner finished his earthly course of life on July 4, 1990. Edwin Skinner was 96 years old and had served the interests of Jehovah’s Kingdom full-time in India since July 1926. He was baptized in England in 1919. His life story appeared in <em>The Watchtower </em>of January 1, 1990. Brother Skinner was truly a man of faith and endurance in running the course to the finish, and he has surely gained his reward.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:7-55:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>.</p>

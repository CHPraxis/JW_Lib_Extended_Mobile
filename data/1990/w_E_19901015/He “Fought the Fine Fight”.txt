He “Fought the Fine Fight”
Brother F. E. Skinner finished his earthly course of life on July 4, 1990. Edwin Skinner was 96 years old and had served the interests of Jehovah’s Kingdom full-time in India since July 1926. He was baptized in England in 1919. His life story appeared in The Watchtower of January 1, 1990. Brother Skinner was truly a man of faith and endurance in running the course to the finish, and he has surely gained his reward.​—2 Timothy 4:7, 8.

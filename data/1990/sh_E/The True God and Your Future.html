<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“In this mysterious universe, there is one thing of which Man can feel certain. Man himself is certainly not the greatest spiritual presence in the Universe. . . . There is a presence in the Universe that is spiritually greater than Man himself. . . .

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 1. (Include introduction.) (a) What did historian Toynbee recognize about man and the universe? (b) How does the Bible identify the “absolute spiritual reality”?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">DURING most of the last six thousand years, mankind has searched, with greater or lesser zeal, to find that “absolute spiritual reality.” Each major religion has given that reality a different name. Depending on what your religion may be​—Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, or any other—​you have a name for the “absolute spiritual reality.” But the Bible gives this reality name, gender, and personality​—Jehovah, the living God. That unique God said to Cyrus the Great of Persia: “I am Jehovah, and there is no one else. With the exception of me there is no God. . . . I myself have made the earth and have created even man upon it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:5-23:45:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:12-23:45:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:19-19:68:20" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Psalm 68:19, 20</a>.</p>

Jehovah has revealed himself as the God of prophecy who can tell the end from the beginning. He said through Isaiah the prophet: “Remember the first things of a long time ago, that I am the Divine One and there is no other God, nor anyone like me; the One telling from the beginning the finale, and from long ago the things that have not been done; the One saying, ‘My own counsel will stand, and everything that is my delight I shall do’; . . .

We can also predict what will befall the powerful political organizations that seem to control the world’s destiny. Even more, we can foretell what end awaits “the god of this system of things,” Satan, who “has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” by a multitude of religions that have led mankind away from the true God, Jehovah. And why has Satan done this blinding work? In order “that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>“Babylon the Great” Identified</em></strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 5. What did John see in vision?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The Bible book of Revelation was revealed to the apostle John on the island of Patmos in the year 96 C.E. It paints vivid pictures of major events to take place in the time of the end, the time in which, according to Biblical evidence, mankind has been living since 1914.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Of those symbolic pictures that John saw in vision, one is of a gaudy, brash harlot, called “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” In what condition was she? “I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 6. Why does Babylon the Great not represent the ruling political elements of the world?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Whom does this woman represent? We are not left to guess her identity. By a process of elimination, she can be unmasked. In that same vision, John hears an angel say: “Come, I will show you the judgment upon the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, whereas those who inhabit the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” If the kings, or rulers, of the earth fornicate with her, then it means that the harlot cannot represent the ruling political elements of the world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 17:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:18-66:17:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

Yet, the inspired text says: “The waters that you saw, where the harlot is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.” What other principal element of this world system is left that fits the description of a symbolic harlot fornicating with the political rulers, trading with business interests, and sitting in glory over the peoples, crowds, nations, and tongues? It is false religion in all its different guises!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:15-66:17:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 17:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 18:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>This identification of Babylon the Great is confirmed by an angel’s condemnation of her for her “spiritistic practice [by which] all the nations were misled.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:23-66:18:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 18:23</a>) All forms of spiritism are religious and demon-inspired.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>As we have seen throughout this book, there are common threads going right through the confused tapestry of the world’s religions. Many religions have their roots in mythology. Nearly all are tied together by some form of belief in a supposed immortal human soul that survives death and goes to a hereafter or transmigrates to another creature. Many have the common denominator of belief in a dreadful place of torment and torture called hell. Others are connected by ancient pagan beliefs in triads, trinities, and mother goddesses. Therefore, it is only appropriate <span id="page370" class="pageNum" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>that they should all be grouped together under the one composite symbol of the harlot “Babylon the Great.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>What does the Bible foretell will be the final destiny of this globe-encircling harlot? In symbolic language, the book of Revelation describes her destruction at the hands of political elements. These are symbolized by “ten horns” that support the United Nations, “a scarlet-colored wild beast” that is the image of Satan’s bloodstained political system.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:2-66:16:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 16:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:3-66:17:16" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 17:3-16</a>.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>This destruction of Satan’s world empire of false religion will be the result of God’s adverse judgment of these religions. They will have been found guilty of spiritual fornication because of complicity with their oppressive political paramours and their support of them. False religion has stained its skirts with innocent blood as it has patriotically played along with the elite ruling class of each nation in its wars. Therefore, Jehovah puts it into the hearts of the political elements to perform his will against Babylon the Great and devastate her.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:16-66:17:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 17:16-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>With such a future staring world religions in the face, what should you do? The answer is in what John heard a voice out of heaven saying: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you <span id="page371" class="pageNum" data-no="371" data-before-text="371"></span>do not want to receive part of her plagues. For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.” Therefore, now is the time to obey the angel’s injunction to get out of Satan’s empire of false religion and join in Jehovah’s true worship.

In fact, the destruction of Babylon the Great will usher in a period of “great tribulation” that culminates in “the war of the great day of God the Almighty . . . Har–Magedon.” That war, or battle, of Armageddon will lead to defeat for Satan’s political system and to his being abyssed.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Already, another outstanding Bible prophecy is approaching fulfillment before our eyes. The apostle Paul prophesied and warned: “Now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, you need nothing to be written to you. For you yourselves know quite well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night. Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman; and they will by no means escape.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:1-3</a>.</p>

Yet, what this corrupt world offers is shallow and transient. That is why John’s counsel is so pertinent: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world​—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—​does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” Would you not prefer to remain forever?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

Long ago, in the Hebrew Scriptures, God prophesied that he would carry out his original purpose toward mankind on this earth, namely, to have an obedient human family enjoy perfect life on a paradise earth. Satan’s attempted subversion of that purpose has not annulled God’s promise. Thus, King David could write: “For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.

But Jehovah has promised that he will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” A situation approaching global ruin has existed only in the 20th century.

Jesus had said: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:39-43:11:44" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 11:39-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:31" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Acts 17:30, 31</a>.</p>

Yes, in the new world, there will be only one religion, one form of worship.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Now that you have made a comparison of the major religions of the world, we invite you to investigate further God’s Word, the Bible, on which the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses are based. Prove for yourself that the true God can be found. Whether you are Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, or of any other faith, now is the time to examine your relationship to the true and living God. Probably your religion was decided for you by your place of birth, over which you had no control. Surely, nothing is lost by examining what the Bible says about God. This could be your opportunity of a lifetime really to know the Sovereign Lord God’s purpose for this earth and mankind upon it. Yes, your sincere search for the true God can be satisfied by studying the Bible with Jehovah’s messengers, his Witnesses, who brought you this book.</p>

Call to him while he proves to be near. Let the wicked man leave his way, and the harmful man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:7-40:7:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 7:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:6-23:55:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Isaiah 55:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb">WITH those words, Jesus established a criterion for those claiming to be his true followers. Christian love would have to transcend all racial, tribal, and national divisions. It would require that true Christians should be “no part of the world,” just as Jesus was, and is, “no part of the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:21" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Romans 12:17-21</a>.</p>

For example, how should he act with regard to the turbulent politics, revolutions, and wars of our times? The Christian apostle John wrote, in harmony with Jesus’ words above: “Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother. For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should have love for one another.” And Jesus himself explained why his disciples did not fight to deliver him, saying: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought . . . But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.” Even with Jesus’ life at stake, those attendants did not get involved in settling the controversy <span id="page345" class="pageNum" data-no="345" data-before-text="345"></span>according to the warring ways of the world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 3:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 18:36</a>.</p>

He said: “And it must occur in the final part of the days that the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, . . . and to it all the nations must stream. And many peoples will certainly go and say: ‘Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.’ For out of Zion law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem. And he will certainly render judgment among the nations and set matters straight respecting many peoples. And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.

They have endured prisons, concentration camps, torture, <span id="page346" class="pageNum" data-no="346" data-before-text="346"></span>deportations, and persecution throughout the 20th century because they have refused to sacrifice their love and unity as a worldwide congregation of Christians drawn to God. In Nazi Germany during the years 1933-45, about a thousand Witnesses died and thousands were imprisoned, on account of their refusal to cooperate with Hitler’s war effort. Likewise, under Franco in formerly Fascist Spain, hundreds of young Witnesses went to prison and many spent an average of ten years each in military prisons rather than learn war. To this day in several countries, many young Witnesses of Jehovah languish in prisons because of their stand on Christian neutrality. However, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not interfere with the governments in their military programs. The Witnesses’ unwavering Christian neutrality in political matters has been one of the constants of their beliefs throughout all the conflicts and wars of the 20th century.

They understand that true Christian love results in an indivisible worldwide brotherhood​—above political, racial, and national divisions. In other words, Christianity is more than international; it is <em>supranational, </em>transcending national boundaries, authority, or interests.

He spoke to them, communicating his commandments and wishes. Furthermore, God did not conceal himself from their sons Cain and Abel. He counseled hateful Cain when he showed envy regarding his brother’s sacrifice to God. However, rather than change his form of worship, Cain showed jealous, religious intolerance and murdered his brother Abel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:8-1:3:24" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 3:8-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:1-1:4:16" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 4:1-16</a>.</p>

Whoever makes the confession that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God remains in union with such one and he in union with God. And we ourselves have come to know and have believed the love that God has in our case.” Born a Jew, Jesus was a true witness and died a martyr in faithfulness to his Father, Jehovah.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>In 1870 a zealous young man, Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916), began to ask many questions about Christendom’s <span id="page351" class="pageNum" data-no="351" data-before-text="351"></span>traditional teachings. As a youth, he worked in his father’s haberdashery in the bustling industrial city of Allegheny (now part of Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, U.S.A. His religious background was Presbyterian and Congregational. However, he was perturbed by such teachings as predestination and eternal torment in hellfire. What were his reasons for doubting these basic doctrines of some of Christendom’s religions? He wrote: “A God that would use his power to create human beings whom he foreknew and predestinated should be eternally tormented, could be neither wise, just nor loving. His standard would be lower than that of many men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:31-24:7:31" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 7:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:19:5-24:19:5" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:35-24:32:35" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 32:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:9" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 1 John 4:8, 9</a>.</p>

They began to analyze the Bible’s teachings on other subjects, such as immortality of the soul as well as Christ’s ransom sacrifice and his second coming. In 1877, at the age of 25, Russell sold his share in his father’s prospering business and began a full-time preaching career.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>In 1878 Russell had a major disagreement with one of his collaborators, who had rejected the teaching that Christ’s death could be an atonement for sinners. In his rebuttal Russell wrote: “Christ accomplished various good things for us in his death and resurrection. He was our substitute in death; he died the just <em>for </em>the unjust​—<em>all </em>were unjust. Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for <em>every man. . . . </em>He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” He continued: “To redeem is to buy back. What did Christ buy back for all men? Life. We lost it by the disobedience of the first Adam. The second Adam [Christ] bought it back with his own life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:45-41:10:45" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 10:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:7-45:5:8" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Romans 5:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 1 John 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 4:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Always a staunch advocate of the ransom doctrine, Russell severed all ties with this former collaborator. In July 1879, Russell started to publish <em>Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence, </em>known worldwide today as <em>The Watchtower​—Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. </em>In 1881 he, in association with other dedicated Christians, established a nonprofit Bible society. It was called Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society, known today as the Watch Tower Bible and <span id="page353" class="pageNum" data-no="353" data-before-text="353"></span>Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the legal agency that acts in behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses. From the very beginning, Russell insisted that there would be no collections taken at congregation meetings nor contributions solicited through the Watch Tower publications.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>In their investigation of God’s Word, those Bible Students were keenly interested in the prophecies of the Christian Greek Scriptures related to “the end of the world” and to Christ’s “coming.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>, <em>KJ</em>) By turning to the Greek text, they discovered that Christ’s “coming” was, in fact, a <em>“pa·rou·siʹa,” </em>or <em>invisible presence. </em>Therefore, Christ had given his disciples information about the evidence of his invisible presence in the time of the end, not a future visible coming. Along with this study, those Bible students had a keen desire to understand the Bible’s chronology in relation to Christ’s presence. Without understanding all the details, Russell and his associates realized that 1914 would be a crucial date in human history.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:7-42:21:33" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 21:7-33</a>, <em>Int.</em></p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>The reaction of most of the Bible Students was typified by the words of W. E. Van Amburgh, an official of the Watch Tower Society: “This great worldwide work is not the work of one person.

In 1919 the Watch Tower Society produced a companion magazine to the <em>Watch Tower </em>called <em>The Golden Age, </em>known worldwide today as <em>Awake!</em> This has served as a powerful instrument to awaken people to the significance of the times in which we live and to build confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful new world.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>During the 1920’s and 1930’s, the Bible Students gave more and more emphasis to the early Christian method of preaching​—from house to house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>) Each believer had the responsibility to witness to as many people as possible regarding Christ’s Kingdom rule. They came to see clearly from the Bible that the great issue before mankind was that of universal sovereignty and that this would be settled by Jehovah God’s crushing Satan and all his ruinous works on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Romans 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:17-66:11:18" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:17, 18</a>) In the context of this issue, it was appreciated that the salvation of man was secondary to the vindication of God as the rightful Sovereign. Therefore, there would have to be on earth <span id="page358" class="pageNum" data-no="358" data-before-text="358"></span>faithful witnesses willing to testify to God’s purposes and supremacy. How was this need satisfied?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 8:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:20" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">27. (a) What momentous event took place in 1931? (b) What are some of the Witnesses’ distinctive beliefs?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>In July 1931, the Bible Students held a convention in Columbus, Ohio, during which the thousands present adopted a resolution. In it they joyfully embraced “the name which the mouth of the Lord God has named,” and they declared: “We desire to be known as and called by the name, to wit, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’” Ever since that date, Jehovah’s Witnesses have become known worldwide not only for their distinctive beliefs but also for their zealous house-to-house and street ministry. (See pages 356-7.)​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Matthew 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Acts 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">28. In 1935 what clearer understanding did the Witnesses receive regarding Kingdom rulership?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>In 1935 the Witnesses came to a clearer understanding regarding the heavenly Kingdom class, who will reign with Christ, and their subjects on the earth. They already knew that the number of anointed Christians called to rule with Christ from the heavens would be only 144,000. So, what would be the hope for the rest of mankind? A government needs subjects to justify its existence. This heavenly government, the Kingdom, would also have millions of obedient subjects here on earth. These would be the “great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,” who cry out: “Salvation we owe to our God [Jehovah], who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb [Christ Jesus].”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:3" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 14:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:16-45:8:17" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Romans 8:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">29. What challenge did the Witnesses perceive and accept?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>This understanding about the great crowd helped Jehovah’s Witnesses to see that they had before them a tremendous <span id="page359" class="pageNum" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>challenge​—to find and teach all those millions who were searching for the true God and who would form the “great crowd.” It would involve an international educational campaign. It would require trained speakers and ministers. Schools would be needed. All of this was envisioned by the next president of the Watch Tower Society.</p>

<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="qu">30. What events of the 1930’s and 1940’s affected the Witnesses?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>In 1931 there were under 50,000 Witnesses in fewer than 50 lands. The events of the 1930’s and 1940’s did not make their preaching any easier. This period saw the rise of Fascism and Nazism and the outbreak of World War II. In 1942 J. F. Rutherford died. The Watch Tower Society would need vigorous leadership in order to give further impetus to the preaching of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">31. What began functioning in 1943 to expand the preaching of the good news?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>In 1942, at the age of 36, Nathan H. Knorr was chosen to be the third president of the Watch Tower Society. He was an energetic organizer with clear insight into the need to promote the preaching of the good news in all the world as fast as possible, even though the nations were still embroiled in World War II. As a result, he immediately put into effect a plan for a school to train missionaries, called the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> The first hundred students, all full-time ministers, were enrolled in January 1943. They studied the Bible and related ministerial subjects intensively for nearly six months before being sent out to their assignments, mainly in foreign countries. Up to 1990, <span id="page360" class="pageNum" data-no="360" data-before-text="360"></span>89 classes have graduated, and thousands of ministers have gone out from Gilead to serve around the world.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">32. What progress has been made by Jehovah’s Witnesses since 1943?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><sup>32 </sup>In 1943 there were only 126,329 Witnesses preaching in 54 countries. In spite of atrocious opposition from Nazism, Fascism, Communism, and Catholic Action as well as from the so-called democracies during World War II, by 1946 Jehovah’s Witnesses had reached a peak of over 176,000 Kingdom preachers. Forty-four years later, there were nearly four million active in over 200 lands, islands, and territories. Without a doubt, their clear identification by name and action has served to make them known worldwide. But other factors have been involved that have greatly influenced their effectiveness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">33. Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses have Kingdom Halls?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><sup>33 </sup>Jehovah’s Witnesses hold weekly Bible study meetings in their Kingdom Halls that serve over 60,000 congregations throughout the earth. These meetings are not based on ritual or on emotion but on the gaining of accurate knowledge of God, his Word, and his purposes. Therefore, Jehovah’s Witnesses come together three times a week to increase their understanding of the Bible and to learn how to preach and teach its message to others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:11" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Philippians 1:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">34. What is the purpose of the Theocratic Ministry School?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" data-rel-pid="[87]" class="sb"><sup>34 </sup>For example, a midweek meeting includes the Theocratic Ministry School, in which members of the congregation may be enrolled. This school, presided over by a qualified Christian elder, serves to train men, women, and children in the art of teaching and self-expression in accordance with Bible principles. The apostle Paul stated: “Let <span id="page361" class="pageNum" data-no="361" data-before-text="361"></span>your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” In their Christian meetings, the Witnesses also learn how to express the Kingdom message “with a mild temper and deep respect.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">35. What are some other meetings the Witnesses hold, and what are their benefits?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" data-rel-pid="[88]" class="sb"><sup>35 </sup>On a different day, the Witnesses also meet for a 45-minute Bible discourse followed by a one-hour congregation consideration (by means of questions and answers) of a <span id="page362" class="pageNum" data-no="362" data-before-text="362"></span>Bible theme related to Christian teaching or conduct. Members of the congregation are free to participate. Every year the Witnesses also attend three larger meetings, assemblies and conventions of one to four days, where thousands usually gather to listen to Bible discourses. As a result of these and other free meetings, each Witness deepens his or her knowledge of God’s promises for this earth and for mankind in addition to acquiring an excellent education in Christian morals. Each one is drawn closer to the true God, Jehovah, by following the teachings and example of Christ Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 6:44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:65-43:6:65" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 65;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">36. (a) Do the Witnesses have a paid clergy class? (b) Who, then, take the lead in the congregation?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><sup>36 </sup>Logically, if Jehovah’s Witnesses hold meetings and are organized to preach, they must have someone to take the lead. However, they do not have a paid clergy class nor do they have any charismatic leader on a pedestal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 23:10</a>) Jesus said: “You received free, give free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matthew 10:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:18-44:8:21" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Acts 8:18-21</a>) In each congregation, there are spiritually qualified elders and ministerial servants, many of whom have secular employment and care for a family, who voluntarily take the lead in teaching and directing the congregation. This is precisely the model set by first-century Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Acts 20:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:1-50:1:1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Philippians 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:10" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 3:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:12-54:3:13" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[90]" class="sb"><sup>37 </sup>How are these elders and ministerial servants appointed? Their appointments are made under the supervision of a governing body of anointed elders from various lands whose function is parallel to that of the body of apostles and elders in Jerusalem who took the lead in the early Christian congregation. <span id="page363" class="pageNum" data-no="363" data-before-text="363"></span>As we saw in Chapter 11, no one apostle had the primacy over the others. They came to their decisions as a body, and these were respected by the congregations scattered throughout the ancient Roman world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:4-44:15:6" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Acts 15:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:22-44:15:23" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 22, 23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:30-44:15:31" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 30, 31</a>.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><sup>38 </sup>The same arrangement functions for the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses today. They hold weekly meetings at their world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and instructions are then sent from there to the Branch Committees around the world that superintend the ministerial activity in each country. By following the example of the earliest Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been able to cover vast portions of the earth with the preaching of the good news of <span id="page364" class="pageNum" data-no="364" data-before-text="364"></span>God’s Kingdom. That work continues on a global scale.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:23-40:10:23" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 10:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:58</a>.</p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" data-rel-pid="[92]" class="sb"><sup>39 </sup>During the 20th century, Jehovah’s Witnesses have prospered throughout the earth. This has even been true in lands where they have been under ban or proscription. These bans were imposed mainly by regimes that failed to understand the neutral position of Jehovah’s Witnesses regarding the political and nationalistic allegiances of this world. (See box, page 347.) Yet, in such lands, tens of thousands of people have turned to God’s Kingdom as the only true hope for peace and security for mankind. In most nations a tremendous witness has been given, and now there <span id="page365" class="pageNum" data-no="365" data-before-text="365"></span>are millions of active Witnesses everywhere.​—See chart, page 361.</p>

He is in subjection to Jehovah. “But when all things will have been subjected to him [Christ], then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:28-46:15:28" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matthew 24:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Mark 12:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:3" data-bid="47-3" class="b"> John 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:18" data-bid="47-4" class="b"> 14-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:20" data-bid="47-5" class="b"> Colossians 1:15-20</a>.</p>

<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="se"><strong><em>Answer: </em></strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses do not practice any form of idolatry, whether it involves idols, persons, or organizations.</p>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sc">  “We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. For even though there are those who are called ‘gods,’ whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords,’ there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:4-46:8:6" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:15-19:135:18" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 135:15-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="se"><strong><em>Answer: </em></strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in transubstantiation, a Roman Catholic teaching. They do celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal on the date corresponding to the Jewish Nisan 14 (usually in March or April) as an annual memorial of Christ’s death. At this meeting they pass around the congregation unleavened bread and red wine in symbol of Christ’s sinless body and sacrificial blood. Only those with the hope of reigning with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom partake of the emblems.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:22-41:14:26" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Mark 14:22-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:29-42:22:29" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Luke 22:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:26" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 11:23-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:5" data-bid="51-4" class="b"> Revelation 14:1-5</a>.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span></p>

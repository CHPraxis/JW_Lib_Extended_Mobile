How Can I Control My TV Viewing Habits?
Perhaps you have asked yourself this question, as well as others: “How Can I Say No to Premarital Sex?” “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?” “Why Do I Get So Depressed?” These are chapter titles in the new book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work.
A youth from San Antonio, Texas, wrote: “I really enjoyed chapter 36, ‘How Can I Control My TV Viewing Habits?’ It will really help me. I am a compulsive TV watcher. I’m sure that now I’ll be able to overcome my addiction to TV.”
Growing up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths need answers that work, that give direct answers to problems. No doubt you or your children would benefit greatly from this attractively illustrated, 320-page publication. If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.
I would like to receive the 320-page, hardcover book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)

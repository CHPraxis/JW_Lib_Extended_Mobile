Nicholas . . . excommunicated Photius; a council at Constantinople responded (867) by excommunicating Nicholas in turn. The immediate issues between the two sees <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>were matters of ecclesiastical supremacy, the liturgy, and clerical discipline.”​—<em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>

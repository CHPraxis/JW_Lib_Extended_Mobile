Help in Growing Up
GROWING up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should I smoke? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? What about masturbation and homosexuality? One youth wrote:
“I am now almost 13 years old, and I just wanted to thank you for the Youth book. This book has helped me so much through these hard times of growing up. I just wish all kids my age or older knew about this book.”
This book, which considers all the above questions and many more, is Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.
This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.
I would like to receive the 192-​page, hardcover book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)

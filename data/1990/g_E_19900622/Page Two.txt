In June 1988 the Roman Catholic Church had its first schism, or division, in over a century. Traditionalist archbishop Lefebvre was excommunicated. A year after the split, the rebel prelate claimed a 10- to 20-​percent increase in the number of his adherents.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Catholic theologians signed a declaration protesting what they consider to be the pope’s abuse of power in the appointment of new bishops and in doctrinal matters, such as birth control.
Politically, Catholics are deeply divided, some being ultraconservative, others advocating social reforms and even armed revolution. The average Catholic may be bewildered by these divisions.

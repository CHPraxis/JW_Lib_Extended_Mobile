<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GROWING up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should I smoke? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? What about masturbation and homosexuality? One youth wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am now almost 13 years old, and I just wanted to thank you for the <em>Youth </em>book. This book has helped me so much through these hard times of growing up. I just wish all kids my age or older knew about this book.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This book, which considers all the above questions and many more, is <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I would like to receive the 192-​page, hardcover book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)</p>

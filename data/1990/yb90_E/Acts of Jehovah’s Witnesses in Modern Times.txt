Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Colombia’s Real Gold  66
Colombia gold: Is it the precious yellow metal or the pernicious white drug cocaine? Neither. The real gold of this South American country is found among her people​—the thousands that are making a good name with God.
Finland’s Satisfying Standard  138
Finland, with its silvery lakes and its forests robed in green, has one of the highest living standards in the world. However, thousands of her hearty inhabitants searched for a more satisfying standard and have found it, even at the threat of death by firing squad.
Suriname’s Intrepid Witnesses  192
Snakes and jaguars lurk in the mountainous rain forest that blankets most of Suriname​—the smallest country in South America, both in area and in population. And when it comes to the courage of the worshipers of Jehovah God, the country is second to none.

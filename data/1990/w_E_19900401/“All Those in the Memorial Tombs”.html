<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">CAN you be sure that most of the dead will live again? Yes, since Jesus said: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) Notice the expression “memorial tombs,” which is unique to the <em>New World Translation. </em>It reminds us of the importance of God’s memory in the resurrection.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Why is the usual rendering, “graves,” not used? Because Jesus did not use the plural of the Greek word <em>taʹphos, </em>which means “grave” or “burial ground.” Indeed, not all who ever died were buried in literal graves, or <em>taʹphoi.</em> Nevertheless, those whom God will bring back in the resurrection are in his memory. This is indicated by Jesus’ use of the plural form of <em>mne·meiʹon, </em>which is closely related to Greek words basically meaning “to remember.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:9-40:16:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 16:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:18-41:8:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mark 8:18</a>) The <em>Greek-English Lexicon </em>by H. G. Liddell and R. Scott translates <em>mne·meiʹon </em>as <em>“memorial, remembrance, record </em>of a person or thing, . . . <em>tomb, </em>. . . generally, <em>monument.”</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thus, the <em>New World Translation </em>differentiates between the words <em>taʹphos </em>and <em>mne·meiʹon. </em>It is also worthy of note that many Bible translations similarly use two different expressions at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:29-40:23:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 23:29</a> where both Greek terms appear. The <em>Revised Standard Version </em>renders them as follows: “You build the tombs [a form of <em>taʹphos</em>] of the prophets and adorn the monuments [a form of <em>mne·meiʹon</em>] of the righteous.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Creator of man does not forget the life patterns of thousands of millions of humans who have lived. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:16-19:139:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 139:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:4-19:147:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 147:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:30-40:10:30" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matthew 10:30</a>) In his due time, he will remember those in the “memorial tombs” and bring them back to life on a cleansed earth. How encouraged and comforted we are by knowing that God’s perfect memory cannot fail!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:11-66:20:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 20:11-13</a>.</p>

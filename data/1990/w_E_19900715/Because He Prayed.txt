Because He Prayed
AT 1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18, the apostle Paul said: “Pray incessantly. In connection with everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in union with Christ Jesus respecting you.” However, do you sometimes find yourself reluctant to give thanks when enjoying a meal in a public place, such as a restaurant? In view of Jesus’ caution against ostentatious prayer, it is understandable that one may wish to avoid attracting undue attention to oneself. (Matthew 6:5, 6) Nevertheless, a discreetly offered prayer may well attract favorable notice.
This was the experience of one young minister serving at Brooklyn Bethel, the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He was eating breakfast at a restaurant, planning to go to his local congregation and meet with a group that would be participating in Kingdom-preaching activity. When his breakfast arrived, he offered a prayer in his usual manner. Upon opening his eyes, he looked up to find a waitress standing there staring at him.
“You’re praying, aren’t you?” she asked. When he answered in the affirmative, she said: “You must be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. My parents are too. I never really got involved in their religion, but I know I should. Maybe I should get a subscription to The Watchtower and Awake! Can I get them from you?”
“I nearly choked on my food,” the young brother recalls. Nevertheless, he was able to place two subscriptions and the latest two magazines with her and to arrange for a return visit​—all because he prayed.

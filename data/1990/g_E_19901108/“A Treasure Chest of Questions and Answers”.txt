“A Treasure Chest of Questions and Answers”
That is what a woman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., called the handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. She explained: “I recently had two of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to my home. . . . One mistakenly left a book entitled Reasoning From the Scriptures. I must admit, I ransacked that book! I sat reading it for hours. I was extremely impressed. . . . This book was to me like a treasure chest of questions and answers, many that I’ve asked myself.”
This vital handbook contains over 70 main subject headings. Included are “Abortion,” “Drugs,” “Holidays,” “Rapture,” “Reincarnation,” “Sex,” and “Spiritism.” Its seven-page index of subjects and scriptures can help you to find answers quickly.

I would like to receive the hardcover 448-page handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)

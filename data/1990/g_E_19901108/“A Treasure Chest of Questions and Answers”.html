<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a woman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., called the handbook <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>She explained: “I recently had two of Jehovah’s Witnesses come to my home. . . . One mistakenly left a book entitled <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>I must admit, I ransacked that book! I sat reading it for hours. I was extremely impressed. . . . This book was to me like a treasure chest of questions and answers, many that I’ve asked myself.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This vital handbook contains over 70 main subject headings. Included are “Abortion,” “Drugs,” “Holidays,” “Rapture,” “Reincarnation,” “Sex,” and “Spiritism.” Its seven-page index of subjects and scriptures can help you to find answers quickly.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JESUS CHRIST’S command to push the witnessing work to “the most distant part of the earth” must embrace business areas. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) In Japan, giving the Kingdom witness to people who work in public agencies and offices of big companies presents quite a challenge. Kingdom publishers in one congregation obtained permission to do magazine witnessing in a city office building during lunch break. The publishers not only prayed to Jehovah to give them courage but paid much attention to their dress and conduct and even prepared lapel cards showing their names and identifying them as Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Witness would approach a worker, saying: “Excuse me, I was given permission to talk to people here. Would you mind listening to me while you eat?” The Witnesses had to show good judgment and use words “seasoned with salt.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>) On their first visit, they placed 39 magazines, but it took up to four visits to cover the entire eight-story building where 1,500 people work. They placed a total of more than a hundred magazines and were able to start magazine routes and make return visits.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One of the publishers made a return visit on a manager. When he heard a scripture read from the <em>New World Translation, </em>he said: “This Bible is easy to understand. The one I read before was in archaic Japanese and was very difficult to read.” A copy of the <em>New World Translation </em>was delivered to him the following week.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Can you do more in your congregation’s territory to preach the good news to “all sorts of men,” including those in business districts?​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:4</a>.</p>

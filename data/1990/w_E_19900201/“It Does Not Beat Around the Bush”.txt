“It Does Not Beat Around the Bush”
Growing up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should I drink? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? Youths need answers that work, that don’t beat around the bush. On reading the new book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, a Greensboro, North Carolina, youth wrote:
“This book is very comprehensive and has fine examples for each problem. Once you start reading it, you just can’t put it down, the chapters are so interesting. It does not beat around the bush, so to speak, but gives direct answers to the problem.
“All in all, this book is inevitably marvelous, truthful, fantastic, . . . words just cannot express how great this book is. I would highly recommend this book to all, particularly to youths.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a person from Springfield, Oregon, U.S.A., said regarding the cassette tapes of the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher. </em>“This is truly a most wonderful way of teaching anyone,” she writes. “The sound advice to parents and to the little ones is so wonderfully imparted! I can’t think of anything but ‘wonderful’ to describe the way the book is read, the way the stories are told! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! Please send two more sets. Enclosed please find a check for the tapes.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The album contains four cassette tapes and the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher. </em>Playing time is a little over five hours. The book is designed for reading with young ones, but the whole family can benefit by listening to the tapes together. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I would like to receive the colorful vinyl album with the four cassette tapes and the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

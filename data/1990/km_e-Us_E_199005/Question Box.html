<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What schedule should be followed in the special meeting that includes the Congregation Book Study during the week of the circuit overseer’s visit?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the visit of the circuit overseer, arrangements are made for the entire congregation to assemble at the Kingdom Hall for a special meeting that includes the Congregation Book Study, a consideration of Scriptural and organizational information entitled “Continue in the Things That You Learned,” and a service talk by the circuit overseer. This meeting is preferably held on Thursday or Friday night.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The meeting begins with song and prayer, and then one of the elders conducts a 45-minute Congregation Book Study. Effort should be made to cover all the material assigned for the week, having all the paragraphs read, just as is customarily done in the regular weekly study. The Congregation Book Study is followed by the singing of another Kingdom song. The circuit overseer then uses 30 minutes to conduct the portion “Continue in the Things That You Learned.” After that, he delivers a 30-minute service talk adapted especially to the needs of the congregation being served. In the service talk, he gives appropriate commendation and counsel designed to build up the congregation and encourage the brothers to remain steadfast in Kingdom service.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The meeting is concluded with song and prayer. All the songs used are to be selected by the circuit overseer. The entire program, including songs and prayers, should not exceed two hours.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This arrangement initiated in 1977 has contributed much to making the visit of the circuit overseer something special for the enjoyment and benefit of the whole congregation and for the individual publishers who attend and participate in this fine provision of Jehovah’s organization.</p>

Something Better Than Television
A mother from Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A., writes that for her four-year-old son, she has just ordered a second set of cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. She confesses: “Many times while we, his father and I, are watching television in the living room, he will be in the kitchen playing and listening to the Bible stories. It bothers us so much that the television set gets turned off.”
She concludes: “We feel sure that the Bible Stories tapes have helped him to be a calmer and happier little boy. . . . Thank you very much.”
Listening to the cassettes of the 116 stories in My Book of Bible Stories is a marvelous way for young ones to learn what the Bible is all about. A young child can remember more than you think if he has the interest. Many families have found My Book of Bible Stories, along with the recording of the book on cassette tapes, to be just what is needed to stimulate that interest. You can receive the cassette tapes or the volume My Book of Bible Stories, or both, by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Check either or both of the following, and remit the correct contribution:
□Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (U.S.).(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)
□Please send the illustrated 256-page My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $3 (U.S.).

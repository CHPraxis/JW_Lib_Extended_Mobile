<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mother from Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A., writes that for her four-year-old son, she has just ordered a second set of cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>She confesses: “Many times while we, his father and I, are watching television in the living room, he will be in the kitchen playing and listening to the Bible stories. It bothers us so much that the television set gets turned off.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She concludes: “We feel sure that the <em>Bible Stories </em>tapes have helped him to be a calmer and happier little boy. . . . Thank you very much.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Listening to the cassettes of the 116 stories in <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>is a marvelous way for young ones to learn what the Bible is all about.

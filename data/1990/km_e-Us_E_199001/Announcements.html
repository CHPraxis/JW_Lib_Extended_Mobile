(For obtaining credit, elders should refer to the guidelines in the Society’s letter of December 21, 1988.) If the congregation has no stock of books to be offered at the reduced rate, the <em>Worldwide Security </em>book should be offered for a contribution of $1.00. This book may be ordered from Brooklyn. <strong>March: </strong><em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>for a contribution of $1.00. <strong>April and May: </strong><em>Watchtower </em>subscription.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Starting in February and no later than March 1, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Exulting in Jehovah at Poland Conventions.” This will be a slide presentation recounting some of the highlights of the 1989 “Godly Devotion” District Conventions held in Poland.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● The special public talk for the 1990 Memorial season will be given worldwide on Sunday, March 25, 1990. The subject of the talk will be “Reach Out for the Real Life!” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before March 25.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>

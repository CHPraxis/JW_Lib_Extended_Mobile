<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Each Kingdom Hall should be clearly identified by an appropriate sign that reads: “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” The sign should be neat, in good taste, and well maintained.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Where congregations using different languages meet in the same Kingdom Hall, ordinarily a Kingdom Hall sign should be posted in each language. This undoubtedly makes it easier for people who speak those languages to identify our place of worship. The bodies of elders of the congregations concerned should be able to make arrangements for posting appropriate Kingdom Hall signs in the languages of the congregations using a particular Kingdom Hall.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Additionally, where practical, meeting times should be posted and kept up-to-date. A Kingdom Hall used by more than one language group should have a composite sign signifying the meeting times of each language group.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The 1990 service year ended with 850,120 publishers in the field. This was our fourth publisher peak for the year. It was 24,841 more than our previous peak in April and 32,239 over August of last year. That represents a 4-percent increase in publishers for the year. Jehovah has certainly proved himself to be a helper to all those pressing ahead zealously in his service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:6-58:13:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 13:6</a>) May the 1991 service year also be fruitful as many more accept the invitation to “Come!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>.</p>

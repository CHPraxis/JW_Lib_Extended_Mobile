Comfort in Time of Need
The following letter was received from a man in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.: “Please send the illustrated 192-page hardcover book Is This Life All There Is? I would like to have two copies of this, as I want one for a friend. I saw the offer in a small pamphlet called What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? that I received in my door. I just lost a loved one who was very dear to me for 35 years, and I found the words on the pamphlet so interesting and comforting that I didn’t want to ruin it by cutting the ad out where the name and address goes. Thanks for all your trouble. From now on I will make it a point to read all the literature that you print.”
Happily, there is hope for dead loved ones. Receive the heartwarming evidence in the book Is This Life All There Is? as well as the tract What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? Simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the hardcover, 192-page book Is This Life All There Is? and the tract What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

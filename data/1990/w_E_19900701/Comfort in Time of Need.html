<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The following letter was received from a man in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.: “Please send the illustrated 192-page hardcover book <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>I would like to have two copies of this, as I want one for a friend. I saw the offer in a small pamphlet called <em>What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </em>that I received in my door. I just lost a loved one who was very dear to me for 35 years, and I found the words on the pamphlet so interesting and comforting that I didn’t want to ruin it by cutting the ad out where the name and address goes. Thanks for all your trouble. From now on I will make it a point to read all the literature that you print.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Happily, there is hope for dead loved ones. Receive the heartwarming evidence in the book <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>as well as the tract <em>What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </em>Simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I would like to receive the hardcover, 192-page book <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>and the tract <em>What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is the opinion of a former evolutionist regarding the fascinating book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>He writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“As a former science student, I am stunned by the clarity and power of this book. I am thrilled by the awe-inspiring descriptions of the universe, the galaxies, and all the intricate details that make life possible on planet Earth. I am amazed and delighted by the wealth of heart-stirring information on animal life and the instinctive wisdom that is all around us. And I am humbled by the descriptions of the human brain and its prodigious feats.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Even if this book did not help a person to resolve the question of evolution versus creation, I think that it’s the finest science book I’ve ever read for building appreciation for life and the complexities of living things. It’s very sophisticated scientifically, yet on a level that anyone can appreciate.”</p>

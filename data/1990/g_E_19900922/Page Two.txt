The garbage crisis as seen by world leaders, environmentalists, and concerned citizens is a growing problem that must be reckoned with. It has been called “the crisis of the 90’s.” Magazines devote columns of space to warning of this global plight. “Buried Alive,” headlined the cover page of Newsweek magazine. “The Garbage Glut: An Environmental Crisis Reaches Our Doorstep,” the magazine announced. “Tons and tons of trash and no place to put it” was the title of U.S.News & World Report’s article on garbage. “Garbage, Garbage, Everywhere. Landfills are overflowing, but alternatives are few,” Time magazine heralded in bold type. “West’s Garbage​—A Growing Burden for Third World,” headlined the Paris International Herald Tribune.

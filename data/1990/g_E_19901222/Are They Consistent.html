<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN Roman Catholic cardinal John O’Connor indicated that Catholic politicians could be excommunicated if they do not support the church’s position on abortion, syndicated columnist Mike Royko wrote: “Meanwhile, we have a priest [Louis Gigante] going into court and saying that one of New York’s best-known gangsters, a career mug and menace, isn’t really a gangster at all.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Royko added: “I’ve never read anything about O’Connor announcing: ‘Anybody who is connected with a crime family​—the Genovese outfit, the Gambino mob and the rest of them—​faces excommunication. Just because someone became a member of our church as a tiny tot doesn’t mean that we have to tolerate his anti-social behavior when he becomes the Godfather.’”</p>

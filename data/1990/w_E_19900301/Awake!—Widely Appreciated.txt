“Our school is regularly receiving the Awake! magazine [in Thai], and we notice that the September 8, 1988, issue is on the subject ‘Parents,’ which all parents of schoolchildren should read. We therefore would like you to send us 250-400 copies, if available, to distribute at the next parents/​teachers meeting.”
A woman from Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.A., writes: “I am a devout Baptist . . . , but I picked up one of your papers Awake! in a neighborhood Laundromat and have been so enlightened. I have enjoyed reading it. I am herewith enclosing a [$5 check], for which send me a year’s subscription to Awake!”

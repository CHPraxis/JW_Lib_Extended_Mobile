<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">AMONG over 40,000 Witnesses of Jehovah in Venezuela is a five-year-old lad who had an endearing experience. He had listened carefully to public talks based on the publication <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here?​—By Evolution or by Creation? </em>and to later family considerations of this book. The five-year-old, who was from a theocratic family, thus understood that evolution claims that man came into existence from a “soup.” One of the passages in the book discusses the evolutionary teaching that life evolved from an organic soup.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For 14 years, a family next door (husband, wife, two teenage sons, and a seven-year-old daughter) had been indifferent to the requests of the Witness family to investigate the Bible and to their invitations to go to the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One day while the Witness wife was washing dishes, she heard an interesting conversation between her son and the little neighbor girl, near the dividing fence. The little boy said: “What do you know! The worldly people say that man came out of a soup!” The little girl answered back, as she usually did: “Are you crazy?” The little boy replied: “No, I’m not crazy. The worldly people say that man came out of a soup; but Jehovah made man.” The boy ridiculed the idea, thinking it would be ordinary soup for eating, which he did not like. Then he went on to tell the little girl: “My daddy should give the <em>Creation </em>book to your daddy so that he will see that God created man.” The little girl, however, said that they were Catholics, and that ended the conversation.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When the sister’s husband, who is an elder, came home from work, she related the conversation she had overheard. Although the incident between the children made them laugh, the brother thought that perhaps Jehovah wanted him to witness once again to this neighbor man. So a few days later, he approached his neighbor and related the children’s conversation. He said that on behalf of his son, he wanted to give him a copy of the <em>Creation </em>book. The Witness recommended that the neighbor read it without prejudice, as it would show the origin of life.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">To the brother’s surprise, some days later this couple, who for so long had been indifferent to the truth, presented themselves at the brother’s home expressing regret for the attitude they had held for so many years. They said they marveled at the wonderful quality of the <em>Creation </em>book.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The result was that a Bible study was started with this family. They began to attend meetings regularly and soon became publishers of the good news. The man, his wife, and the two teenage sons were baptized at a district convention, and the girl is also a Kingdom publisher. The wife commenced regular auxiliary pioneer service immediately after her baptism.</p>

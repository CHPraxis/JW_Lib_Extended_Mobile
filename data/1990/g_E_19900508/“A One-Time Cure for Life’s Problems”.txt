“A One-​Time Cure for Life’s Problems”
That is how one reader described the book Happiness​—How to Find It. He wrote: “Having read all the book, I have found that it is timely, invaluable, orthodox and a one-​time cure for life’s problems.
“The first 4 chapters are a challenge to atheists and evolutionists, the middle 12 chapters are a therapy for unhappiness and complex problems . . . the last 4 chapters are a challenge to clergymen and churchgoers.
“All those who have read the book with me can see what I have seen​—the Bible is practical. The Bible is for all centuries and decades.”
This 192-​page book provides the best possible advice on dealing with problems involving money, sex, family, sickness, and death.
This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.
I would like to receive the hardbound book Happiness​—How to Find It. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how one reader described the book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It. </em>He wrote: “Having read all the book, I have found that it is timely, invaluable, orthodox and a one-​time cure for life’s problems.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The first 4 chapters are a challenge to atheists and evolutionists, the middle 12 chapters are a therapy for unhappiness and complex problems . . . the last 4 chapters are a challenge to clergymen and churchgoers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“All those who have read the book with me can see what I have seen​—the Bible is practical. The Bible is for all centuries and decades.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This 192-​page book provides the best possible advice on dealing with problems involving money, sex, family, sickness, and death.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I would like to receive the hardbound book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

“Music That Heals”
A woman from Spain wrote to the German branch of the Watch Tower Society: “I am so grateful that I simply had to write to tell you about it.” Why was she so grateful?
“I have lived in Spain for about nine years,” she explained, “and one and a half years ago, two of your young people started to study the Bible with me. Having read in The Watchtower an article about music that heals, I asked them to get the cassettes for me.
“Some time later, feeling depressed and in some pain, I put the music on. What a difference! Within a short time, the emotional pain was gone, and my mood had improved considerably. How pleased I was to have those music cassettes! Since then, I have often listened to them during sleepless nights. It really is music that heals.”
Many have come to appreciate the album Sing Praises to Jehovah, which contains eight cassettes of piano music. If you are interested in obtaining this album, fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.
I would like to receive the album Sing Praises to Jehovah with the eight cassette music tapes. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

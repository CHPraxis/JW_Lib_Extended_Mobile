<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman from Spain wrote to the German branch of the Watch Tower Society: “I am so grateful that I simply had to write to tell you about it.” Why was she so grateful?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have lived in Spain for about nine years,” she explained, “and one and a half years ago, two of your young people started to study the Bible with me. Having read in <em>The Watchtower </em>an article about music that heals, I asked them to get the cassettes for me.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Some time later, feeling depressed and in some pain, I put the music on. What a difference! Within a short time, the emotional pain was gone, and my mood had improved considerably. How pleased I was to have those music cassettes! Since then, I have often listened to them during sleepless nights. It really is music that heals.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many have come to appreciate the album <em>Sing Praises to Jehovah, </em>which contains eight cassettes of piano music. If you are interested in obtaining this album, fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I would like to receive the album <em>Sing Praises to Jehovah </em>with the eight cassette music tapes. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

“They Have Affected My Life-​Style”
A man from West Africa said this about The Watchtower and Awake!: “I can certainly say that these magazines have won my heart over for Christ. They give one information one needs to know about Christ and salvation. When these magazines were first introduced to me by a friend, I thought they would be boring. Strangely, the more I read them, the more I enjoyed them. They have affected my life-​style. I found them interesting and very educational.
“Please,” the man concluded, “send me copies of these great magazines from month to month.” You too can have The Watchtower and Awake! delivered to your home. If you wish to receive both of these magazines (four copies a month) for one year, please fill out and mail the coupon below.
This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.
I would like to have The Watchtower and Awake! delivered to my home for one year. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

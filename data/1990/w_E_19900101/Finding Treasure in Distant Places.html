<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The search for gold, or other material treasure, has caused many to travel to distant places. But others have gone to find something far more precious​—people with qualities that make them highly desirable to God. Read in the <em>1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>about this genuine treasure.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A person who read last year’s <em>Yearbook </em>wrote: “It’s amazing how close you get to some of those you’ve never even met, and how you share with them in their sorrows and joys! I get such great encouragement from these accounts.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This year’s <em>Yearbook </em>has exciting reports about the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Colombia, Finland, and Suriname, as well as an up-to-date picture of the work that Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing worldwide.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the <em>1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>I enclose $1 (U.S.).</p>

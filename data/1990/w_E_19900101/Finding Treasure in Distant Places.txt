Finding Treasure in Distant Places
The search for gold, or other material treasure, has caused many to travel to distant places. But others have gone to find something far more precious​—people with qualities that make them highly desirable to God. Read in the 1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses about this genuine treasure.
A person who read last year’s Yearbook wrote: “It’s amazing how close you get to some of those you’ve never even met, and how you share with them in their sorrows and joys! I get such great encouragement from these accounts.”
This year’s Yearbook has exciting reports about the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Colombia, Finland, and Suriname, as well as an up-to-date picture of the work that Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Evolutionists say: ‘Evolution is a fact; God is a myth.’ They have proof for neither, but prejudice needs no proof.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>PRIVATE PROPERTY. Keep Out. This Means You, God! </strong>Evolutionists post the subject of biology and tell God to stay out of it. ‘All <em>competent </em>scientists believe evolution,’ they say. Which also says, in effect: ‘Scientists who do not believe are incompetent; they lack <em>our </em>expertise.’ As for God, they say he has no place in scientific thinking. Moreover, even his existence is not provable.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This glib dismissal of God is the greatest fraud of all.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>The New Biology, </em>by Robert Augros and George Stanciu, highlights on page 188 some of the statements of prominent scientists who brush God aside: “The common opinion holds that Darwin rid biology of the need for God once and for all. Eldredge says, Darwin ‘taught us that we can understand life’s history in purely naturalistic terms, without recourse to the supernatural or divine.’ Julian Huxley said: ‘Darwinism removed the whole idea of God as a creator of organisms from the sphere of rational discussion.’ Jacob writes: ‘The idea that each species was separately designed by a Creator, was demolished by Darwin.’ And Simpson writes of the origin of the first organism: ‘There is, at any rate, no reason to postulate a miracle. Nor is it necessary to suppose that the origin of the new processes of reproduction and mutation was anything but materialistic.’”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">‘But does not this leave life on earth without a Creator-​Designer?’ you ask. ‘None needed,’ evolutionists answer. ‘It is in the lap of chance. Blind chance is the designer. We call it Natural Selection.’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But the more we learn, the more design we see. The input of intelligence and wisdom is staggering. Is it not too much for blind, unthinking, brainless chance to handle? Consider just a few of the hundreds of devices in nature that reflect creative wisdom​—which human inventors have frequently copied.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>The aerodynamics of the wings of birds preceded by millenniums the inferior design found in the wings of planes. The chambered nautilus and the cuttlefish use flotation tanks to maintain buoyancy at whatever depth they swim, much more efficiently than modern submarines do. The octopus and the squid are masters of jet propulsion. Bats and dolphins are experts with sonar. Several reptiles and seabirds have their own built-​in “desalination plants” that enable them to drink seawater. Some microscopic bacteria have rotary motors that they can run forward and in reverse.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By ingeniously designed nests and by their use of water, termites air-​condition their homes. Insects, microscopic plants, fish, and trees use their own form of “antifreeze.” Small fractions of degrees of temperature change are sensed by the built-​in thermometers of some snakes, mosquitoes, mallee birds, and brush turkeys. Hornets, wasps, and yellow jackets make paper. Sponges, fungi, bacteria, glowworms, insects, fish​—all produce cold light, often in color. Many migrating birds apparently have in their heads compasses, maps, and biological clocks. Water beetles and spiders use scuba gear and diving bells.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—See illustrations on page 15.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">To come up with all this design and instinctive wisdom demands an intelligence far beyond man’s. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:24-20:30:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:24</a>) But some of the most amazing examples are to be found in the world of the infinitely small​—where evolutionists hoped to see the simple beginning of life to start evolution on its upward climb to the obviously complex designs everywhere—​including us. Simple beginning? No such thing! Consider the complexities reflecting intelligent design in the tiniest cells.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><em>The New Biology </em>says on page 30: “The average cell carries out hundreds of chemical reactions every second and can reproduce itself every twenty minutes or so. Yet all this occurs on such a tiny scale: over 500 bacteria could fit into the area occupied by the period at the end of this sentence. [Biologist François] Jacob marvels at the minute laboratory of the bacterial cell, which ‘carries out some two thousand distinct reactions with incomparable skill, in the smallest space imaginable. These two thousand reactions diverge and converge at top speed, without ever becoming tangled.’”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>The Center of Life​—A Natural History of the Cell, </em>by L. L. Larison Cudmore, says on pages 13, 14: “Just a single cell could make weapons, catch food, digest it, get rid of wastes, move around, build houses, engage in sexual activity straightforward or bizarre. These creatures are still around. The protists​—organisms complete and entire, yet made up of just a single cell with many talents, but with no tissues, no organs, no hearts and no minds—​really have everything we’ve got.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>The Blind Watchmaker, </em>by Richard Dawkins, on page 116 comments on the amount of information stored in a single cell: “There is enough storage capacity in the DNA of a single lily seed or a single salamander sperm to store the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica </em>60 times over. Some species of the unjustly called ‘primitive’ amoebas have as much information in their DNA as 1,000 <em>Encyclopædia Britannicas.”</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Molecular biologist Michael Denton writes in <em>Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, </em>page 250: “Molecular biology has shown that even the <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>simplest of all living systems on earth today, bacterial cells, are exceedingly complex objects. Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, weighing less than [one trillionth of a gram], each is in effect a veritable micro-​miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up altogether of one hundred thousand million atoms, far more complicated than any machine built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-​living world.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“Molecular biology has also shown that the basic design of the cell system is essentially the same in all living systems on earth from bacteria to mammals. In all organisms the roles of DNA, mRNA and protein are identical. The meaning of the genetic code is also virtually identical in all cells. The size, structure and component design of the protein synthetic machinery is practically the same in all cells. In terms of their basic biochemical design, therefore no living system can be thought of as being primitive or ancestral with respect to any other system, nor is there the slightest empirical hint of an evolutionary sequence among all the incredibly diverse cells on earth.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">George Greenstein acknowledges all this intelligence involved in the earth’s structure. In his book <em>The Symbiotic Universe, </em>he speaks of the mysterious and incredible series of coincidences that are beyond explaining, coincidences without which life on earth would be impossible. The following statements, appearing throughout pages 21-8, reflect his agonizing over conditions that bespeak the need for an intelligent and purposeful God:</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“I believe that we are faced with a mystery​—a great and profound mystery, and one of immense significance: the mystery of the habitability of the cosmos, of the fitness of the environment.” He sets out “to detail what can only seem to be an astonishing sequence of stupendous and unlikely accidents that paved the way for life’s emergence.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> There is a list of coincidences, all of them essential to our existence.” Yet “the list kept getting longer . . . So many coincidences! The more I read, the more I became convinced that such ‘coincidences’ could hardly have happened by chance.” A shattering fact for an evolutionist to face up to, as he next acknowledges:</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">“But as this conviction grew, something else grew as well. Even now it is difficult to express this ‘something’ in words. It was an intense revulsion, and at times it was almost physical in nature. I would positively squirm with discomfort. The very thought that the fitness of the cosmos for life might be a mystery requiring solution struck me as ludicrous, absurd. I found it difficult to entertain the notion without grimacing in disgust . . . Nor has this reaction faded over the years: I have had to struggle against it incessantly during the writing of this book. I am sure that the same reaction is at work within every other scientist, and that it is this which accounts for the widespread indifference accorded the idea at present. And more than that: I now believe that what appears as indifference in fact masks an intense antagonism.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">What antagonism? Antagonism to the thought that the explanation might lie in a purposeful Creator. As Greenstein expresses <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>it: “As we survey all the evidence, the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency​—or, rather, Agency—​must be involved. Is it possible that suddenly, without intending to, we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a Supreme Being? Was it God who stepped in and so providentially drafted the cosmos for our benefit?” But Greenstein recovers from such heretical thinking and reasserts his orthodoxy to the evolutionary religion, reciting one of their creedal dogmas: “God is not an explanation.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Astrophysicist Fred Hoyle in his book <em>The Intelligent Universe, </em>on page 9, talks about those, like Greenstein, who fear God’s entering the picture: “Orthodox scientists are more concerned with preventing a return to the religious excesses of the past than in looking forward to the truth [and this concern] has dominated scientific thought throughout the past century.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In his book he then discusses these same mysterious features that trouble Greenstein. “Such properties,” he says, “seem to run through the fabric of the natural world like a thread of happy accidents. But there are so many of these odd coincidences essential to life that some explanation seems required to account for them.” Both Hoyle and Greenstein say chance cannot explain these many “accidental coincidences.” Hoyle then says that to account for them, ‘the origin of the universe requires an intelligence,’ an ‘intelligence on a higher plane,’ ‘an intelligence that preceded us and that led to a deliberate act of creation of structures suitable for life.’</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">None of this is to be taken as saying that Hoyle is thinking of the God of the Bible, but he does see that behind the universe and the earth and life on it, there must be a tremendous supernatural intelligence. While he does say that “‘God’ is a forbidden word in science,” he allows that we might “define an intelligence superior to ourselves as a deity.” He speculates that “through our own minds’ pre-​programmed condition,” there might be “a connecting chain of intelligence, extending downward . . . to humans upon the Earth.”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“There are plenty of indications,” he says, “that this might be so. The restlessness within us is one such hint. It is as if we have an instinctive perception that there is something important for us to carry out. The restlessness comes because we have not been able to discover as yet exactly what its nature is.” Elsewhere he says: “The religious impulse appears to be unique to man . . . Stripped of the many fanciful adornments with which religion has become traditionally surrounded, does it not amount to an instruction within us that expressed rather simply might read as follows: You are derived from something ‘out there’ in the sky. Seek it, and you will find much more than you expect.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Man is groping. What he gropes for without realizing it is the Biblical truth that we are created in the image and likeness of God, meaning we have a measure of such attributes of God as wisdom, love, power, justice, purpose, and other qualities that account for the great gulf between people and animals. Our minds are preprogrammed for such divine attributes and for the true worship of God. Until these several attributes are in proper balance and a connection is made with God through prayer and his true worship, the restlessness will remain. When these spiritual needs we were created with are fulfilled, the restlessness will give way to “the peace of God <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>that excels all thought.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:7-50:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Genesis 1:26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:27, 28</a> recommends this groping, namely, “for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us. For by him we have life and move and exist.” It is by him, the Creator of the universe, including earth and us upon it, that we live and move and exist. Shedding the adornments and false doctrines of orthodox religions​—which religions have turned millions away from God, including many scientists—​and following the true worship of Jehovah God, we will gain life everlasting in a paradise earth, which was Jehovah’s purpose in creating the earth in the first place.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 45:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">It takes tremendous credulity to think that intelligence of this magnitude resides in blind, brainless chance. It is a faith comparable to that of the pagan religionists of the prophet Isaiah’s time: “But you men are those leaving Jehovah, those forgetting my holy mountain, those setting in order a table for the god of Good Luck and those filling up mixed wine for the god of Destiny.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:11-23:65:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:11</a>) Evolutionists look to millions of “lucky” chances to produce man from rock, but they haven’t got off the ground to reach the first rung of their evolutionary ladder. Their “god of Good Luck” is a bruised reed.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Fred Hoyle feels an ominous foreboding in all of this: “Another point nagging me is a conviction that the window of opportunity for the human species may be very narrow in time. High technology is necessary to open the window, but high technology on its own, without establishing a relation between our species to the world outside the Earth, may well be a path to self-​destruction. If on occasions in this book my opposition to the Darwinian theory has seemed fierce, it is because of my feeling that a society oriented by that theory is very likely set upon a self-​destruct course.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Alice, in the tale <em>Through the Looking-​Glass, </em>incredulous at the strange logic of the White Queen, could only laugh. “There’s no use trying,” she said. “One can’t believe impossible things.” The queen responded: “I dare say you haven’t had much practice. When I was your age I did it for half an hour a day. Why sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Evolutionists are the White Queens of today. They have had infinite practice in believing impossible things.</p>

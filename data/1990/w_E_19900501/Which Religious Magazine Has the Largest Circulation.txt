Which Religious Magazine Has the Largest Circulation?
The Watchtower! Now almost 14 million copies of each issue of this magazine are printed in over a hundred languages. You can receive The Watchtower in any one of the languages listed on page 2. If you wish to receive The Watchtower, two issues a month for one year, simply fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
This is part of a worldwide Bible educational work that is supported by voluntary donations.
I would like to have The Watchtower delivered to my home for one year. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

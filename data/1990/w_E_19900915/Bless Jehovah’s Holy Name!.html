<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. If Jehovah’s kingship is dear to us, what will we do?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah’s rulership was of great concern to David, who said: <em>“About the glory of your kingship they will talk, and about your mightiness they will speak,</em> <em>to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glory of the splendor of his kingship.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:11-19:145:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 145:11, 12</a>) People talk about things that interest them. So a man speaks of his family, his home, his crops. “A good man brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart,” said Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>) If God’s rulership is dear to our heart, we will pray for his Kingdom to come, and we will tell others about the justice, peace, and righteousness that will prevail under its rule. We will praise Jehovah as the “King of eternity,” and we will speak about the expression of his sovereignty through the Messianic Kingdom in the hands of his dear Son, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 15:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>) What a privilege it is to speak about the heavenly glory of Jehovah’s kingship, which will soon be reflected in the beauty of an earthly paradise filled with perfectly happy creatures!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Appreciation will also move us to speak about Jehovah’s “mightiness.” Though “he is exalted in power,” he never misuses it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 37:23</a>) He used his power to create the earth and mankind and will exercise it to destroy the wicked. We have occasion to speak about God’s mightiness when we declare the good news. And are we not grateful that this ultimate Source of strength empowers us to do this work? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>) Yes, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are sustained in sacred service by God’s strength and spirit.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. Since multitudes do not know about Jehovah’s “mighty acts,” what should we do?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>There is a need for us to make known to the sons of men the “mighty acts” of Jehovah, even as the Israelites told their children about the way God delivered them <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>from Egyptian bondage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:14-2:13:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 13:14-16</a>) Men build monuments to humans whose deeds they consider notable, but how many know about the mighty acts of God? As one scholar put it: “They inscribe the deeds of their heroes upon brass, but the glorious acts of Jehovah are written upon the sand, and the tide of time washes them from present memory.” Those acts are not really washed away, though they are unknown to multitudes. So in our house-to-house work, when conducting home Bible studies, and on other occasions, let us zealously speak of God’s mighty acts.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. (a) On what occasion years ago was the zealous spirit with which we carry out our ministry well expressed? (b) In essence, what was said in 1922 about advertising the Kingdom?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>We should also zealously make known the glory of God’s kingship. Zeal for such Kingdom service surely was evident when, in 1922, J. F. Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society, addressed conventioners at Cedar Point, Ohio, and said: “Since 1914 the King of glory has taken his power . . . The kingdom of heaven is at hand; the King reigns; Satan’s empire is falling; millions now living will never die. Do you believe it? . . . Then back to the field, O ye sons of the most high God! Gird on your armor! Be sober, be vigilant, be active, be brave. Be faithful and true witnesses for the Lord. Go forward in the fight until every vestige of Babylon lies desolate. Herald the message far and wide. The world must know that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords. This is the day of all days. Behold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. How should we feel about our activity as Kingdom proclaimers?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>What a joy to ‘think upon God’s name,’ to tell others about his rulership, and to advertise the Messianic Kingdom of his dear Son! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Malachi 3:16</a>) As Kingdom proclaimers and advocates, we cherish our privilege of declaring the good news and turning the hearts of others toward God, Christ, and the Kingdom. Within us, there should be a burning desire to tell others about the glorious splendor of Jehovah’s kingship.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:9-24:20:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 20:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8. (a) In what is Jehovah’s rulership represented today? (b) Why can it be said that God has dominion “throughout all successive generations”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>We should be moved to announce God’s Kingdom with great zeal, for David next said: <em>“Your kingship is a kingship for all times indefinite, and your dominion is throughout all successive generations.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:13-19:145:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 145:13</a>) As the psalmist’s meditations on Jehovah’s kingship continued, he changed pronouns from “his” to “your,” addressing his prayerful words directly to <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>God. Of course, Jehovah’s rulership as represented in the Messianic Kingdom does not replace God’s eternal kingship. In fact, when obedient mankind has been uplifted to perfection, Christ will hand the Kingdom over to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</a>) So God does have dominion “throughout all successive generations.” Jehovah was King when Adam was created and will have dominion over righteous humans forever.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In this acrostic psalm, the Masoretic text omits a verse starting with the Hebrew letter <em>nun. </em>But in accord with the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>the Syriac <em>Peshitta, </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>one Hebrew manuscript reads: “Jehovah is faithful in all his words, and lovingly kind [or, “loyal”] in all his works.” (<em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References, </em>footnote) God fulfills all of his promises and is loyal, loving, and kind to all who appreciate his goodness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah’s Support Never Fails</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. How does God ‘give us support’?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The King Eternal never ignores the plight of his servants. Thus, David could say: <em>“Jehovah is giving support to all who are falling, and is raising up all who are bowed down.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:14-19:145:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 145:14</a>) Since the days of Abel, Jehovah has supported His worshipers. Left to ourselves, we would fall many times under our burdens. We lack sufficient strength to bear all of life’s woes and the persecution that comes our way as God’s people, but Jehovah upholds us. The form of the Hebrew verb used here indicates that God continuously ‘gives us support.’ It may be noted that John the Baptizer and God’s own Son helped to raise up fallen sinners morally. When these individuals repented and became Jehovah’s servants, they enjoyed the wonderful blessing of divine support.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:28-40:21:32" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 21:28-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:15-41:2:17" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Mark 2:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. In what way does Jehovah ‘raise up all who are bowed down’?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>It is comforting to know that ‘Jehovah is raising up all who are bowed down’ by various trials. He cheers the despondent among us, comforts our grieving ones, and helps us to speak his word boldly when we are persecuted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:29-44:4:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 4:29-31</a>) Never does he allow our burdens to crush us if only we accept his help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) So, like the “daughter of Abraham” who was “bent double” but was physically cured by Jesus, we should “glorify God” when he lovingly raises us up spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:10-42:13:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 13:10-17</a>) Anointed ones bowed down in Babylonish bondage were grateful when God raised them up in 1919, and he has been raising up appreciative “other sheep” since 1935.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12. How is it that “the eyes of all look hopefully” to God?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jehovah never fails his people, as David next made clear by saying: <em>“To you the eyes of all look hopefully, and you are giving them their food in its season.</em> <em>You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:15-19:145:16" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 145:15, 16</a>) It is as though the eyes of all living creatures are turned in hope to the Universal Sovereign. The angels look to God for continued life. And as a child looks to a parent for things needed, we look to our heavenly Father. In fact, from him humans and animals alike receive sustenance. No one else can satisfy their needs. God gives them “their food in its season,” that is, when it is needed.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13. In what ways does Jehovah ‘open his hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing’?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>God ‘opens his hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:10-19:104:28" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 104:10-28</a>) True, some animals die for lack of food. Many humans hunger as victims of <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>selfishness, oppression, and misuse of resources. Moreover, Jesus foretold that “food shortages” would be a feature of “the sign” of his presence in these last days.

Think of the thousands of millions of creatures that are sustained! Moreover, this psalm provides assurance that under Kingdom rule, when ‘man does not dominate man to his injury,’ God will satisfy our material and spiritual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Isaiah 25:6</a>) Even today, we need not hunger for spiritual food, for God provides it abundantly in its season through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:2</a>) Spiritually speaking, Jehovah’s Witnesses are the best-fed people on earth.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19. Why do our mouths speak “the praise of Jehovah”?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>David concludes this moving psalm with the words: <em>“The praise of Jehovah my mouth will speak; and let all flesh bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:21-19:145:21" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 145:21</a>) As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we appreciate God’s greatness, goodness, benevolent kingship, unfailing support, and tireless watchcare. So, like David, our mouths speak the praises of God. We are moved to give him exclusive devotion, thank him for his many blessings, and praise his “beauteous name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:10-13:29:13" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:6" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Exodus 20:4-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Since Jehovah blesses us daily, let us regularly bless him, or speak well of him. Let us preach the good news zealously in praise of God, telling others that soon ‘all flesh will bless his holy name.’ How splendid it will be to live when all inhabitants of the earth​—indeed, all intelligent creatures in the universe—​will sing praises to our heavenly Father!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:2-42:11:2" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Luke 11:2</a>) Let us serve God loyally, so that in his new system, our voice may be heard in the chorus of those who bless Jehovah’s holy name forever.</p>

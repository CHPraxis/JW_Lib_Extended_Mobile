Conduct That Adorns the Teaching of God
Recently, the management of a company in Caracas, Venezuela, addressed a letter to the elders and ministerial servants of a nearby congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In it they wrote: “We have received very good references about the people in your religion regarding their sense of responsibility and honesty. It is for this reason that we now approach you. Because of our present lack of personnel, we are in urgent need of two persons to fill the following positions: one to be a driver and the other to be our warehouse manager. We would very much appreciate any information you could provide with regard to someone in your congregation or in one nearby. We really do not desire to hire non-Witness personnel. Please, let us know even if there is no one available, since we will wait for your response before making any decision.”
After finding the letter under the Kingdom Hall door, one of the congregation elders visited the owner of the company in question. The owner had had dealings with Jehovah’s Witnesses for 15 years and recalled having no serious problems with his Witness employees. He referred to them as serious, responsible, honest, and diligent workers. Then he added: “I know that you do not tolerate evildoers, and you disfellowship them. That shows that your congregation does not want to become an accomplice with such ones.”
Such conduct adorns the teaching of God. (Titus 2:10) It is the result of a genuine desire to adhere closely to the moral principles outlined in the Bible.

Our Third Consecutive Publisher Peak!
825,279 Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers in April
Our third publisher peak in as many months affords a solid reason for rejoicing. Total publishers in April was 20,761 more than those reporting in April one year ago and 3,927 over the March 1990 report.
The April report also shows a new peak in the number of home Bible studies being conducted. The 573,544 studies reported this April represent an increase of 300 over April of last year.
May we continue to keep Jehovah’s commandments and observe the direction given through his organization so as to see further increase.​—Acts 16:4, 5.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We are sure you have your own share of problems. Everyone has. At school or at work, you may face interesting problems that challenge you. Other problems are more painful, though. If you are poor, just getting enough to eat can be a continuing challenge. Sickness in the family makes matters worse. Unhappy marriages, prejudice, unfair practices, political unrest, and economic uncertainty make life more difficult.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Can such problems be solved? That is the subject of this publication. The question is discussed in conversations between two families. The conversations and the families are fictional. But the problems discussed are real, and the solutions arrived at really work. If you study and apply what this publication says, the information will truly change your life for the better. There are questions on page 30 that can be used to review the material.</p>

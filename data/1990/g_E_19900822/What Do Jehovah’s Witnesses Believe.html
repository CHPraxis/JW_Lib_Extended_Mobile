<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Community leaders in first-century Rome told the Christian apostle Paul: “We think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:22-44:28:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 28:22</a>) Those people wanted to hear from the source, rather than from outside critics alone.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses also are often spoken against, and it would be a mistake to expect to learn the truth about them from prejudiced sources. So we are pleased to offer the 32-page brochure <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, </em>which describes the beliefs and the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses. If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I would like to receive the 32-page brochure <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)</p>

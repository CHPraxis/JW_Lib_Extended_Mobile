What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?
Community leaders in first-century Rome told the Christian apostle Paul: “We think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.” (Acts 28:22) Those people wanted to hear from the source, rather than from outside critics alone.
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses also are often spoken against, and it would be a mistake to expect to learn the truth about them from prejudiced sources. So we are pleased to offer the 32-page brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, which describes the beliefs and the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses. If you wish to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the accompanying coupon.
I would like to receive the 32-page brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 4.)

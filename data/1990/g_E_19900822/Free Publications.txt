Free Publications
FREE newspapers in Britain generate an advertising revenue of several hundred million dollars from a circulation of tens of millions of copies per week. The results are a far cry from the scornful predictions with which they were greeted more than 20 years ago. “People pooh-poohed the idea that you could advertise in something that was free,” observed Ian Locks, executive director of the Association of Free Newspapers. But, in fact, “it has opened up a whole range of free newspapers, magazines and leaflets as a new genre of marketing opportunities,” he added.
Magazines too? Yes. Over 400 different magazines are given away in the United Kingdom, also with a circulation of tens of millions. Cut-rate prices have attracted advertisers from the traditional local newspapers, many of which are no more or are now themselves given away free. The Times of London describes the phenomenon as “a dynamic new force in Britain’s publishing industry,” one that is here to stay.

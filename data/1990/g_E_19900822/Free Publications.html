<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FREE newspapers in Britain generate an advertising revenue of several hundred million dollars from a circulation of tens of millions of copies per week. The results are a far cry from the scornful predictions with which they were greeted more than 20 years ago. “People pooh-poohed the idea that you could advertise in something that was free,” observed Ian Locks, executive director of the Association of Free Newspapers. But, in fact, “it has opened up a whole range of free newspapers, magazines and leaflets as a new genre of marketing opportunities,” he added.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Magazines too? Yes. Over 400 different magazines are given away in the United Kingdom, also with a circulation of tens of millions. Cut-rate prices have attracted advertisers from the traditional local newspapers, many of which are no more or are now themselves given away free. <em>The Times </em>of London describes the phenomenon as “a dynamic new force in Britain’s publishing industry,” one that is here to stay.</p>

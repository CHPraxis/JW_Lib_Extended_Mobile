<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A member of a Protestant congregation in Puerto Rico wrote the Watch Tower Society: “I am a teacher of children in a Bible school. During the past year, the following happened to me.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The books that I was using to teach the children Bible history were completed, so I asked myself: ‘What do I do now?’ As I looked through the shelves in my room where I have about a hundred books, I saw a yellow one entitled <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I decided to use this book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I brushed off the dust and began to use it each Sunday in my teaching. The children were delighted with the book, and we had barely finished one chapter when they wanted to start another. The result: The year finished, and we had covered the entire book. The children were very happy, and I am very grateful. It is truly a beautiful book, clear and precise.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We feel that you too will treasure this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. These stories appear in the order in which the events occurred. You will find this really helpful in learning when, in relation to other events, things happened.

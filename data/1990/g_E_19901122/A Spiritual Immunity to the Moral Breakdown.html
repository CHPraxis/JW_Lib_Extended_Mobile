<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">OUR physical organism is besieged by millions of microbes clamoring to get inside of us and conquer us. Fortunately, we have waiting within us millions of defenders poised to pounce on them and defeat them first. Their response to the invaders is automatic; we need give them no thought. There is, however, another kind of invasion that we must give much thought to if we are to survive. It too is life-threatening, and there are forces behind it that are even more invisible than disease-causing microorganisms!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These forces attack the mind and the heart, the thinking and the feelings. Their visible manifestations cater to the flesh and starve the needs and joys of the spirit. In subtle and in flagrant ways, the masses of humanity are hustled along in the ever-expanding moral <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>breakdown that plagues this generation. As there is a physical immune system to ward off the invasion of our bodies by microbes and viruses, is there a means of immunity to rescue our spirituality from its destroyers? Yes, there is!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What can provide the spiritual antibodies powerful enough to provide spiritual immunity to the moral breakdown? Obviously, neither the rash of pop psychology best-sellers nor the weightier tomes of psychiatrists can do it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One syndicated columnist reaches to a higher source for help: “It is impossible to have a moral community or nation without faith in God, because everything rapidly comes down to ‘me,’ and ‘me’ alone is meaningless.” When the Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was asked to identify the problem of the 20th century, he said: “Men have forgotten God. . . . The entire twentieth century is being sucked into the vortex of atheism and self-destruction.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One of the pioneers of modern psychiatry, Dr. C. G. Jung, expressed the essential ingredient for successfully resisting moral decay: “The individual who is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the physical and moral blandishments of the world. For this he needs the evidence of inner, transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise inevitable submersion in the mass. Merely intellectual or even moral insight . . . lacks the driving force of religious conviction, since it is merely rational.”​—<em>The Undiscovered Self, </em>page 34.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Only the Bible, when it is applied in our daily conduct, provides the spiritual antibodies powerful enough to protect mind and heart from the diseased antigens surrounding us and spewed out by the froglike croakings of “unclean inspired expressions” that would lead us into conflict with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 16:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:1-62:4:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:1</a>.</p>

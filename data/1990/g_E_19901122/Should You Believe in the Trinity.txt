Should You Believe in the Trinity?
Ian Boyne, the religion writer for The Sunday Gleaner, Jamaica, West Indies, discussed a recent brochure published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, saying in part:
“The Witnesses deserve an ‘A’ for this document which, though so simply written that a teenager can read it, is laced​—without exaggeration—​with quotations from reputable scholars and sources. . . . The publication of Should You Believe in the Trinity? is a masterstroke of the Witnesses, and now no Trinitarian​—or binatarian—​is safe. The booklet piles quotation upon quotation from historical and theological sources to show that the Trinity doctrine was not derived from the Bible. It quotes the authoritative Encyclopedia of Religion as saying, ‘Theologians agree that the New Testament also does not contain an explicit doctrine of the Trinity.’”
Boyne also observes: “It is most difficult for this religion writer to see how the average​—or even above average church member—​can answer the compelling and commanding arguments marshalled by the Witnesses against the view that Jesus is God.”

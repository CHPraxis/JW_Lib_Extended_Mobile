<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Ian Boyne, the religion writer for <em>The Sunday Gleaner, </em>Jamaica, West Indies, discussed a recent brochure published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, saying in part:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The Witnesses deserve an ‘A’ for this document which, though so simply written that a teenager can read it, is laced​—without exaggeration—​with quotations from reputable scholars and sources. . . . The publication of <em>Should You Believe in the Trinity? </em>is a masterstroke of the Witnesses, and now no Trinitarian​—or binatarian—​is safe. The booklet piles quotation upon quotation from historical and theological sources to show that the Trinity doctrine was not derived from the Bible. It quotes the authoritative <em>Encyclopedia of Religion </em>as saying, ‘Theologians agree that the New Testament also does not contain an explicit doctrine of the Trinity.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Boyne also observes: “It is most difficult for this religion writer to see how the average​—or even above average church member—​can answer the compelling and commanding arguments marshalled by the Witnesses against the view that Jesus is God.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Just as in the past, holiness is a divine requirement for God’s servants today. A pressing need thus exists for each of us to understand clearly not only what holiness is but also how and why it should characterize our worship of Jehovah. To this end, “Become Holy in All Your Conduct” is the theme discussed in the special assembly day program for the 1991 service year.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Since Jehovah’s righteous principles and laws originate with him as the Holy God, the righteous standing we enjoy is a direct result of our close, personal relationship with him. Consequently, the program will develop a number of ways to show how we can improve our relationship with God. These involve obedience to his holy standards, even in what might be considered little things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>) We will be helped to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Jehovah’s holy requirements and be reminded why these should influence all our thinking, attitudes, and ways.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Two principal discourses to be developed will be “Submitting to Being Progressively Cleansed” and “Expanding Activities of Jehovah’s Holy People.” As exciting world happenings daily impress upon our minds the urgency of our times, the special assembly day program for the new service year will motivate us to continue looking to Jehovah for direction and seeking to be well pleasing to him by conducting ourselves in holiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:14-60:1:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:16-60:1:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

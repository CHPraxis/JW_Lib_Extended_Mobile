This Book Changed Their Lives
Years ago a woman obtained a divorce from her husband. Eventually her son Steve became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Steve tried without success to talk with his mother about his beliefs. He also went to see his father, who was dying of cancer.
Instead of talking a lot, Steve simply left the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth beside his father’s bed and said that reading it would help him. His father read the book and on his own began attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses in January 1988.
In the meantime, Steve’s mother had opportunities at family gatherings to observe the new personality displayed by her ex-husband. This impressed her so much that she agreed to attend a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She began attending meetings regularly, and soon she was sitting at them with her former husband. Eventually they remarried.
Steve’s father died in September 1988 but not before he began sharing in the Christian ministry. Steve’s mother, who cared for his father during the final months of his illness, was baptized in June 1988 and is now a zealous Witness.

The Best Time of Life
A youth from Nigeria, West Africa, recently wrote: “Before, I thought that the time of youth was the hardest time of a person’s life and that the happiest age is the age when a person is a father or a mother or when he is an adult.”
But then this African youth received a copy of the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. “Thank you so much,” he wrote. “This book has helped me in so many ways.” He concluded: “Now, after reading this book, I realize that youth is the best age.”
Youths growing up in these troubled times face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should a youth smoke or accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? What about masturbation and homosexuality?
Wrong decisions may lead to all sorts of heartaches and troubles. Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It considers all the above questions and many more. If you would like to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.
I would like to receive the 192-page hardcover book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)

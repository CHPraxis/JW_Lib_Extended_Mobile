<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A youth from Nigeria, West Africa, recently wrote: “Before, I thought that the time of youth was the hardest time of a person’s life and that the happiest age is the age when a person is a father or a mother or when he is an adult.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But then this African youth received a copy of the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>“Thank you so much,” he wrote. “This book has helped me in so many ways.” He concluded: “Now, after reading this book, I realize that youth is the best age.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Youths growing up in these troubled times face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Should a youth smoke or accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex? What about masturbation and homosexuality?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Wrong decisions may lead to all sorts of heartaches and troubles. <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>considers all the above questions and many more. If you would like to receive a copy, please fill in and mail the coupon.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I would like to receive the 192-page hardcover book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information. See page 2.)</p>

It Will Hold Your Attention
One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Portland, Oregon, wrote regarding the effect that a Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses had on a visitor.
“A service repairman came to my home,” she said, “to fix my washer. He had gone to another room in the house, and for about 20 minutes, he was real quiet. Finally, he came out into the kitchen and asked, ‘Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?’ He had picked up the Yearbook and had it in his hand. He said, ‘This is really wonderful. I want to give you a dollar. Please send one to my address.’”
Many have found the 1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be absorbing reading. It contains faith-​strengthening reports about the modern beginning and development of the Kingdom-preaching activity in Finland, Colombia, and Suriname. A copy will be mailed to you for a contribution of just $1.
Please send, postpaid, the 1990 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

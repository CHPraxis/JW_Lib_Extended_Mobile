<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"> 1. What does Job’s name mean, and what questions does the book of Job answer?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>ONE of the oldest books of the inspired Scriptures! A book that is held in the highest esteem and that is often quoted, yet one that is little understood by mankind. Why was this book written, and what value does it have for us today? The answer is indicated in the meaning of Job’s name: “Object of Hostility.” Yes, this book takes up two important questions: Why do the innocent suffer? Why does God permit wickedness in the earth? We have the record of Job’s suffering and his great endurance for our consideration in answering these questions. It has all been written down, just as Job requested.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:23-18:19:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 19:23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"> 2. What proves that Job was a real person?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Job has become synonymous with patience and endurance. But was there such a person as Job? In spite of all the efforts of the Devil to remove this sterling example of integrity from the pages of history, the answer is clear. Job was an actual person! Jehovah names him along with His witnesses Noah and Daniel, whose existence was accepted by Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 14:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:20-26:14:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:37" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 37</a>.) The ancient Hebrew nation regarded Job as a real person. The Christian writer James points to Job’s example of endurance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>) Only a true-life example, not a fictitious one, would carry weight, convincing worshipers of God that integrity can be maintained under all circumstances. Moreover, the intensity and feeling of the speeches recorded in Job testify to the reality of the situation.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 3. What evidence testifies to the inspiration of the book of Job?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> That the book of Job is authentic and inspired is also proved in that the ancient Hebrews always included it in their Bible canon, a fact remarkable in that Job himself was not an Israelite. In addition to the references by Ezekiel and James, the book is quoted by the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:5:13-18:5:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 5:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:19</a>) Powerful proof of the book’s inspiration is given in its amazing harmony with the proved facts of the sciences. How could it be known that Jehovah is “hanging the earth upon nothing,” when the ancients had the most fantastic notions as to how the earth was supported? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:26:7-18:26:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>) One view held in ancient times was that the earth was supported by elephants standing on a large sea turtle. Why does the book of Job not reflect such nonsense? Obviously because Jehovah the Creator supplied the truth by inspiration. The many other descriptions of the earth and its wonders and of the wild animals and birds in their natural habitats are so accurate that only Jehovah God could be the Author and Inspirer of the book of Job.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 4. Where and when was the drama enacted, and by when was the writing of the book of Job completed?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Job lived in Uz, located, according to some geographers, in northern Arabia near the land occupied by the Edomites and east of the land promised to Abraham’s offspring. The Sabeans were on the south, the Chaldeans on the east. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:3-18:1:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:15-18:1:15" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:17-18:1:17" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 17</a>) The time of Job’s trial was long after Abraham’s day. It was at a time when there was “no one like [Job] in the earth, a man blameless and upright.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1:8</a>) This appears to be the period between the death of Joseph (1657 B.C.E.), a man of outstanding faith, and the time that Moses entered upon his course of integrity. Job excelled in pure worship at this period of Israel’s contamination by the demon worship of Egypt. Furthermore, the practices mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">the first chapter of Job</a>, and God’s acceptance of Job as a true worshiper, point to patriarchal times rather than to the later period from 1513 B.C.E. on, when God dealt exclusively with Israel under the Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:2-30:3:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Amos 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:12-49:2:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:12</a>) Thus, allowing for Job’s long life, it appears that the book covers a period between 1657 B.C.E. and 1473 B.C.E., the year of Moses’ death; the book was completed by Moses sometime after Job’s death and while the Israelites were in the wilderness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:16-18:42:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 42:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu"> 5. What indicates Moses’ writership of Job?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Why do we say Moses was the writer? This is according to the oldest tradition, among both Jewish and early Christian scholars. The vigorous <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>authentic style of Hebrew poetry used in the book of Job makes it evident that it was an original composition in Hebrew, the language of Moses. It could not have been a translation from another language such as Arabic. Also, the portions in prose bear stronger resemblance to the Pentateuch than to any other writings in the Bible. The writer must have been an Israelite, as Moses was, because the Jews “were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:1-45:3:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 3:1, 2</a>) After he had reached maturity, Moses spent 40 years in Midian, not far from Uz, where he could obtain the detailed information recorded in Job. Later, when he passed near Job’s homeland during Israel’s 40-year wilderness journey, Moses could learn of and record the concluding details in the book.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu"> 6. In what respects is the book of Job much more than a literary masterpiece?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> According to <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> the book of Job often is “counted among the masterpieces of world literature.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> However, the book is much more than a literary masterpiece. Job is outstanding among the books of the Bible in exalting Jehovah’s power, justice, wisdom, and love. It reveals most clearly the primary issue before the universe. It illuminates much that is said in other books of the Bible, especially Genesis, Exodus, Ecclesiastes, Luke, Romans, and Revelation. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:7" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:16-2:9:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Exodus 9:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:31-42:22:32" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Luke 22:31, 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:16-45:9:19" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Romans 9:16-19 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>; also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:21-18:1:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:24:15-18:24:15" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 24:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:21:23-18:21:26" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 21:23-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:28-18:28:28" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 28:28</a> respectively with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:15-21:5:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:11-21:8:11" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 8:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:2-21:9:3" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 9:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 12:13</a>.) It provides the answers to many of life’s questions. It is certainly an integral part of the inspired Word of God, to which it contributes much in the way of beneficial understanding.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS OF JOB</strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 7. In what situation do we find Job as the book opens?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> <strong>Prologue to</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>the book of Job</strong> (1:1-5</a>). This introduces us to Job, a man “blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” Job is happy, having seven sons and three daughters. He is a materially rich landholder with numerous flocks and herds. He has many servants and is “the greatest of all the Orientals.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:3-18:1:3" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 3</a>) However, he is not materialistic, for he does not put his trust in his material possessions. He is also rich spiritually, rich in good works, willing at all times to help someone afflicted or in distress, or to give a garment to anyone needing it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:12-18:29:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">29:12-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:19-18:31:20" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 31:19, 20</a>) All respect him. Job worships the true God, Jehovah. He refuses to bow down to the sun, moon, and stars as did the pagan nations, but he is faithful to Jehovah, keeping integrity to his God and enjoying a close relationship with Him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:7-18:29:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">29:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:21-18:29:25" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 21-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:26-18:31:27" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 31:26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:4-18:29:4" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 29:4</a>) Job serves as priest for his family, offering up burnt sacrifices regularly, in case they have sinned.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 8. (a) How does Satan come to challenge Job’s integrity? (b) How does Jehovah accept the challenge?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> <strong>Satan challenges God</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:2:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1:6–2:13</a>). Marvelously the curtain of invisibility is drawn back so that we can get a view of heavenly things. Jehovah is seen presiding over an assembly of the sons of God. Satan also appears among them. Jehovah calls attention to his faithful servant Job, but Satan challenges Job’s integrity, charging that Job serves God because of material benefits received. If God will allow Satan to take these away, Job will turn away from his integrity. Jehovah accepts the challenge, with the restriction that Satan must not touch Job himself.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 9. (a) What severe tests befall Job? (b) What proves that he keeps integrity?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Many calamities start to befall the unsuspecting Job. Raids by Sabeans and Chaldeans remove his great riches. A storm kills his sons and daughters. This severe test fails to make Job curse God or turn away from him. Rather, he says, “Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:21-18:1:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1:21</a>) Satan, defeated and proved a liar on this count, appears again before Jehovah and charges: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:4-18:2:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2:4</a>) Satan claims that if he was permitted to touch Job’s body, he could make Job curse God to his face. With permission to do everything short of taking Job’s life, Satan strikes Job with a dreadful disease. His flesh becomes “clothed with maggots and lumps of dust,” and his body and breath become foul-smelling to his wife and relatives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:5-18:7:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">7:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:13-18:19:20" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Indicating that Job has not broken his integrity, his wife urges him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” Job rebukes her and does not “sin with his lips.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:9-18:2:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">10. What silent “comfort” does Satan provide?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Satan now raises up three companions, who come to “comfort” Job. They are Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. At a distance they do not recognize Job, but then they proceed to raise their voices and weep and toss dust on their heads. Next, they sit before him on the earth without speaking a word. After seven days and nights of this silent “comfort,” Job finally breaks silence in opening a lengthy debate with his would-be sympathizers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">11-13. How does Job open the debate, what accusation does Eliphaz make, and what is Job’s spirited reply?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> <strong>The debate: round one</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:1-18:14:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">3:1–14:22</a>). From <span id="page97" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="97" data-before-text="97"></span>this point on, the drama unfolds in sublime Hebrew poetry. Job calls down evil on the day of his birth and wonders why God has permitted him to go on living.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> In response, Eliphaz accuses Job of lacking integrity. The upright have never perished, he declares. He recalls a night vision in which a voice told him that God has no faith in his servants, especially those of mere clay, the dust of the earth. He indicates that Job’s suffering is a discipline from Almighty God.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Job spiritedly replies to Eliphaz. He cries out as any creature would who was undergoing persecution and distress. Death would be a relief. He upbraids his companions for scheming against him and protests: “Instruct me, and I, for my part, shall be silent; and what mistake I have committed make me understand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:24-18:6:24" data-bid="28-1" class="b">6:24</a>) Job contends for his own righteousness before God, “the Observer of mankind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:20-18:7:20" data-bid="29-1" class="b">7:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">14, 15. What is Bildad’s argument, and why does Job fear he will lose his case with God?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Bildad now voices his argument, implying that Job’s sons have sinned and that Job himself is not upright, otherwise he would be heard by God. He instructs Job to look to the former generations and to the things searched out by their forefathers as a guide.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Job replies, maintaining God is not unjust. Neither does God have to account to man, for He is “doing great things unsearchable, and wonderful things without number.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:10-18:9:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">9:10</a>) Job cannot win against Jehovah as his opponent-at-law. He can only implore God’s favor. And yet, is there any benefit in seeking to do what is right? “One blameless, also a wicked one, he is bringing to their end.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:22-18:9:22" data-bid="31-1" class="b">9:22</a>) There is no righteous judgment in the earth. Job fears he will lose his case even with God. He needs a mediator. He asks why he is being tried and implores God to remember that he is made “out of clay.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:9-18:10:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">10:9</a>) He appreciates God’s past kindnesses, but he says God will only be more greatly vexed if he argues, even though he is in the right. Could he but expire!</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">16, 17. (a) What smug advice does Zophar give? (b) How does Job evaluate his “comforters,” and what strong confidence does he express?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Zophar now enters the debate. He says, in effect: Are we children, to listen to empty talk? You say you are really clean, but if only God would speak, he would reveal your guilt. He asks Job: “Can you find out the deep things of God?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:11:7-18:11:7" data-bid="33-1" class="b">11:7</a>) He advises Job to put away hurtful practices, for blessings will come to those who do this, whereas “the very eyes of the wicked will fail.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:11:20-18:11:20" data-bid="34-1" class="b">11:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Job cries out with strong sarcasm: “For a fact you men are the people, and with you wisdom will die out!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:2-18:12:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b">12:2</a>) He may be a laughingstock, but he is not inferior. If his companions would look to the creations of God, even these would teach them something. Strength and practical wisdom belong to God, who controls all things, even to “making the nations grow great, that he may destroy them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:23-18:12:23" data-bid="36-1" class="b">12:23</a>) Job finds delight in arguing his case with God, but as for his three “comforters”​—“you men are smearers of falsehood; all of you are physicians of no value.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:13:4-18:13:4" data-bid="37-1" class="b">13:4</a>) It would be wisdom on their part to keep silent! He expresses confidence in the justness of his case and calls on God to hear him. He turns to the thought that “man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:1-18:14:1" data-bid="38-1" class="b">14:1</a>) Man soon passes, as a blossom or a shadow. You cannot produce someone clean out of someone unclean. In praying that God would keep him secret in Sheol until His anger turns back, Job asks: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again?” In answer he expresses strong hope: “I shall wait, until my relief comes.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:14:13-18:14:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">14:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">18, 19. (a) With what ridicule does Eliphaz open the second round of debate? (b) How does Job regard his companions’ “comfort,” and for what does he look to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> <strong>The debate: round two</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:15:1-18:21:34" data-bid="40-1" class="b">15:1–21:34</a>). In opening the second debate, Eliphaz ridicules Job’s knowledge, saying he has ‘filled his belly with the east wind.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:15:2-18:15:2" data-bid="41-1" class="b">15:2</a>) Again he disparages Job’s claim of integrity, holding that neither mortal man nor the holy ones in the heavens can hold faith in Jehovah’s eyes. He indirectly accuses Job of trying to show himself superior to God and of practicing apostasy, bribery, and deceit.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Job retorts that his companions are ‘troublesome comforters with windy words.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:16:2-18:16:3" data-bid="42-1" class="b">16:2, 3</a>) If they were in his place, he would not revile them. He greatly desires to be justified, and he looks to Jehovah, who has his record and who will decide his case. Job finds no wisdom in his companions. They take away all hope.

Eliphaz returns savagely to the attack, ridiculing Job’s claim of blamelessness before the Almighty. He brings lying slander against Job, claiming that he is bad, has exploited the poor, has held back bread from the hungry, and has mistreated widows and fatherless boys. Eliphaz says that Job’s private life is not as pure as he claims and that this explains Job’s bad condition.

In a final dissertation, Job completely silences his companions.

Job describes God’s wisdom in outer space, the earth, the clouds, the sea, and the wind​—all of which man has observed. These are but the fringes of the Almighty’s ways. They are hardly a whisper of the Almighty’s greatness.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">28. What forthright statement does Job make on integrity?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> Convinced of his innocence, he declares: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="56-1" class="b">27:5</a>) No, Job has not done anything to deserve what has befallen him.

God is the one who understands wisdom. He sees to the ends of the earth and the heavens, apportions out the wind and the waters, and controls the rain and the storm clouds. Job concludes: “Look!

He desires to be restored to his former intimate status with God, when he was respected even by the leaders of the town. He was a rescuer of the afflicted and eyes to the blind ones. His counsel was good, and people waited upon his words. But now, instead of having an honorable standing, he is laughed at even by those younger in days, whose fathers were not even fit to be with the dogs of his flock. They spit on him and oppose him. Now, in his greatest affliction, they give him no rest.</p>

He has not been an adulterer, nor a schemer against others. He has not neglected to help the needy. He has not trusted in material wealth, even though he was rich. He has not worshiped the sun, moon, and stars, for “that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:28-18:31:28" data-bid="60-1" class="b">31:28</a>) Job invites his opponent-at-law to file charges against the true record of his life.</p>

Meanwhile, Elihu, a descendant of Buz, a son of Nahor, and hence a distant relative of Abraham, has been listening to the debate. He has waited because of feeling that those of greater age should have greater knowledge. It is not age, however, but God’s spirit that gives understanding. Elihu’s anger blazes at Job’s “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God,” but it gets even hotter at Job’s three companions for their deplorable lack of wisdom in pronouncing God wicked. Elihu has “become full of words,” and God’s spirit compels him to give vent to these but without partiality or ‘bestowing titles on earthling man.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:2-18:32:3" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job 32:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:18-18:32:22" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 18-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:20-1:22:21" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> Gen. 22:20, 21</a>.</p>

He points out that Job has been more concerned with his own vindication than with God’s. It was not necessary for God to answer all of Job’s words, as if He had to justify His actions, and yet Job had contended against God. However, as Job’s soul draws close to death, God favors him with a messenger, saying: “Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:24-18:33:25" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25</a>) The righteous will be restored!</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"><sup>34</sup></span> Elihu calls on the wise ones to listen.

God judges without partiality. Job has been putting his own righteousness too much to the fore. He has been rash, not deliberately so, but “without knowledge”; and God has been long-suffering with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:35-18:34:35" data-bid="65-1" class="b">34:35</a>) More needs to be said for <em>God’s</em> vindication.

He poses a further series of challenging questions that exalt his dignity, superiority, and strength, as displayed in his natural creations. Even Behemoth and Leviathan are much more powerful than Job! Completely humbled, Job acknowledges his wrong viewpoint, and he admits that he spoke without knowledge.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[88]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> Jehovah’s righteous standards for living are set forth in many passages. The book strongly condemns materialism (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:24-18:31:25" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Job 31:24, 25</a>), idolatry (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:26-18:31:28" data-bid="93-1" class="b">31:26-28</a>), adultery (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:9-18:31:12" data-bid="94-1" class="b">31:9-12</a>), gloating (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:29-18:31:29" data-bid="95-1" class="b">31:29</a>), injustice and partiality (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:13-18:31:13" data-bid="96-1" class="b">31:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:21-18:32:21" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 32:21</a>), selfishness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:16-18:31:21" data-bid="97-1" class="b">31:16-21</a>), and dishonesty and lying (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:5-18:31:5" data-bid="98-1" class="b">31:5</a>), showing that a person who practices these things cannot gain God’s favor and eternal life. Elihu is a fine example of deep respect and modesty, together with boldness, courage, and exaltation of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:2-18:32:2" data-bid="99-1" class="b">32:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:6-18:32:7" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> 6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:9-18:32:10" data-bid="99-3" class="b"> 9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:18-18:32:20" data-bid="99-4" class="b"> 18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:6-18:33:6" data-bid="99-5" class="b"> 33:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:33-18:33:33" data-bid="99-6" class="b"> 33</a>) Job’s own exercise of headship, consideration of his family, and hospitality also provide a fine lesson.

<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">42. What fundamental Kingdom issue is clarified in Job, and what interesting aspects of this issue are explained?</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="42"><sup>42</sup></span> Job was not one of the seed of Abraham to whom the Kingdom promises were given, yet the record concerning his integrity does much to clarify understanding of Jehovah’s Kingdom purposes. The book is an essential part of the divine record, for it reveals the fundamental issue between God and Satan, which involves man’s integrity to Jehovah as his Sovereign. It shows that the angels, who were created before the earth and man, are also spectators and very much interested in this earth and the outcome of the controversy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:12" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:5" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 2:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:6-18:38:7" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 38:6, 7</a>) It indicates that the controversy existed before Job’s day and that Satan is an actual spirit person. If the book of Job was written by Moses, this is the first appearance of the expression <em>has·Sa·tanʹ</em> in the Hebrew text of the Bible, giving further identity to “the original serpent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a>, footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) The book also proves that God is not the cause of mankind’s suffering, sickness, and death, and it explains why the righteous are persecuted, while the wicked and wickedness are permitted to continue. It shows that Jehovah is interested in pushing the issue to its final settlement.</p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">43. In harmony with the divine revelations in the book of Job, what course must now be followed by all who seek God’s Kingdom blessings?</p>

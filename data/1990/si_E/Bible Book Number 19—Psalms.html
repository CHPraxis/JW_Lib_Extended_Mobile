<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 1. What is the book of Psalms, and what does it contain?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE book of Psalms was the inspired songbook of true worshipers of Jehovah in ancient times, a collection of 150 sacred songs, or psalms, set to music and arranged for the public worship of Jehovah God in his temple at Jerusalem. These psalms are songs of praise to Jehovah, and not only that, they also contain prayers of supplication for mercy and help, as well as expressions of trust and confidence. They abound with thanksgivings and exultations and with exclamations of great, yes, superlative, joy. Some are recapitulations of history, contemplating Jehovah’s loving-kindness and his great deeds. They are packed with prophecies, many of which have had remarkable fulfillments. They contain much instruction that is beneficial and upbuilding, all of it clothed in lofty language and imagery that stirs the reader to the very depths. The psalms are a sumptuous spiritual meal, beautifully prepared and spread invitingly before us.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 2. (a) What titles have been applied to Psalms, and with what meanings? (b) What is a psalm?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> What is the significance of the book’s title, and who wrote the Psalms? In the Hebrew Bible, the book is called <em>Seʹpher Tehil·limʹ,</em> meaning “Book of Praises,” or simply <em>Tehil·limʹ,</em> that is, “Praises.” This is the plural form of <em>Tehil·lahʹ,</em> meaning “A Praise” or “Song of Praise,” found in the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:0-19:145:0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 145</a>. The name “Praises” is most appropriate, as the book highlights praise to Jehovah. The title “Psalms” comes from the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> which used the word <em>Psal·moiʹ,</em> denoting songs sung with a musical accompaniment. The word is also found at a number of places in the Christian Greek Scriptures, such as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:42-42:20:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 20:42 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:20-44:1:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 1:20</a>. A psalm is a sacred song or poem used in the praise and worship of God.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 3. What do the superscriptions tell as to the writers?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Many of the psalms have headings, or superscriptions, and these often name the writer. Seventy-three headings bear the name of David, “the pleasant one of the melodies of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:1-10:23:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:1</a>) No doubt <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:1-19:2:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:0-19:72:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 72</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:1-19:95:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 95</a> were also written by David. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:25-44:4:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 4:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:20-19:72:20" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Psalm 72:20</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:7-58:4:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:7</a>.) Additionally, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:1-19:10:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalms 10 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:71:1-19:71:24" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 71</a> appear to be a continuation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:0-19:9:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalms 9 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:70:0-19:70:5" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 70</a> respectively and therefore may be attributed to David. Twelve psalms are ascribed to Asaph, evidently denoting the house of Asaph, as some of these speak of events later than Asaph’s day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:0-19:79:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 79;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:80:0-19:80:19" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ps 80;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:4-13:16:5" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 16:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:7-13:16:7" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:41-15:2:41" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> Ezra 2:41</a>) Eleven psalms are directly attributed to the sons of Korah.

In addition to mentioning “the sons of Korah,” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 88</a> also accredits Heman in its superscription, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:0-19:89:52" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 89</a> names Ethan as the writer. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:0-19:90:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 90</a> is attributed to Moses, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:1-19:91:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> is probably Moses’ as well. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:0-19:127:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 127</a> is Solomon’s. Over two thirds of the psalms are thus ascribed to various writers.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 4. What time period is covered by the writing?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The book of Psalms is the Bible’s largest single book. As evidenced by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:0-19:90:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalms 90,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:126:0-19:126:6" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 126</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 137</a>, it was long in the writing, at least from the time Moses wrote (1513-1473 B.C.E.) until after the restoration from Babylon and probably Ezra’s day (537–c. 460 B.C.E.). Thus, the writing is seen to span approximately a thousand years. The time covered by the contents is much greater, though, starting from the time of the creation and epitomizing the history of Jehovah’s dealings with his servants down to the time of the composition of the last of the psalms.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 5. (a) How does the book of Psalms reflect organization? (b) What further information is supplied by the superscriptions? (c) Why is it not necessary to pronounce the word <em>“Seʹlah”</em> in reading the psalms?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The book of Psalms is one that reflects organization. David himself refers to “the processions of my God, my King, into the holy place. The singers went in front, the players on stringed instruments after them; in between were the maidens beating tambourines. In congregated throngs bless God, Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:24-19:68:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 68:24-26</a>) This gives the reason for the oft repeated expression “To the director” in the superscriptions, as well as the many poetic and musical terms. Some superscriptions explain the use or purpose of a psalm or provide musical <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>instructions. (See the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:0-19:6:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalms 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:30:0-19:30:12" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:0-19:38:22" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:60:0-19:60:12" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 60,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 88,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:0-19:102:28" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> 102</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:120:0-19:120:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 120</a>.) For at least 13 of David’s psalms, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:0-19:18:50" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalms 18 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:0-19:51:19" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 51</a>, the events spurring their composition are briefly related. Thirty-four of the psalms are entirely without superscriptions. The little word <em>“Seʹlah,”</em> occurring 71 times in the main text, is generally thought to be a technical term for music or recitation, although its exact significance is unknown. It is suggested by some that it indicates a pause for silent meditation in the singing or in both the singing and the instrumental music. Hence, it need not be pronounced in reading.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 6. (a) Into what separate volumes has the book of Psalms been divided? (b) Who apparently arranged the book of Psalms into final form?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> From ancient times, the book of Psalms has been divided into five separate books, or volumes, as follows: (1) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:41:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalms 1-41</a>; (2) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:0-19:72:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalms 42-72</a>; (3) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:0-19:89:52" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalms 73-89</a>; (4) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:0-19:106:48" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalms 90-106</a>; (5) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:1-19:150:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalms 107-150</a>. It appears that the first collection of these songs was made by David. Evidently Ezra, the priest and “skilled copyist in the law of Moses,” was the one used by Jehovah to arrange the book of Psalms into final form.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:6-15:7:6" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 7. What other features of Psalms are to be noted?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The progressive growth of the collection may explain why some of the psalms are repeated in the different sections, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:0-19:14:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalms 14 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:53:0-19:53:6" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:13-19:40:17" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 40:13-17 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:70:0-19:70:5" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> Ps 70;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:57:7-19:57:11" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> 57:7-11 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:108:1-19:108:5" data-bid="31-6" class="b"> Ps 108:1-5</a>. Each of the five sections closes with a blessing pronounced on Jehovah, or a doxology​—the first four of these including responses by the people and the last one being the entire <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:1-19:150:6" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 150</a>.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:13-19:41:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 41:13</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 8. Explain and illustrate the acrostic style of composition.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> A very special style of composition is employed in nine psalms; it is called acrostic because of its alphabetic structure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:0-19:9:20" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalms 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:1-19:10:18" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:0-19:25:22" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:0-19:34:22" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:0-19:37:40" data-bid="34-5" class="b"> 37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:1-19:111:10" data-bid="34-6" class="b"> 111,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:112:1-19:112:10" data-bid="34-7" class="b"> 112,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="34-8" class="b"> 119</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:0-19:145:21" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps 145</a>) In this structure the first verse or verses of the first stanza begin with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, <em>ʼaʹleph</em> (א), the next verse(s) with the second letter, <em>behth</em> (ב), and so on, through all or nearly all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This may have served as a memory aid​—just think of the temple singers having to remember songs as long as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a>! Interestingly, an acrostic of Jehovah’s name is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:11-19:96:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 96:11</a>. The first half of this verse in Hebrew consists of four words, and the initial letters of these words, when read from right to left, are the four Hebrew consonants of the Tetragrammaton, <em>YHWH</em> (יהוה).</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 9. (a) Because of what background do many of the psalms make a direct appeal to mind and heart? (b) What else contributes to their power and beauty?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> These sacred, lyric poems are written in unrhymed Hebrew verse and display unsurpassed beauty of style and rhythmic flow of thought. They speak directly to the mind and heart. They paint vivid pictures. The wonderful breadth and depth, in both the subject matter and the strong emotions expressed, are due in part to David’s extraordinary life experiences, which provide background to many of the psalms. Few men have lived so varied a life​—as a shepherd boy, a lone warrior against Goliath, a court musician, an outlaw among loyal friends and among traitors, a king and conqueror, a loving father beset with divisions in his own household, one who twice experienced the bitterness of serious sin and yet was ever an enthusiastic worshiper of Jehovah and lover of His Law. Against such a background, it is little wonder that the book of Psalms runs the entire scale of human emotions! Contributing to its power and beauty are the poetic parallelisms and contrasts so characteristic of Hebrew verse.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:6-19:1:6" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:20-19:22:20" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 22:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:1-19:42:1" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 42:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:3-19:121:4" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 121:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The authenticity of these most ancient songs to Jehovah’s praise is amply testified to by their being in complete harmony with the rest of the Scriptures.

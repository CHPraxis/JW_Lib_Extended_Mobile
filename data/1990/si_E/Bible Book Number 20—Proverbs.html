<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu"> 1. What wisdom is to be found in the book of Proverbs?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN Solomon, the son of David, became king of Israel in 1037 B.C.E., he prayed to Jehovah for “wisdom and knowledge” to “judge this great people.” In response, Jehovah gave him ‘knowledge and wisdom and an understanding heart.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:1:10-14:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 1:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:12-11:3:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:30-11:4:31" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 4:30, 31</a>) As a result, Solomon came to “speak three thousand proverbs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:32-11:4:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:32</a>) Some of this spoken wisdom was recorded in the Bible book of Proverbs. Since his wisdom was really that which “God had put in his heart,” then in studying Proverbs we are in fact studying the wisdom of Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:23-11:10:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:23, 24</a>) These proverbs sum up eternal truths. They are just as up-to-date now as when they were first uttered.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 2. Why was Solomon’s time an appropriate one in which to provide the divine guidance in Proverbs?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The reign of Solomon was an appropriate time for providing this divine guidance. Solomon was said to “sit upon Jehovah’s throne.” The theocratic kingdom of Israel was at its height, and Solomon was favored with surpassing “royal dignity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:25-13:29:25" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25</a>) It was a time of peace and plenty, a time of security. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:20-11:4:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:20-25</a>) However, even under that theocratic rule, the people still had their personal problems and difficulties due to human imperfections. That the people would look to wise King Solomon to help them solve their problems is understandable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:16-11:3:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 3:16-28</a>) In the course of pronouncing judgment in these many cases, he uttered proverbial sayings that fitted the many circumstances <span id="page107" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>of life arising from day to day. These brief but impressive sayings were greatly treasured by those who desired to regulate their lives in accordance with the will of God.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 3. How did Proverbs come to be compiled?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The record does not say that Solomon <em>wrote</em> the Proverbs. However, it says that he <em>‘spoke’</em> proverbs, also that “he . . . made a thorough search, that he might arrange many proverbs in order,” thus showing that he had an interest in preserving proverbs for later use. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:32-11:4:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:9-21:12:9" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eccl. 12:9</a>) In the time of David and Solomon, there were official secretaries in the lists of court officials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:20:25-10:20:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 20:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:12:10-12:12:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 12:10</a>) Whether these scribes in his court wrote and collected his proverbs, we do not know, but the expressions of any ruler of his caliber would be highly regarded and would normally be recorded. It is generally agreed that the book is a collection compiled from other collections.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 4. (a) How is the book of Proverbs generally divided? (b) Who originated the bulk of the proverbs?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The book of Proverbs may be divided into five sections. These are: (1) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:1-20:9:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Chapters 1-9</a>, opening with the words, “The proverbs of Solomon the son of David”; (2) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:1-20:24:34" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Chapters 10-24</a>, described as the “Proverbs of Solomon”; (3) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:1-20:29:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Chapters 25-29</a>, which division begins: “These also are the proverbs of Solomon that the men of Hezekiah the king of Judah transcribed”; (4) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:1-20:30:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Chapter 30</a>, introduced as “The words of Agur the son of Jakeh”; and (5) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:1-20:31:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Chapter 31</a>, which comprises “The words of Lemuel the king, the weighty message that his mother gave to him in correction.” Solomon was thus the originator of the bulk of the proverbs. As to Agur and Lemuel, nothing definite is known about their identity. Some commentators suggest that Lemuel may have been another name for Solomon.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 5. When was Proverbs written and compiled?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> When was Proverbs written and compiled? The greater part was no doubt written down during Solomon’s reign (1037-998 B.C.E.) before his deflection. Because of uncertainty as to the identity of Agur and Lemuel, it is not possible to date their material. Since one of the collections was made in the reign of Hezekiah (745-717 B.C.E.), it could not have been before his reign that the final collecting was done. Were the last two divisions also collected under King Hezekiah’s purview? In answer there is an illuminating footnote to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:31-20:31:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:31</a> in the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References:</em> “Some ed[itions] of the Heb[rew] text display the trigrammaton, or three letters, <em>Chehth, Zaʹyin, Qohph</em> (חזק) that stand as King Hezekiah’s signature to the copy-work done by his scribes to signify that the work had been completed.”</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu"> 6. What is a proverb, and why is the Hebrew title of the book fitting?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In Hebrew Bibles the book was first called by the opening word in the book, <em>mish·lehʹ,</em> meaning “proverbs.” <em>Mish·lehʹ</em> is the plural number, construct state, of the Hebrew noun <em>ma·shalʹ,</em> which noun is generally thought to be derived from a root word meaning “be like” or “be comparable.” These terms nicely describe the contents of the book, for proverbs are pithy sayings that often employ likenesses or comparisons and that are designed to make the hearer think. The brief form of the proverbs makes them easy to follow and interesting, and in this form they are easily taught, learned, and remembered. The idea sticks.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu"> 7. What should be noted about the style of Proverbs?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The style of expression in the book is also most interesting. It is in Hebrew poetic style. The structure of most of the book is parallel poetry. This does not make the ends of lines or verses rhyme, or sound alike. It consists of making rhythmic lines give parallel thoughts or ideas. Its beauty and power of instruction lie in this thought rhythm. The thoughts may be synonymous or contrasting, but the power of the parallel is there to give extension to the thought, to enlarge upon the idea, and to make sure of conveying the meaning in the thought. Examples of the synonymous parallelism are to be found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:18-20:16:18" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16:18</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:15-20:18:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">18:15</a>, and examples of the more abundant contrasting parallelism at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:7-20:10:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:30-20:10:30" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 12:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:25-20:13:25" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 13:25</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:8-20:15:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">15:8</a>. Another type of structure is found right at the end of the book. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-31</a>) The 22 verses there are arranged so that in Hebrew each one begins with the succeeding letter of the Hebrew alphabet, this being the acrostic style that is used also in a number of the psalms. For beauty this style has no parallel in ancient writings.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu"> 8. How does the use made of Proverbs by the early Christians testify to its authenticity?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> The authenticity of Proverbs is also shown in the wide use made of the book by the early Christians in stating rules of conduct. James was apparently very familiar with Proverbs and used its basic principles in the fine counsel he gave for Christian conduct. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 17:27</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">James 1:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:34-20:3:34" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Proverbs 3:34</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">James 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:1-20:27:1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Proverbs 27:1</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:13-59:4:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">James 4:13, 14</a>.) Direct quotations from Proverbs are also to be found in the following passages: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:20-45:12:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 12:20</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:21-20:25:22" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:6" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>—​<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:22-61:2:22" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:22</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:11-20:26:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu"> 9. How does Proverbs harmonize with the rest of the Bible?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span id="page108" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="108" data-before-text="108"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> In addition, Proverbs shows itself to be in harmony with the rest of the Bible, thus proving it to be a part of “all Scripture.” It presents striking unity of thought when compared with the Law of Moses, Jesus’ teaching, and the writings of Jesus’ disciples and apostles. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:16-20:10:16" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:16</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:58 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:8-48:6:9" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Proverbs 12:25</a>—​<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:25" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 6:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:20-20:20:20" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Proverbs 20:20</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Exodus 20:12 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:4-40:15:4" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Matthew 15:4</a>.) Even when touching on such points as the readying of the earth for human habitation, there is oneness of thinking with other Bible writers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:19-20:3:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Prov. 3:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:6-1:1:7" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Gen. 1:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:11" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Job 38:4-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:5-19:104:9" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> Ps. 104:5-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">10, 11. What further testifies to the book’s divine inspiration?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Also testifying to the book’s divine inspiration is its scientific accuracy, whether the proverb involves chemical, medical, or health principles. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:20-20:25:20" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:20</a> apparently tells of acid-alkali reactions. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:4-20:31:5" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:4, 5</a> agrees with modern scientific findings that alcohol dulls the thinking processes. Many doctors and nutritionists agree that honey is a healthful food, calling to mind the proverb: “My son, eat honey, for it is good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:13-20:24:13" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Prov. 24:13</a>) Modern observations on psychosomatics are not new to Proverbs. “A heart that is joyful does good as a curer.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="36-1" class="b">17:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:17-20:15:17" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 15:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Indeed, so completely does the book of Proverbs cover every human need and situation that one authority stated: “There is no relation in life which has not its appropriate instruction, no good or evil tendency without its proper incentive or correction. The human consciousness is everywhere brought into immediate relation with the Divine, . . . and man walks as in the presence of his Maker and Judge . . . Every type of humanity is found in this ancient book; and though sketched three thousand years ago, is still as true to nature as if now drawn from its living representative.”​—Smith’s <em>Dictionary of the Bible,</em> 1890, Vol. III, page 2616.</p>

This is a connected poem made up of short discourses as though from a father to a son, dealing with the need for wisdom to guide the heart, or the whole inner person, and to direct desire. It teaches the value of wisdom and its blessings: happiness, pleasantness, peace, and life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:33-20:1:33" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:13-20:3:18" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 3:13-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:32-20:8:35" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 8:32-35</a>) It contrasts this with the lack of wisdom and its results: suffering and finally death.

The words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:7" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:7</a> set the pattern for the entire book: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge.” All actions must show that Jehovah is taken into consideration.

A list of the great variety of human situations dealt with will show what a broad coverage this book gives. It is most beneficial to have this Bible counsel on pretense, presumptuousness, keeping one’s word, shrewdness, associations, child correction and training, man’s view of what is right, being slow to anger, favor to the afflicted, fraud, prayer, ridicule, contentment with life’s necessities, pride, unjust profit, bribery, contention, self-control, isolation, silence, partiality, quarreling, humility, luxury, care of a father and a mother, intoxicating beverages, cheating, qualities of a wife, gifts, borrowing, lending, kindness, confidence, property lines, building up the household, envy, retaliation, vanity, mild answer, meditation, and true companionship. Quite a wealth of counsel to go to for sound guidance on everyday affairs! To some, a number of these items may seem unimportant, but herein we note that the Bible does not neglect our needs even in seemingly small things. In this, Proverbs is of inestimable value.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">16. What upbuilding counsel is given in the third section of Proverbs?</p>

Upbuilding counsel is given on such matters as honor, patience, enemies, dealing with stupid persons, having fun, flattery, jealousy, hurt caused by a friend, hunger, slander, attention to responsibility, interest, confession, results of wicked rule, arrogance, the blessings of righteous rule, child delinquency, treatment of servants, insight, and vision.</p>

This is “the weighty message” attributed to Agur. After a humble admission of his own unimportance, the writer makes reference to the inability of man to create the earth and the things in it. He calls God’s Word refined and a shield. He asks that the lying word be put far away from him and that he be given neither riches nor poverty. He describes an impure, proud, and greedy generation that calls down evil upon its parents. Four things that have not said “Enough!” are identified, along with four things that are too difficult to comprehend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:15-20:30:16" data-bid="51-1" class="b">30:15, 16</a>) An adulterous woman’s brazen self-acquittal is given. Then there are described four things under which the earth cannot endure, four small things instinctively wise, and four things that excel in their moving along. By apt comparisons, the writer warns that “the squeezing out of anger is what brings forth quarreling.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:33-20:30:33" data-bid="52-1" class="b">30:33</a>.</p>

Here is another “weighty message,” that of Lemuel the king. This is in two styles of writing. The first part discusses the ruin to which one can come through a bad woman, warns how intoxicating liquor can pervert judgment, and calls for righteous judgment. The acrostic in the latter part is devoted to a classic description of a capable wife. In some detail it considers her value, pointing out that she is trusted and rewarding to her owner. Her qualities include being industrious, an early riser, a careful buyer, kind to the poor, as well as exercising foresight and speaking with wisdom. She is also alert, respected by her children, and praised by her husband. Above all, she fears Jehovah.</p>

One can never acquire accurate knowledge without the fear of Jehovah, for knowledge starts with that fear. Knowledge is to be preferred rather than choice gold. Why? Through knowledge the righteous are rescued; it holds us back from hastening into sin. How we need to search for it, to take it in! Precious it is. So “incline your ear and hear the words of the wise ones, that you may apply your very heart to my knowledge.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:17-20:22:17" data-bid="55-1" class="b">22:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:7" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:10-20:8:10" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> 8:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:9-20:11:9" data-bid="55-4" class="b"> 11:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:15-20:18:15" data-bid="55-5" class="b"> 18:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:2-20:19:2" data-bid="55-6" class="b"> 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:15-20:20:15" data-bid="55-7" class="b"> 20:15</a>.</p>

Its Source is Jehovah. Life-giving wisdom has its start in knowing and fearing Jehovah God​—that is the great secret of wisdom. So fear God, not man. Wisdom personified issues a proclamation, urging all to mend their ways. Wisdom cries aloud in the very streets. Jehovah calls out to all those inexperienced ones and those in want of heart to turn aside and feed themselves with wisdom’s bread. Then, with the <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>fear of Jehovah, they will be happy even if they have little. Many are the blessings of wisdom; greatly beneficial are its effects. Wisdom and knowledge​—these are preliminary fundamentals for thinking ability, the kind that will safeguard us.

To understand, we must have knowledge. The search that the understanding one makes for knowledge is rewarded, and wisdom is in front of him.

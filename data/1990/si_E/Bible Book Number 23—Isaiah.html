<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 1. What was the situation in the Middle East, and particularly in Israel and Judah, in the eighth century B.C.E.?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE menacing shadow of the cruel Assyrian monarch hung heavy over the other empires and lesser kingdoms of the Middle East. The whole area was alive with talk of conspiracy and confederation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:9-23:8:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9-13</a>) Apostate Israel to the north would soon fall victim to this international intrigue, while Judah’s kings to the south were reigning precariously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:1-12:21:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki., chaps. 15-21</a>) New weapons of war were being developed and put into action, adding to the terror of the times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:14-14:26:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:14, 15</a>) Where could anyone look for protection and salvation? Although the name of Jehovah was on the lips of the people and the priests in the little kingdom of Judah, their hearts turned far off in other directions, first to Assyria and then down to Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:7-12:16:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Ki. 16:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:21-12:18:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 18:21</a>) Faith in Jehovah’s power waned. Where it was not outright idolatry, there prevailed a hypocritical way of worship, based on formalism and not the true fear of God.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 2. (a) Who answered the call to speak for Jehovah, and when? (b) What is significant about this prophet’s name?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Who, then, would speak for Jehovah? Who would declare his saving power? “Here I am! Send me,” came the ready response. The speaker was Isaiah, who had already been prophesying before this. It was the year that leprous King Uzziah died, about 778 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 8</a>) The name Isaiah means “Salvation of Jehovah,” which is the same meaning, though written in the reverse order, of the name Jesus (“Jehovah Is Salvation”). From start to finish, Isaiah’s prophecy highlights this fact, that Jehovah is salvation.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 3. (a) What is known concerning Isaiah? (b) Throughout what period did he prophesy, and who were other prophets of his day?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Isaiah was the son of Amoz (not to be confused with Amos, another prophet from Judah). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1:1</a>) The Scriptures are silent as to his birth and death, though Jewish tradition has him sawn asunder by wicked King Manasseh. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:37-58:11:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:37</a>.) His writings show him stationed in Jerusalem with his prophetess wife and at least two sons with prophetic names. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:3-23:7:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 7:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:1-23:8:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:3-23:8:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 3</a>) He served during the time of at least four kings of Judah: Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; evidently beginning about 778 B.C.E. (when Uzziah died, or possibly earlier) and continuing at least till after 732 B.C.E. (Hezekiah’s 14th year), or no less than 46 years. No doubt he had also committed his prophecy to writing by this latter date. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:1-23:6:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:1-23:36:1" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 36:1</a>) Other prophets of his day were Micah in Judah and, to the north, Hosea and Oded.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:1-33:1:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mic. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:1-28:1:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Hos. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:6-14:28:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu"> 4. What indicates that Isaiah was the writer of the book?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> That Jehovah commanded Isaiah to write down prophetic judgments is established by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:8-23:30:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:8</a>: “Now come, write it upon a tablet with them, and inscribe it even in a book, that it may serve for a future day, for a witness to time indefinite.” The ancient Jewish rabbis recognized Isaiah as the writer and included the book as the first book of the major prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel).</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"> 5. What testifies to the unity of the book of Isaiah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Though some have pointed to the book’s change of style from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:40:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">chapter 40</a> onward as indicating a different writer, or “Second Isaiah,” the change in subject matter should be sufficient to explain this. There is much evidence that Isaiah wrote the entire book that bears his name. For example, the oneness of the book is indicated by the expression, “the Holy One of Israel,” which appears 12 times in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:39:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">chapters 1 to 39</a>, and 13 times in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:66:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">chapters 40 to 66</a>, a total of 25 times; whereas it appears only 6 times throughout the rest of the Hebrew Scriptures. The apostle Paul also testifies to the unity of the book by quoting from all parts of the prophecy and crediting the whole work to one writer, Isaiah.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:16-45:10:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 10:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:20-45:10:20" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:12-45:15:12" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 15:12</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:1-23:65:1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 65:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:1-23:11:1" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 11:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"> 6. How does the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah give convincing proof (a) that our Bibles today represent the original inspired writing and (b) that the entire book was written by the one Isaiah?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Interestingly, starting in the year 1947, some ancient documents were brought out of the darkness of caves not far from Khirbet Qumran, near the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. These were <span id="page119" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="119" data-before-text="119"></span>the Dead Sea Scrolls, which included the prophecy of Isaiah. This is beautifully written in well-preserved pre-Masoretic Hebrew and is some 2,000 years old, from the end of the second century B.C.E. Its text is thus about a thousand years older than the oldest existing manuscript of the Masoretic text, on which modern translations of the Hebrew Scriptures are based. There are some minor variations of spelling and some differences in grammatical construction, but it does not vary doctrinally from the Masoretic text. Here is convincing proof that our Bibles today contain the original inspired message of Isaiah. Moreover, these ancient scrolls refute the critics’ claims of two “Isaiahs,” since <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:40:31" data-bid="17-1" class="b">chapter 40</a> begins on the last line of the column of writing containing <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:39:1-23:39:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">chapter 39</a>, the opening sentence being completed in the next column. Thus, the copyist was obviously unaware of any supposed change in writer or of any division in the book at this point.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 7. What abundant proof is there concerning Isaiah’s authenticity?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> There is abundant proof of the authenticity of Isaiah’s book. Aside from Moses, no other prophet is more often quoted by the Christian Bible writers. There is likewise a wealth of historical and archaeological evidence that proves it genuine, such as the historical records of the Assyrian monarchs, including Sennacherib’s hexagonal prism on which he gives his own account of the siege of Jerusalem.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:1-23:36:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa., chaps. 36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:1-23:37:38" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 37</a>) The heap of ruins that was once Babylon still bears witness to the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:17-23:13:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 13:17-22</a>.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> There was a living testimony in each one of the thousands of Jews that marched back from Babylon, freed by a king whose name, Cyrus, had been penned by Isaiah nearly 200 years earlier. It may well be that Cyrus was later shown this prophetic writing, for, on freeing the Jewish remnant, he spoke of being commissioned by Jehovah to do so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:28-23:44:28" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 44:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:1-23:45:1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 45:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:1-15:1:3" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 8. How is inspiration proved by fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Outstanding in the book of Isaiah are the Messianic prophecies. Isaiah has been called “the Evangelist prophet,” so numerous are the predictions fulfilled in the events of Jesus’ life. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Chapter 53</a>, for long a “mystery chapter,” not only to the Ethiopian eunuch referred to in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:40" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts chapter 8</a> but to the Jewish people as a whole, foretells so vividly the treatment accorded Jesus that it is like an eyewitness account.

Isaiah now points back to Philistia along the Mediterranean Sea and then to Moab, southeast of the Dead Sea. He directs his prophecy up beyond Israel’s northern boundary to Syrian Damascus, dips deep south into Ethiopia, and moves up the Nile into Egypt, with God’s judgments producing desolation all along the way. He tells of the Assyrian king Sargon, the predecessor of Sennacherib, sending commander Tartan against the Philistine city of Ashdod, west of Jerusalem. At this time Isaiah is told to strip and go naked and barefoot for three years. Thus he vividly portrays the futility of trusting in Egypt and Ethiopia, who, with “buttocks stripped,” will be led captive by the Assyrian.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:20:4-23:20:4" data-bid="52-1" class="b">20:4</a>.</p>

Is Isaiah’s exhortation to rely on Jehovah practical? Can it stand the test? In the 14th year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib of Assyria makes a scythelike sweep through Palestine and diverts some of his troops to try to intimidate Jerusalem.

When the king of Babylon sends messengers, hypocritically congratulating him on his recovery, Hezekiah indiscreetly shows them the royal treasures.

He gives full power and dynamic energy to the tired and weary ones who hope in him. He declares the molten images of the nations to be wind and unreality. His chosen one will be as a covenant for the peoples and a light of the nations to open blind eyes.

He mocks Babylon’s gods Bel and Nebo, for only He can tell the finale from the beginning. The virgin daughter of Babylon is to sit in the dust, dethroned and naked, and the multitude of her counselors will be burned up like stubble.

Peter too quotes Isaiah in showing the permanence of the good news: “For ‘all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of grass; the grass becomes withered, and the flower falls off, but the saying of Jehovah endures forever.’ Well, this is the ‘saying,’ this which has been declared to you as good news.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:24-60:1:25" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:6-23:40:8" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:6-8</a>.</p>

Studies on the Inspired Scriptures and Their Background
Study Number 10​—The Bible—​Authentic and True
The Bible’s coverage of history, geography, and human origins; its accuracy as to science, culture, and customs; the candor, harmony, and integrity of its writers; and its prophecy.
 1. (a) As what is the Bible generally accepted? (b) What is the underlying reason for the Bible’s preeminence?
THE Bible is generally accepted as a great literary masterpiece of transcendent poetic beauty and a remarkable accomplishment for the men who were its writers. But it is much more than that. The writers themselves testified that what they wrote originated with Jehovah, the almighty God himself. This is the underlying reason for the Bible’s beauty of expression and, more important, its surpassing value as the book of life-giving knowledge and wisdom. Jesus, the Son of God, testified that the words he spoke “are spirit and are life,” and he quoted copiously from the ancient Hebrew Scriptures. “All Scripture is inspired of God,” said the apostle Paul, who spoke of the Hebrew Scriptures as “the sacred pronouncements of God.”​—John 6:63; 2 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 3:1, 2.
 2, 3. How did the Bible’s writers testify to its inspiration?
2 The apostle Peter testified that the prophets of God were moved by holy spirit. King David wrote: “The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.” (2 Sam. 23:2) The prophets credited their utterances to Jehovah. Moses warned against making any addition to or taking away from the sacred words given him by Jehovah. Peter counted Paul’s writings as inspired, and Jude seemingly quoted Peter’s statement as inspired authority. Finally, John, the writer of Revelation, wrote as he was directed by the spirit of God and warned that anyone adding to or taking away from this prophetic revelation would be accountable, not to man, but directly to God.​—1 Pet. 1:10-12; 2 Pet. 1:19-21; Deut. 4:2; 2 Pet. 3:15, 16; Jude 17, 18; Rev. 1:1, 10; 21:5; 22:18, 19.
3 These devoted slaves of God all testified that the Bible is inspired and true. There are many other proofs of the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures, some of which we will discuss under the 12 headings that follow.
 4. How were the books of the Hebrew Scriptures always viewed by the Jews?
4 (1) Historical Accuracy. From the earliest times, the canonical books of the Hebrew Scriptures have been received by the Jews as inspired and as wholly trustworthy documents. Thus, in David’s time, the events recorded from Genesis to First Samuel were fully accepted as the true history of the nation and God’s dealings with them, and this is illustrated by the 78th Psalm, which refers to more than 35 of these details.
 5. What have ancient writers testified concerning Moses and the Law code of the Jews?
5 Opponents of the Bible have strongly attacked the Pentateuch, especially as to authenticity and authorship. However, to the Jews’ acceptance of Moses as writer of the Pentateuch may be added the testimony of ancient writers, some of whom were enemies of the Jews. Hecataeus of Abdera, the Egyptian historian Manetho, Lysimachus of Alexandria, Eupolemus, Tacitus, and Juvenal all ascribe to Moses the institution of the code of laws distinguishing the Jews from other nations, and the majority distinctly note that he committed his laws to writing. Numenius, the Pythagorean philosopher, even mentions Jannes and Jambres as the Egyptian priests who withstood Moses. (2 Tim. 3:8) These authors cover a period extending from the time of Alexander (fourth century B.C.E.), when the Greeks first became curious about Jewish history, to that of Emperor Aurelian (third century C.E.). Many other ancient writers mention Moses as a leader, ruler, or lawgiver.a As we have seen from the previous study, archaeological discoveries often support the historical accuracy of events recorded in the Bible where God’s people became involved with the surrounding nations.
 6. What testimony supports the historical accuracy of the Greek Scriptures?
6 But what of the Christian Greek Scriptures? Not only do they verify the Hebrew Scripture account but they themselves are proved to be historically accurate as well as authentic and of equal inspiration with the Hebrew Scriptures. The writers declare to us what they heard and saw, for they were eyewitnesses of and often participants in the very events that they recorded. They were believed by thousands of their contemporaries. Their testimony finds abundant confirmation in references by ancient writers, among whom are Juvenal, Tacitus, Seneca, Suetonius, Pliny the Younger, Lucian, Celsus, and the Jewish historian Josephus.
 7. (a) What argument does S. A. Allibone present as to the Bible’s superior claims to authenticity? (b) What does he say is at fault with those who refuse the evidence?
7 Writing in The Union Bible Companion, S. Austin Allibone says: “Sir Isaac Newton . . . was also eminent as a critic of ancient writings, and examined with great care the Holy Scriptures. What is his verdict on this point? ‘I find,’ says he, ‘more sure marks of authenticity in the New Testament than in any profane [secular] history whatever.’ Dr. Johnson says that we have more evidence that Jesus Christ died on Calvary, as stated in the Gospels, than we have that Julius Caesar died in the Capitol. We have, indeed, far more. Ask anyone who professes to doubt the truth of the Gospel history what reason he has for believing that Caesar died in the Capitol, or that the Emperor Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the West by Pope Leo III. in 800 . . . How do you know that such a man as Charles I. ever lived, and was beheaded, and that Oliver Cromwell became ruler in his stead? . . . Sir Isaac Newton is credited with the discovery of the law of gravitation . . . We believe all the assertions just made respecting these men; and that because we have historical evidence of their truth. . . . If, on the production of such proof as this, any still refuse to believe, we abandon them as stupidly perverse or hopelessly ignorant. What shall we say, then, of those who, notwithstanding the abundant evidence now produced of the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures, profess themselves unconvinced? . . . Surely we have reason to conclude that it is the heart rather than the head which is at fault;​—that they do not wish to believe that which humbles their pride, and will force them to lead different lives.”b
 8. In what way is the Christianity of the Bible shown to be distinguished from all other religions?
8 The superiority of Christianity as a religion whose followers worship with truth is highlighted by George Rawlinson, who wrote: “Christianity​—including therein the dispensation of the Old Testament, which was its first stage—​is in nothing more distinguished from the other religions of the world than in its objective or historical character. The religions of Greece and Rome, of Egypt, India, Persia, and the East generally, were speculative systems, which did not even seriously postulate an historical basis. . . . But it is otherwise with the religion of the Bible. There, whether we look to the Old or the New Testament, to the Jewish dispensation or to the Christian, we find a scheme of doctrine which is bound up with facts; which depends absolutely upon them; which is null and void without them; and which may be regarded as for all practical purposes established if they are shown to deserve acceptance.”c
 9. Illustrate the accuracy of the Bible’s geographic references.
9 (2) Geographic and Geologic Accuracy. Many writers have commented on the remarkable accuracy of the Bible description of the Promised Land and neighboring territories. As an example, an Oriental traveler, Dr. A. P. Stanley, said concerning the Israelites’ wilderness trek: “Even if their precise route were unknown, yet the peculiar features of the country have so much in common that the history would still receive many remarkable illustrations. . . . The occasional springs, and wells, and brooks, are in accordance with the notices of the ‘waters’ of Marah; the ‘springs’ of . . . Elim; the ‘brook’ of Horeb; the ‘well’ of Jethro’s daughters, with its ‘trough’ or tanks, in Midian. The vegetation is still that which we should infer from the Mosaic history.”d In the account of Egypt, the accuracy is seen not only in the general description of the territory​—its rich grain lands, its Nile River edged with reeds (Gen. 41:47-49; Ex. 2:3), its waters derived from ‘rivers, canals, reedy pools, and impounded waters’ (Ex. 7:19), its ‘flax, barley, wheat, and spelt’ (Ex. 9:31, 32)​—but also in the names and sites of towns.
10. How have modern scientists been rewarded in following the Bible record?
10 Such is the reliance placed on the geologic and geographic record in the Bible by some modern-day scientists that they have followed it as a guide and have been well rewarded. Some years ago, a noted geologist, Dr. Ben Tor, followed through on the scripture: “For Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, . . . a land the stones of which are iron.” (Deut. 8:7, 9) A few miles from Beer-sheba, he found immense cliffs saturated with red-black ore. Here was an estimated 15 million tons [13.6 million metric tons] of low-grade iron ore. Later, engineers discovered a mile-long [1.5 km] outcrop of excellent ore, 60 to 65 percent pure iron. Dr. Joseph Weitz, Israel’s noted authority on reforestation, said: “The first tree Abraham put in the soil of Beersheba was a tamarisk.” “Following his lead, four years ago we put out two million in the same area. Abraham was right. The tamarisk is one of the few trees we have found that thrives in the south where yearly rainfall is less than six inches.”e The book Tree and Shrub in Our Biblical Heritage, by Nogah Hareuveni, adds: “It appears that the Patriarch Abraham did not simply plant any tree upon arriving in Beersheva. . . . He chose the tree whose shade is cooler than that of other trees. Moreover, the [tamarisk] can withstand heat and long dry spells by sending its roots deep down to find underground water. Not surprisingly, the [tamarisk] remains to this day in the vicinity of Beersheva.”f​—Gen. 21:33.
11. How does Professor Wilson testify concerning Bible accuracy?
11 As to details such as chronological and geographic statements in the Bible, Professor R. D. Wilson writes in A Scientific Investigation of the Old Testament, pages 213-14: “The chronological and geographical statements are more accurate and reliable than those afforded by any other ancient documents; and the biographical and other historical narratives harmonize marvelously with the evidence afforded by extra-biblical documents.”
12. How do the facts fit the Bible record of the origin of mankind?
12 (3) Races and Languages of Mankind. In the book After Its Kind, Byron C. Nelson says: “It was man that was made, not the Negro, the Chinese, the European. Two human beings whom the Bible knows as Adam and Eve were created, out of whom by natural descent and variation have come all the varieties of men that are on the face of the earth. All races of men, regardless of color or size, are one natural species. They all think alike, feel alike, are alike in physical structure, readily intermarry, and are capable of reproducing others of the same character. All races are descended from two common ancestors who came full-formed from the hand of the Creator.”g This is the testimony of Genesis 1:27, 28; 2:7, 20-23; 3:20; Acts 17:26; and Romans 5:12.
13. What did one archaeologist say about the focal point from which ancient languages spread?
13 As to the Bible’s account of the focal point from which the spreading of ancient languages began, the archaeologist Sir Henry Rawlinson said that “if we were to be thus guided by the mere intersection of linguistic paths, and independently of all reference to the scriptural record, we should still be led to fix on the plains of Shinar, as the focus from which the various lines had radiated.”h​—Gen. 11:1-9.
14. (a) What alone would set the Bible apart as inspired of God? (b) What rational view is presented only in the Bible, and how does its practicality extend to every phase of daily living?
14 (4) Practicality. If there were no other proofs of authenticity available, the Bible’s righteous principles and moral standards would set it apart as a product of the divine mind. Additionally, its practicality extends to every phase of daily living. No other book gives us a rational view of the origin of all things, including mankind, and of the Creator’s purpose toward the earth and man. (Gen., chap. 1; Isa. 45:18) The Bible tells us why man dies and why wickedness exists. (Gen., chap. 3; Rom. 5:12; Job, chaps. 1, 2; Ex. 9:16) It sets out the highest standard of justice. (Ex. 23:1, 2, 6, 7; Deut. 19:15-21) It gives right counsel on business dealings (Lev. 19:35, 36; Prov. 20:10; 22:22, 23; Matt. 7:12); clean moral conduct (Lev. 20:10-16; Gal. 5:19-23; Heb. 13:4); relationships with others (Lev. 19:18; Prov. 12:15; 15:1; 27:1, 2, 5, 6; 29:11; Matt. 7:12; 1 Tim. 5:1, 2); marriage (Gen. 2:22-24; Matt. 19:4, 5, 9; 1 Cor. 7:2, 9, 10, 39); family relationships and duties of husband, wife, and children (Deut. 6:4-9; Prov. 13:24; Eph. 5:21-33; 6:1-4; Col. 3:18-21; 1 Pet. 3:1-6); proper attitude toward rulers (Rom. 13:1-10; Titus 3:1; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2; 1 Pet. 2:13, 14); honest work as well as master-slave and employer-employee relationships (Eph. 4:28; Col. 3:22-24; 4:1; 1 Pet. 2:18-21); proper associations (Prov. 1:10-16; 5:3-11; 1 Cor. 15:33; 2 Tim. 2:22; Heb. 10:24, 25); settling disputes (Matt. 18:15-17; Eph. 4:26); and many other things that vitally affect our everyday lives.
15. What Bible counsel on mental and physical health has been shown to be practical?
15 The Bible also provides valuable pointers regarding physical and mental health. (Prov. 15:17; 17:22) In recent years, medical research has demonstrated that a person’s physical health is indeed affected by his mental attitude. For example, studies have shown that persons who are prone to express anger often have the highest levels of blood pressure. Some reported that anger produced cardiac sensations, headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, or inability to vocalize. However, the Bible long ago explained: “A calm heart is the life of the fleshly organism.”​—Prov. 14:30; compare Matthew 5:9.
16. What are some of the Bible statements of truth that far predate their discovery by science?
16 (5) Scientific Accuracy. Though the Bible is not a treatise on science, where it touches on scientific matters, it is found to be accurate and in harmony with true scientific discovery and knowledge. Its record of the order of creation, including animal life (Gen., chap. 1); the earth’s being round, or spherical (Isa. 40:22); and the earth’s hanging in space on “nothing” antedate scientific discoveries of these truths. (Job 26:7) Modern physiology has demonstrated the truth of the Scriptural statement that “not all flesh is the same flesh,” the cellular structure of the flesh of one kind being different from that of another, man having his own unique “flesh.” (1 Cor. 15:39)i In the field of zoology, Leviticus 11:6 classes the hare with the cud-chewing animals. This was once scoffed at, but science now finds that the rabbit reingests its food.j
17. How has the Bible been shown to be medically sound?
17 The statement that the ‘life of the flesh is in the blood’ has in modern times come to be recognized as a basic truth of medical science. (Lev. 17:11-14) The Mosaic Law indicated which animals, birds, and fish were “clean” for human consumption, and it excluded risky foods. (Lev., chap. 11) The Law required that at a military encampment, human excrement be covered over, thus providing considerable protection from fly-borne infectious diseases, such as dysentery and typhoid fever. (Deut. 23:9-14) Even today, in some lands severe health problems exist because of improper disposal of human wastes. People in such lands would be much healthier if they followed the Bible’s counsel on hygiene.
18. What other illustration of the Bible’s scientific accuracy is given?
18 The Bible recommends a little wine for “the sake of your stomach” and for “sickness.” (1 Tim. 5:23) Dr. Salvatore P. Lucia, professor of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine, writes: “Wine is the most ancient dietary beverage and the most important medicinal agent in continuous use throughout the history of mankind.”k
19. How may the accuracy of Luke’s writings be illustrated?
19 (6) Culture and Customs. A. Rendle Short writes in Modern Discovery and the Bible, about the book of Acts: “It was the Roman custom to govern the provinces of their far-flung empire by continuing as far as they safely could the local system of administration, and consequently the authorities in different districts went by many different names. No one, unless he were either an observant traveller or a painstaking student of records, could possibly give all these gentry their correct denomination. It is one of the most searching tests of Luke’s historical sense that he always manages to achieve perfect accuracy. In several cases it is only the evidence of a coin, or an inscription, that has given us the necessary information to check him; the recognized Roman historians do not adventure themselves on such a difficult terrain. Thus Luke calls Herod and Lysanias tetrarchs; so does Josephus. Herod Agrippa, who slew James with the sword and cast Peter into prison, is called a king; Josephus tells us how he became friendly at Rome with Gaius Cæsar (Caligula) and was rewarded with a royal title when Caligula came to be emperor. The governor of Cyprus, Sergius Paulus, is called proconsul. . . . Not long before, Cyprus had been an imperial province, and governed by a proprætor or legatus, but in Paul’s time, as is shown by Cyprian coins, both in Greek and Latin, the correct title was proconsul. A Greek inscription found at Soloi on the north coast of Cyprus is dated ‘in the proconsulship of Paulus’ . . . At Thessalonica the city magnates took the quite unusual title of politarchs [city rulers, Acts 17:6, footnote], a name unknown to classical literature. It would be quite unfamiliar to us, except from Luke’s use of it, if it were not for the fact that it appears in inscriptions. . . . Achaia under Augustus was a senatorial province, under Tiberius it was directly under the emperor, but under Claudius, as Tacitus tells us, it reverted to the senate, and therefore Gallio’s correct title [Acts 18:12] was proconsul. . . . Luke is equally happy, equally accurate, in his geography and his travel experiences.”l
20. How do Paul’s writings accurately reflect the times in which he lived and wrote?
20 Paul’s letters accurately reflect the background of his time and indicate that he was an eyewitness of the things written. For example, Philippi was a military colony whose citizens were especially proud of their Roman citizenship. Paul admonished the Christians there that their citizenship was in the heavens. (Acts 16:12, 21, 37; Phil. 3:20) Ephesus was a city noted for magical arts and spiritistic practices. Paul instructed Christians there as to how to arm themselves against becoming prey to the demons, and at the same time, he gave an accurate description of the armor of a Roman soldier. (Acts 19:19; Eph. 6:13-17) The custom of Roman victors of leading a triumphant march with a procession of captives, some naked, is used in illustration. (2 Cor. 2:14; Col. 2:15) At 1 Corinthians 1:22, the differing outlooks of Jews and Greeks are pointed out. In such matters the Christian writers reflect the accuracy of Moses, the writer of the Pentateuch, of which George Rawlinson says: “The ethological accuracy of the Pentateuch as respects Oriental manners and customs generally, has never been questioned.”a
21. (a) Give examples of the candor of the Bible writers. (b) How does this build confidence in the Bible as truth?
21 (7) Candor of Bible Writers. Throughout the Bible, the unhesitating candor of its writers is strong proof of its reliability. Moses, for example, straightforwardly tells of his own sin and God’s judgment that he and his brother, Aaron, should not enter the Promised Land. (Num. 20:7-13; Deut. 3:23-27) The sins of David on two occasions as well as the apostasy of his son Solomon are openly exposed. (2 Sam., chaps. 11, 12, 24; 1 Ki. 11:1-13) Jonah writes about his own disobedience and its result. The entire nation of Israel was condemned by nearly all the writers of the Hebrew Scriptures, all of whom were Jews, for its disobedience to God, in the very record the Jews cherished and accepted as the pronouncements of God and the true history of their nation. The Christian writers were no less candid. All four of the Gospel writers revealed Peter’s denial of Christ. And Paul called attention to Peter’s serious error on a matter of faith in making a separation between Jews and Gentiles in the Christian congregation at Antioch. It builds confidence in the Bible as truth when we realize that its writers spared no one, not even themselves, in the interests of making a faithful record.​—Matt. 26:69-75; Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:54-62; John 18:15-27; Gal. 2:11-14; John 17:17.
22. What else proves that the Bible is indeed God’s Word, and for what purpose was it written?
22 (8) Harmony of Writers. The Bible was written over a period of more than 1,600 years by about 40 writers, with no disharmony. It has been widely distributed in tremendous numbers despite the fiercest opposition and the most energetic efforts to destroy it. These facts help to prove that it is what it claims to be, the Word of the almighty God, and that it is indeed “beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”​—2 Tim. 3:16.b
23. What consistent theme also proves the Bible’s inspiration? Illustrate.
23 Its inspiration is shown by the thorough consistency with which it emphasizes the theme of sanctification of Jehovah’s name by his Kingdom under Christ. A few of the outstanding instances are:
Gen. 3:15                      Promise of the Seed that will                               destroy the Serpent
Gen. 22:15-18                  All nations will bless themselves                               by means of Abraham’s seed
Ex. 3:15; 6:3                  God emphasizes his memorial name,                               Jehovah
Ex. 9:16; Rom. 9:17            God states purpose to have his                               name declared
Ex. 18:11;                     Jehovah greater than all otherIsa. 36:18-20;37:20, 36-38;    godsJer. 10:10, 11
Ex. 20:3-7                     God respects name, demands                               exclusive devotion
Job, chaps. 1, 2               Jehovah’s rightful sovereignty                               and man’s attitude and integrity                               toward it
Job 32:2; 35:2; 36:24; 40:8    God’s vindication brought to the                               fore
Isa. 9:7                       God zealously supports                               everlasting Kingdom of his Son
Dan. 2:44; 4:17, 34;           The importance of God’s KingdomDan 7:13, 14                 by the “son of man”
Ezek. 6:10; 38:23              People “will have to know that I                               am Jehovah.” This statement                               appears more than 60 times in the                               prophecy of Ezekiel
Mal. 1:11                      God’s name to be great among the                               nations
Matt. 6:9, 10, 33              Sanctification of God’s name by                               his Kingdom is of primary importance
John 17:6, 26                  Jesus declared God’s name
Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:13          Jehovah’s name to be called on                               for salvation
Rom. 3:4                       God to be proved true, though                               every man a liar
1 Cor. 15:24-28                Kingdom to be handed back to God;                               God to be all things to everyone
Heb. 13:15                     Christians must make public                               declaration to Jehovah’s name
Rev. 15:4                      Jehovah’s name to be glorified by                               all nations
Rev. 19:6                      Jehovah’s name praised after                               devastation of Babylon the                               Great
24. (a) How does the integrity of the early Christians establish the truthfulness of “the Christian Story”? (b) What other proof is there that the Bible writers recorded facts, not myths?
24 (9) Integrity of Witnesses. Of the weight that may be accorded the testimony of early Christians​—the writers of the Christian Scriptures as well as others—​George Rawlinson says: “The early converts knew that they might at any time be called upon to undergo death for their religion. . . . Every early writer advocating Christianity, by the fact of his advocacy, braved the civil power, and rendered himself liable to a similar fate. When faith is a matter of life and death, men do not lightly take up with the first creed which happens to hit their fancy; nor do they place themselves openly in the ranks of a persecuted sect, unless they have well weighed the claims of the religion which it professes, and convinced themselves of its being the truth. It is clear that the early converts had means of ascertaining the historic accuracy of the Christian narrative very much beyond ourselves; they could examine and cross-question the witnesses​—compare their several accounts—​inquire how their statements were met by their adversaries​—consult Heathen documents of the time—​thoroughly and completely sift the evidence. . . . All this together​—and it must be remembered that the evidence is cumulative—​constitutes a body of proof such as is seldom producible with respect to any events belonging to remote times; and establishes beyond all reasonable doubt the truth of the Christian Story. In no single respect . . . has that story a mythic character. It is a single story, told without variation, whereas myths are fluctuating and multiform; it is blended inextricably with the civil history of the times, which it every where represents with extraordinary accuracy, whereas myths distort or supersede civil history; it is full of prosaic detail, which myths studiously eschew; it abounds with practical instruction of the plainest and simplest kind, whereas myths teach by allegory. . . . Simple earnestness, fidelity, painstaking accuracy, pure love of truth, are the most patent characteristics of the New Testament writers, who evidently deal with facts, not with fancies . . . They write ‘that we may know the certainty of those things’ which were ‘most surely believed’ in their day.”c​—Compare Luke 1:1, 4.
25. What outstandingly demonstrates the authenticity of the Bible?
25 An enthralling field covered by the Bible is that of divine prophecy. The authenticity of the Bible has been in no way as strikingly demonstrated as in the fulfillment of numerous prophecies, all showing the remarkable forevision of Jehovah in foretelling the future. This prophetic Word is indeed “a lamp shining in a dark place,” and paying attention to it will strengthen the faith of those who desire to survive until all Kingdom prophecy is fulfilled in God’s everlasting new world of righteousness. The three tables that follow add further proof of the Bible’s authenticity in showing many of these prophetic fulfillments, as well as the harmony of the entire Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. With the passage of time, the Bible shines forth more and more brilliantly as being truly “inspired of God and beneficial.”​—2 Pet. 1:19; 2 Tim. 3:16.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 1. What kind of history is contained in Daniel, and what does it highlight?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THIS day when all nations of earth stand on the brink of disaster, the book of Daniel brings to attention prophetic messages of momentous import. Whereas the Bible books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles are based on eyewitness records of the history of God’s typical kingdom (the Davidic dynasty), Daniel focuses on the nations of the world and gives forevisions of the power struggle of the great dynasties from Daniel’s time down till “the time of the end.” This is world history written in advance. It leads up to an absorbing climax in showing what comes to pass “in the final part of the days.” Like Nebuchadnezzar, the nations have to learn the hard way “that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind” and that finally he gives it to one “like a son of man,” the Messiah and Leader, Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 12:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:14-27:10:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:25-27:4:25" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 4:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 7:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:25-27:9:25" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 9:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:13-43:3:16" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> John 3:13-16</a>) By paying close attention to the prophetic fulfillments of the inspired book of Daniel, we will appreciate more fully Jehovah’s power of prophecy and his assurances of protection and blessing for his people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:19-61:1:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 2. What confirms that Daniel was an actual person, and during what eventful period did he prophesy?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The book is named after its writer. “Daniel” (Hebrew, <em>Da·ni·yeʼlʹ</em>) means “My Judge Is God.” Ezekiel, who lived at the same time, confirms that Daniel was an actual person, naming him along with Noah and Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 14:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:20-26:14:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:28:3-26:28:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 28:3</a>) Daniel dates the beginning of his book as “the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the king of Judah.” This was 618 B.C.E., Jehoiakim’s third year as <em>tributary king</em> to Nebuchadnezzar.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Daniel’s prophetic visions continued down to Cyrus’ third year, about 536 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:1-27:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Dan. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:1-27:2:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:1-27:10:1" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:4-27:10:4" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 4</a>) What eventful years were covered by Daniel’s life span! His early days were spent under God’s kingdom in Judah. Then, as a teenage prince, along with his noble Judean companions, he was taken to Babylon to live through the rise and fall of that third world power of Bible history. Daniel survived to serve as government official in the fourth world power, Medo-Persia. Daniel must have lived nearly one hundred years.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 3. What proves the canonicity and authenticity of the book of Daniel?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The book of Daniel has always been included in the Jewish catalog of inspired Scriptures. Fragments of Daniel have been found among those of the other canonical books in the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of which date from the first half of the first century B.C.E. However, an even more important proof of the book’s authenticity is to be found in the references to it in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Jesus specifically names Daniel in his prophecy on “the conclusion of the system of things,” wherein he makes several quotations from the book.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt 24:3</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:27-27:9:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 9:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:31-27:11:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11:31</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:11-27:12:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">12:11</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:15 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:14-41:13:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Mark 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Dan. 12:1</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Dan. 7:13, 14</a>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 4, 5. How has archaeology routed the assertions of higher critics regarding Daniel?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Though higher critics of the Bible have called in question the historicalness of Daniel’s book, archaeological finds over the years have completely routed their assertions. For example, these critics leveled scorn at Daniel’s statement that Belshazzar was king in Babylon at the time that Nabonidus was reputed to be ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:1-27:5:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:1</a>) Archaeology has now established beyond question that Belshazzar was an actual person and that he was a coregent of Nabonidus in the last years of the Babylonian Empire. For example, an ancient cuneiform text described as the “Verse Account of Nabonidus” clearly confirms that Belshazzar exercised kingly authority at Babylon and explains the manner of his becoming coruler with Nabonidus.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Other cuneiform evidence supports the view that Belshazzar exercised regal functions. A tablet, dated in the 12th year of Nabonidus, contains an oath made in the name of Nabonidus, the king, and Belshazzar, the king’s son, thus showing that Belshazzar ranked with his father.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> This is also of interest in explaining why Belshazzar offered to make Daniel “the third one in the kingdom” if he <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>could interpret the handwriting on the wall. Nabonidus would be considered the first, Belshazzar would be the second, and Daniel would be heralded as the third ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:16-27:5:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">5:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:29-27:5:29" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 29</a>) One researcher says: “Cuneiform allusions to Belshazzar have thrown so much light upon the role which he played that his place in history stands clearly revealed. There are many texts which indicate that Belshazzar almost equaled Nabonidus in position and prestige. Dual rulership during most of the last Neo-Babylonian reign is an established fact. Nabonidus exercised supreme authority from his court in Tema in Arabia, while Belshazzar acted as coregent in the homeland with Babylon as his center of influence. It is evident that Belshazzar was not a feeble viceroy; he was entrusted with ‘the kingship.’”<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Some have tried to discredit Daniel’s account of the fiery furnace (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:1-27:3:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">chap. 3</a>), saying that it is a legendary invention. An Old-Babylonian letter reads, in part: “Thus says Rîm-Sin your lord: Because he has cast the slave-lad into the oven, do you cast the slave into the furnace.” Interestingly, referring to it, G. R. Driver stated that this punishment “appears in the story of the Three Holy Men (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:6-27:3:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. III 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:15-27:3:15" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:19-27:3:27" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 19-27</a>).”<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 6. What two parts make up the book of Daniel?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The Jews included the book of Daniel, not with the Prophets, but with the Writings. On the other hand, the English Bible follows the catalog order of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> by placing Daniel between the major and the minor prophets. There are actually two parts to the book. The first of these, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:1-27:6:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">chapters 1 to 6</a>, gives in chronological order the experiences of Daniel and his companions in government service from 617 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS OF DANIEL</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 7. What leads to Daniel and his companions’ entering Babylonian government service?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> <strong>Preparation for State service</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:1-27:1:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1:1-21</a>). In 617 B.C.E. Daniel comes to Babylon with the captive Jews. The sacred utensils from Jerusalem’s temple come also, to be stored in a pagan treasure-house. Daniel and his three Hebrew companions are among the royal Judean youths chosen for a three-year course of training in the king’s palace. Resolved in his heart not to pollute himself with the king’s pagan delicacies and wine, Daniel proposes a ten-day test of a vegetable diet. The test turns out in favor of Daniel and his companions, and God gives them knowledge and wisdom. Nebuchadnezzar appoints the four to stand before him as counselors. The last verse of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:1-27:1:21" data-bid="20-1" class="b">chapter 1</a>, which may have been added long after the preceding portion was written, indicates that Daniel was still in royal service some 80 years after his going into exile, which would be in about 538 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 8. What dream and interpretation does God reveal to Daniel, and how does Nebuchadnezzar show his appreciation?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> <strong>Dream of the dreadful image</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:1-27:2:49" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2:1-49</a>). In the second year of his kingship (probably dating from Jerusalem’s destruction in 607 B.C.E.), Nebuchadnezzar is agitated by a dream. His magic-practicing priests are unable to reveal the dream and its interpretation. He offers them great gifts, but they protest that no one but the gods can show the king the thing that he is asking. The king becomes furious and orders that the wise men be put to death. Since the four Hebrews are included in this decree, Daniel asks for time to reveal the dream. Daniel and his companions pray to Jehovah for guidance. Jehovah reveals the dream and its meaning to Daniel, who then goes before the king and says: “There exists a God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to occur in the final part of the days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:28-27:2:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2:28</a>) Daniel describes the dream. It is about an immense image. The head of the image is of gold, its breasts and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of copper, and its legs of iron, with feet partly iron and partly clay. A stone strikes and crushes the image and becomes a large mountain to fill the whole earth. What does this mean? Daniel makes known that the king of Babylon is the head of gold. After his kingdom there will follow a second, a third, and a fourth. Finally, “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. . . . It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2:44</a>) In gratitude and appreciation, the king extols Daniel’s God as “a God of gods” and makes Daniel “ruler over all the jurisdictional district of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.” Daniel’s three companions are made administrators in the kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:47-27:2:48" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2:47, 48</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 9. What results from the three Hebrews’ bold stand against image worship?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span id="page140" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="140" data-before-text="140"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> <strong>Three Hebrews survive the fiery furnace</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:1-27:3:30" data-bid="25-1" class="b">3:1-30</a>). Nebuchadnezzar erects a mighty image of gold, 60 cubits (88 ft) high, and orders the rulers of the empire to assemble for its dedication. At the sound of special music, all are to fall down and worship the image. Any who fail to do so are to be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. It is reported that Daniel’s three companions, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, have failed to comply. They are brought before the enraged king, where they boldly testify: “Our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. . . . The image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:17-27:3:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">3:17, 18</a>) Filled with fury, the king orders that the furnace be heated seven times more than customary and that the three Hebrews be bound and thrown in. As they do this, the would-be executioners are killed by the fiery flame. Nebuchadnezzar becomes frightened. What is this he sees in the furnace? Four men are walking about unharmed in the midst of the fire, and “the fourth one is resembling a son of the gods.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:25-27:3:25" data-bid="27-1" class="b">3:25</a>) The king calls on the three Hebrews to step out of the fire. Out they come, unsinged, without even the smell of fire itself upon them! As a result of their courageous stand for true worship, Nebuchadnezzar proclaims freedom of worship for the Jews throughout the empire.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">10. What frightening dream involving “seven times” did Nebuchadnezzar have, and was it fulfilled upon him?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> <strong>Dream of the “seven times”</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:1-27:4:37" data-bid="28-1" class="b">4:1-37</a>). This dream appears in the record as Daniel’s transcription of a state document of Babylon. It was written by the humbled Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar first acknowledges the might and kingdom of the Most High God. Then he relates a frightening dream and how it was fulfilled upon him. He saw a tree that reached to heaven and provided shelter and food for all flesh. A watcher called out: ‘Chop the tree down. Band its stump with iron and copper. Let seven times pass over it, so that it will be known that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and sets up over it the lowliest one of mankind.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:14-27:4:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">4:14-17</a>) Daniel interpreted the dream, making known that the tree represented Nebuchadnezzar. A fulfillment of this prophetic dream soon followed. At a time of expressing great pride, the king was afflicted with madness; and he lived as a beast in the field for seven years. After that, his sanity was restored, and he acknowledged Jehovah’s supremacy.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">11. During what debauchery does Belshazzar see the fateful handwriting, how does Daniel interpret it, and how is it fulfilled?</p>

It is the fateful night of October 5, 539 B.C.E. King Belshazzar, son of Nabonidus, as coregent of Babylon, makes a big feast for a thousand of his grandees. The king, under the influence of wine, calls for the sacred gold and silver vessels from Jehovah’s temple, and from these Belshazzar and his guests drink, in their debauchery, while praising their pagan gods. Immediately a hand appears and writes a cryptic message on the wall. The king is terrified. His wise men cannot interpret the writing. Finally Daniel is brought in. The king offers to make him the third one in the kingdom if he can read and interpret the writing, but Daniel tells him to keep his gifts to himself. Then he goes on to make known the writing and its meaning: “MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN. . . . God has numbered the days of your kingdom and has finished it. . . . You have been weighed in the balances and have been found deficient. . . . Your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:25-27:5:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b">5:25-28</a>) That very night Belshazzar is killed, and Darius the Mede receives the kingdom.</p>

High officials in Darius’ government frame mischief against Daniel by having the king pass a law that places a 30-day prohibition on making a petition to any god or man other than the king. Anyone disobeying it is to be thrown to the lions. Daniel refuses to obey this law affecting his worship and turns to Jehovah in prayer. He is thrown into the lions’ pit. Miraculously, Jehovah’s angel shuts the mouths of the lions, and next morning King Darius is glad to find Daniel unharmed. The enemies are now fed to the lions, and the king issues a decree to fear the God of Daniel, as “he is the living God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:26-27:6:26" data-bid="33-1" class="b">6:26</a>) Daniel prospers in government service on into the reign of Cyrus.</p>

The ram stands for the kings of Media and Persia. The he-goat is the king of Greece, whose kingdom will be broken into four. Later, a king of fierce countenance will stand up “against the Prince of princes.” Since the vision “is yet for many days,” Daniel must keep it secret for the present.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:25-27:8:26" data-bid="39-1" class="b">8:25, 26</a>.</p>

<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">20. What four visions are recorded concerning the world powers, and why is it faith-strengthening to consider these today?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Daniel’s visions are thrilling and faith-strengthening to review. First, consider the four visions concerning the world powers: (1) There is the vision of the dreadful image, whose head of gold represents the dynasty of Babylonian kings starting with Nebuchadnezzar, after which three other kingdoms rise, as pictured by the other parts of the image. These are the kingdoms that are crushed by the “stone,” which in its turn becomes “a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin,” God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:31-27:2:45" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2:31-45</a>) (2) There follow Daniel’s private visions, the first being that of the four beasts, representing “four kings.” These are like a lion, a bear, a leopard with four heads, and a beast that has big teeth of iron, ten horns, and later a small horn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:8" data-bid="53-1" class="b">7:1-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:17-27:7:28" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 17-28</a>) (3) Next, there is the vision of the ram (Medo-Persia), the he-goat (Greece), and the small horn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:1-27:8:27" data-bid="54-1" class="b">8:1-27</a>) (4) Finally, we have the vision of the king of the south and the king of the north. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:5-27:11:19" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Daniel 11:5-19</a> accurately describes the rivalry between the Egyptian and Seleucid offshoots of Alexander’s Grecian Empire following Alexander’s death in 323 B.C.E. From <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:11:20" data-bid="56-1" class="b">11 verse 20</a> the prophecy continues to trace the course of successor nations of the south and north. Jesus’ reference to “the disgusting thing that is causing desolation” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:31-27:11:31" data-bid="57-1" class="b">11:31</a>), in his prophecy about the sign of his presence, shows that this power struggle of the two kings continues right down to “the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3</a>) How comforting the prophecy’s assurance that in the “time of distress such as has not been made to occur since there came to be a nation until that time,” Michael himself will stand up to remove ungodly nations and bring peace to obedient mankind!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:12:1" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Dan. 11:20–12:1</a>.</p>

Remarkably, 483 years (69 times 7 years) after “the going forth of the word” to rebuild Jerusalem, as authorized by Artaxerxes in his 20th year and put into effect by Nehemiah in Jerusalem, Jesus of Nazareth was baptized in the Jordan River and anointed with holy spirit, becoming Christ, or Messiah (that is, Anointed One).<span data-fnid="8" class="fn">h<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="8"></span></span> That was in the year 29 C.E.

He was made to live as a beast of the field until he recognized “that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that to the one whom he wants to he gives it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:32-27:4:32" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Dan. 4:32</a>) Are we today going to be like Nebuchadnezzar, boasting in our achievements and placing our confidence in the might of men, so that God has to mete out punishment to us, or will we wisely acknowledge that He is the Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and place our confidence in his Kingdom?</p>

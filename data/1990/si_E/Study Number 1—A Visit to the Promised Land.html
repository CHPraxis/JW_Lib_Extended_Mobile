<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu"> 1. (a) Why is the designation “Promised Land” most appropriate? (b) What glorious prospect may we have in mind as we examine the geography of the land?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE boundaries of the ancient Promised Land were set by Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:31-2:23:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 23:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:1-4:34:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Num. 34:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:4-6:1:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Josh. 1:4</a>) For many centuries this area was referred to by some as the land of Palestine, a name derived from the Latin <em>Palaestina</em> and the Greek <em>Pa·lai·stiʹne.</em> This latter word is drawn from the Hebrew <em>Peleʹsheth.</em> In the Hebrew Scriptures, <em>Peleʹsheth</em> is translated “Philistia,” and it has reference just to the territory of the Philistines, who were enemies of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:14-2:15:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 15:14</a>) However, since Jehovah promised this land to faithful Abraham and his descendants, the designation “Promised Land,” or “Land of Promise,” is most appropriate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:9:27-5:9:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deut. 9:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:9-58:11:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:9</a>) This land is remarkable in the variety of its geography, wrapping up in this small area many of the distinct features and extremes that are to be found throughout the earth. If Jehovah could give as an inheritance to his ancient witnesses such a land of promise with all its beauteous variety, then certainly he can yet give to his dedicated worshipers a glorious new world paradise extending earth wide, with mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes, to bring them delight. Let us now pay keen attention to the geographic features of the Land of Promise, as we visit on an imaginary tour.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> According to its God-given boundaries as stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:1-4:34:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Numbers 34:1-12</a>, the land promised to Israel was to be a thin strip of territory. It was to be about 300 miles <strong>[480 km]</strong> from north to south and about 35 miles <strong>[56 km]</strong> wide, on the average. It was not until the reigns of Kings David and Solomon that the entire area promised was occupied militarily, with the placing of many subject peoples under control. However, the portion actually settled by the Jews is generally described as that covering from Dan to Beer-sheba, which was a distance of about 150 miles <strong>[240 km]</strong> from north to south. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:25-11:4:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:25</a>) The distance across the country from Mount Carmel to the Sea of Galilee is about 32 miles <strong>[51 km]</strong>, and in the south where the Mediterranean shoreline curves gradually to the southwest, it is over 50 miles <strong>[80 km]</strong> from Gaza to the Dead Sea. This settled area west of the Jordan River contained only about 6,000 square miles <strong>[15,000 sq. km]</strong>. However, the Israelites additionally settled in lands to the east of the Jordan (lands not included in the original promised boundaries), to make the total of settled territory a little less than 10,000 square miles <strong>[26,000 sq. km]</strong>.</p>

In Hebrew times oak forests grew in the northern part of Sharon. Many flocks grazed there after the grain was cut. It is for this reason that it was called the pasture grounds of Sharon.

The surface of the lake is about 700 feet <strong>[210 m]</strong> below sea level, resulting in pleasant, warm winters and very long, hot summers. In the days of Jesus, it was the center of a highly developed fishing industry, and the thriving cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, and Tiberias were located on or near the shore of the lake. The peacefulness of the lake can be quickly disturbed by storms. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:23-42:8:23" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Luke 8:23</a>) The little plain of Gennesaret, triangular in shape, is located to the northwest of the lake.

The plains in the northern part of The Ghor, or Arabah, are well cultivated. Even in the southern part, toward the Dead Sea, the plateau of the Arabah, which is today very arid, at one time is said to have produced numerous kinds of dates, as well as many other tropical fruits. Jericho was and still is the most famous city in the Jordan Valley.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:2-6:6:2" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Josh. 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:20-6:6:20" data-bid="87-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:46-41:10:46" data-bid="87-3" class="b"> Mark 10:46</a>.</p>

It is fittingly called dead, for no fish live in the sea and there is little vegetation by its shore. The Bible calls it the Salt Sea, or the Sea of the Arabah, since it is located in the rift valley of the Arabah.

Its surface is about 1,300 feet <strong>[400 m]</strong> below that of the Mediterranean Sea, making it the lowest spot on earth. In its northern part, it has a depth of about 1,300 feet <strong>[400 m]</strong>. On each side, the sea is shut in by barren hills and steep cliffs. Although the Jordan River brings in fresh water, there is no water outlet except by evaporation, which is as fast as the water intake. The trapped water contains about 25 percent dissolved solid matter, mostly salt, and is poisonous to fish and painful to human eyes. Visitors to most of the area around the Dead Sea are often overwhelmed by a sense of desolation and destruction. It is a place of the dead. Though the entire region was once “a well-watered region . . . like the garden of Jehovah,” the area around the Dead Sea is now largely “a desolate waste” and has been such for close to 4,000 years, as striking testimony to the unchangeableness of Jehovah’s judgments that were executed there against Sodom and Gomorrah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:10-1:13:10" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Gen. 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:27-1:19:29" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 19:27-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:9-36:2:9" data-bid="89-3" class="b"> Zeph. 2:9</a>.</p>

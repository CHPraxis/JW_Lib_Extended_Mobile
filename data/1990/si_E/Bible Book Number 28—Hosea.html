<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE last 12 books of the Hebrew Scriptures are commonly referred to as “the minor prophets.” The expression in common use in Germany, “the little prophets,” would seem to be more appropriate, for these books are certainly not minor in importance, although their combined length is still less than that of Isaiah or Jeremiah. In the Hebrew Bible, they were considered as one volume and called “The Twelve.” Their collection together in this manner was probably for the purpose of preservation, since a single small roll might have been easily lost. As with each of these 12 books, the first one is named after its writer, Hosea, whose name is a shortened form of Hoshaiah, meaning “Saved by Jah; Jah Has Saved.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> In the book bearing his name, little is revealed concerning Hosea except that he was the son of Beeri. His prophecies concern Israel almost exclusively, Judah being mentioned only in passing; and while Jerusalem is not mentioned by Hosea, Israel’s dominant tribe, Ephraim, is spoken of by name 37 times and Israel’s capital, Samaria, 6 times.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3. For how long did Hosea prophesy, and who were other prophets of this period?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The first verse of the book tells us that Hosea served as Jehovah’s prophet for an unusually long time, from near the end of the reign of Israel’s King Jeroboam II on into the reign of Hezekiah of Judah. That is from no later than 804 B.C.E. until after 745 B.C.E., no less than 59 years. His time of prophetic service no doubt spread over some years into the reigns of Jeroboam II and Hezekiah. During this time Amos, Isaiah, Micah, and Oded were other faithful prophets of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:1-30:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:1-33:1:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Mic. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:9-14:28:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The authenticity of the prophecy is confirmed by its being quoted a number of times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Jesus himself quoted <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:8-28:10:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hosea 10:8</a> in pronouncing judgment on Jerusalem: “Then they will start to say to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:30-42:23:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 23:30</a>) This same passage is partially quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:16-66:6:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 6:16</a>. Matthew quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:1-28:11:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 11:1</a> in showing the fulfillment of the prophecy: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:15-40:2:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 2:15</a>) Hosea’s prophecy of the restoration of <em>all</em> Israel was fulfilled in that many from the ten-tribe kingdom joined with Judah before its captivity and their descendants were among those who returned after the exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:11-28:1:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hos. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:13-14:11:17" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 11:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:6-14:30:12" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 30:6-12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:18-14:30:18" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:25-14:30:25" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:70-15:2:70" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> Ezra 2:70</a>) From the time of Ezra, the book has occupied its rightful place in the Hebrew canon as “the word of Jehovah by Hosea.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hos. 1:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5. Because of what unfaithfulness did Jehovah punish Israel?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Why did Jehovah send Hosea as his prophet to Israel? It was because of Israel’s unfaithfulness and contamination with Baal worship, in violation of Jehovah’s covenant. In the Promised Land, Israel had become an agricultural people, but in doing so they adopted not only the Canaanites’ way of life but also their religion with its worship of Baal, a god symbolic of the reproductive forces of nature. In Hosea’s day Israel had turned completely from the worship of Jehovah to a riotous, drunken ceremonial that included immoral relations with temple prostitutes. Israel attributed prosperity to Baal. She was disloyal to Jehovah, unworthy of him, and therefore had to be disciplined. Jehovah was going to show her that her material possessions were not from Baal, and so he sent Hosea to warn Israel what failure to repent would mean. After Jeroboam II died, Israel faced her most terrible period. A reign of terror, with a number of rulers being assassinated, continued down until the Assyrian captivity in 740 B.C.E. During this time, two factions fought each other, one wanting to form an alliance with Egypt, and the other, with Assyria. Neither group trusted in Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6. What is revealing about Hosea’s style of writing?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Hosea’s style of writing is revealing. He is often tender and sensitive in his wording and repeatedly emphasizes Jehovah’s loving-kindness and mercy. He dwells on each small sign of repentance that he sees. His language is at other times <span id="page144" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>abrupt and impulsive. What he lacks in rhythm, he makes up for in force and power. He expresses very strong feeling, and he changes thought rapidly.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7. What is illustrated in Gomer’s unfaithfulness and her later recovery?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> At the outset of his prophetic career, Hosea was commanded to take “a wife of fornication.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1:2</a>) Certainly Jehovah had a purpose in this. Israel had been to Jehovah like a wife who had become unfaithful, committing fornication. Yet he would show his love for her and try to recover her. Hosea’s wife, Gomer, could accurately illustrate this. It is understood that after the birth of the first child, she became unfaithful and apparently bore the other children in adultery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:5-28:2:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2:5-7</a>) This is indicated by the record’s stating she “bore to <em>him</em> [Hosea] a son” but omitting any reference to the prophet in connection with the birth of the other two children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:3-28:1:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:6-28:1:6" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:8-28:1:8" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 8</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Chapter 3, verses 1-3</a>, seems to speak of Hosea’s taking back Gomer, purchasing her as though a slave, and this ties in with Jehovah’s taking back his people after they repented of their adulterous course.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 8. What names are used interchangeably in the book?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> The ten-tribe northern kingdom of Israel, to whom the words of Hosea’s prophecy are principally directed, was also known as Ephraim, after the name of the dominant tribe in the kingdom. These names, Israel and Ephraim, are used interchangeably in the book.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. What do the names of Gomer’s children indicate as to how Jehovah would deal with Israel?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> <strong>Israel’s adulterous course illustrated</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:1-28:3:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1:1–3:5</a>). Hosea’s “wife of fornication” bears the prophet a son, Jezreel. Later she has two other children, a daughter, Lo-ruhamah, meaning “[She Was] Not Shown Mercy,” and a son, Lo-ammi, meaning “Not My People.” These two names Jehovah gave to indicate that he would “no more show mercy again to the house of Israel” and to emphasize his rejection of them as a whole as his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:6-28:1:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:9-28:1:9" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 9</a>) Yet, the sons of Judah and Israel, as “sons of the living God,” are to be gathered in unity under one head, “because great will be the day of Jezreel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:10-28:1:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1:10, 11</a>) Cleansed of adulterous Baal worship, God’s people will return to Jehovah and accept him as their husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:16-28:2:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2:16</a>) Jehovah will give security to Israel and will engage her to him for time indefinite in righteousness, in justice, in loving-kindness, in mercies, and in faithfulness. In harmony with the name Jezreel (meaning “God Will Sow Seed”), Jehovah promises: “I shall certainly sow her like seed for me in the earth, . . . and I will say to those not my people: ‘You are my people’; and they, for their part, will say: ‘You are my God.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:23-28:2:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2:23</a>) Like a wife repentant of her adultery, “Israel will come back and certainly look for Jehovah their God, and for David their king.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:5-28:3:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">3:5</a>.</p>

The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:1-28:4:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">first verse of chapter 4</a> gives the setting for the prophetic warnings that follow: “Jehovah has a legal case with the inhabitants of the land, for there is no truth nor loving-kindness nor knowledge of God in the land.” What will result from this condition? “Because the knowledge is what you yourself have rejected, I shall also reject you from serving as a priest to me; and because you keep forgetting the law of your God, I shall forget your sons, even I,” says Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:1-28:4:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:6-28:4:6" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 6</a>) The very spirit of fornication has caused Israel to wander away.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11. How does Hosea plead with the people, but why is it woe to them?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Hosea pleads with the people: “Let us return to Jehovah, for . . . he will heal us.” Jehovah delights in loving-kindness and divine knowledge rather than in sacrifices and burnt offerings, but the loving-kindness of Ephraim and Judah is “like the dew that early goes away.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:1-28:6:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">6:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:6:4-28:6:4" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Ephraim is “like a simpleminded dove without heart.” The people go to Egypt and to Assyria for aid rather than to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:7:11-28:7:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">7:11</a>) It is woe to them. Why? They are loafing about, scheming bad things, overstepping Jehovah’s covenant, and transgressing his law. “For it is wind that they keep sowing, and a storm wind is what they will reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:8:7-28:8:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">8:7</a>) Jehovah will remember their error and give attention to their sins. “They will become fugitives among the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:9:17-28:9:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">9:17</a>) Israel is a degenerating vine whose heart has become hypocritical. Instead of sowing seed in righteousness and reaping in accord with loving-kindness, Israel has plowed wickedness and reaped unrighteousness. “Out of Egypt I called my son,” reminds Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:1-28:11:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">11:1</a>) Yes, He loved Israel from his boyhood, but Israel has surrounded Him with lying and deception.

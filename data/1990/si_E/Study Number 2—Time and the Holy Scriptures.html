<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 1, 2. What did Solomon write concerning time, and in view of the fleeting nature of time, what should we do with it?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>MAN is deeply conscious of the passing of time. With each tick of the clock, he progresses a step farther down time’s corridor. He is wise, indeed, if he makes proper use of his time. As King Solomon wrote: “For everything there is an appointed time, even a time for every affair under the heavens: a time for birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot what was planted; a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build; a time to weep and a time to laugh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1-4</a>) How fleeting is time! The 70 years of the normal life span is far too short a time for a person to take in the abundance of knowledge and to enjoy all the other good things Jehovah has provided for man on this earth. “Everything he has made pretty in its time. Even time indefinite he has put in their heart, that mankind may never find out the work that the true God has made from the start to the finish.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps. 90:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Jehovah himself lives in an eternity of time. As for his creatures, it has pleased him to set them in the stream of time. The angels of heaven, including even the rebellious Satan, are fully aware of the passage of time.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> <strong>Time Is One-Directional.</strong> Though time is universal, no man living is able to say what it is. It is as unfathomable as space. No one can explain where the stream of time began or where it is flowing. These things belong to the limitless knowledge of Jehovah, who is described as being God “from time indefinite to time indefinite.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 90:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> On the other hand, time has certain characteristics that can be understood. Its apparent rate of flow can be measured. Additionally, it moves in one direction only. Like traffic on a one-way street, time moves relentlessly in that one direction​—onward, ever onward. Whatever the speed of its forward movement, time can never be thrown into reverse. We live in a momentary present. However, this present is in motion, flowing continually into the past. There is no stopping it.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 5. Why may it be said that the past has been won or lost?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> <strong>The Past.</strong> The past is gone, it is history, and it can never be repeated.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:25-23:43:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 43:25</a>) In like manner, a man’s good deeds in the past have made a record that “will come back to him” with blessing from Jehovah.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> <strong>The Future.</strong> The future is different. It is always flowing toward us. By the help of God’s Word, we can identify obstacles that loom ahead of us and prepare to meet them. We can store up for ourselves “treasures in heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:20-40:6:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 6:20</a>) These treasures will not be swept away by the stream of time.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 7. What time indicators has Jehovah provided for man?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong>Time Indicators.</strong> Our modern-day watches and clocks are time indicators. They serve as rulers for measuring time. In similar manner Jehovah, the Creator, has set in motion giant time indicators​—the earth spinning on its axis, the moon revolving around the earth, and the sun—​so that from his standpoint on earth, man may be accurately advised of the time. “And God went on to say: ‘Let luminaries come to be in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night; and they must serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14</a>) Thus, as a multitude of objects with interlocking purposes, these heavenly bodies move in their perfect cycles, unendingly and unerringly measuring the one-directional movement of time.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 8. In what different senses is the word “day” used in the Bible?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> <strong>Day.</strong> The word “day” in the Bible is used with several different meanings, even as it has a variety of applications in modern times. As the earth makes one complete rotation on its axis, it measures out one day of 24 hours. In this sense, a day is made up of daytime and nighttime, a total of 24 hours. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:19-43:20:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 20:19</a>) However, the daylight period itself, usually averaging 12 hours, is also called day. “And God began calling the light Day, but the darkness he called Night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:5-1:1:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 1:5</a>) This gives rise to the time term “night,” the period usually averaging 12 hours of darkness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:13-2:10:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 10:13</a>) Another sense is where the word “day(s)” refers to a period of time contemporaneous with some outstanding person. For example, Isaiah saw his vision “in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 1:1</a>), and the days of Noah and of Lot are mentioned as being prophetic. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:26-42:17:30" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 17:26-30</a>) Another example of the flexible or figurative use of the word “day” is Peter’s saying that “one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:8-61:3:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:8</a>) In the Genesis account, the creative day is an even longer period of time​—millenniums. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:2-1:2:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:11-2:20:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:11</a>) The Bible context indicates the sense in which the word “day” applies.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 9. (a) How did the division of the day into 24 hours of 60 minutes each originate? (b) What time indicators are mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures?</p>

Our modern-day division of the hour into 60 minutes originated from Babylonian mathematics, which was a sexagesimal system (based on the number 60). There is no mention of division into hours in the Hebrew Scriptures.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Instead of dividing the day into specific hours, the Hebrew Scriptures use expressions such as “morning,” “noon,” “midday,” and “evening time” as time indicators.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> There is, however, frequent mention of the “hour” in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

This would correspond to our 12 noon. Jesus’ expiration in death on the torture stake is stated to have occurred “about the ninth hour,” or about 3 p.m.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:25-41:15:25" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Mark 15:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:44-42:23:44" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 23:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:45-40:27:46" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Matt. 27:45, 46</a>.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> <strong>Lunar Months.</strong> The Bible speaks of “lunar months.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:2-2:2:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:13-5:21:13" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Deut. 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:14-5:33:14" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 33:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:15-15:6:15" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Ezra 6:15</a>) Our modern months are not lunar months, for they are not determined by the moon. They are merely 12 arbitrary divisions of the solar year. A lunar month is a month that is determined by the new moon. There are four phases of the moon, which make up one lunation averaging 29 days, 12 hours, and 44 minutes.

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">13. How was the Flood accurately recorded as to time?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Instead of using strictly lunar months, Noah appears to have recorded events by months of 30 days each. By the log that Noah kept on the ark, we understand that the waters of the Flood kept overwhelming the earth for a period of five months, or “a hundred and fifty days.” It was after 12 months and 10 days that the earth had dried off so that the ark’s passengers could go out. Thus, those epoch-making events were accurately recorded as to time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Gen. 7:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:24-1:7:24" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:3-1:8:4" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 8:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:14-1:8:19" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 14-19</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:14" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14</a>) These follow as a consequence of the earth’s being tilted, or inclined, at a 23.5° angle to the plane of its travel around the sun. This results in first the Southern Hemisphere’s and then, six months later, the Northern Hemisphere’s being tilted toward the sun, so that the seasons proceed in order. This change of the seasons provides for variety and contrast and controls the times for planting and harvesting. God’s Word assures us that this arrangement for change and contrast of the seasons through the year is to continue forever. “For all the days the earth continues, seed sowing and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, will never cease.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:22-1:8:22" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Gen. 8:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> <strong>Bible Years.</strong> According to the ancient Biblical reckoning, the year ran from autumn to autumn. This was particularly suited to an agricultural life, the year beginning with plowing and sowing, toward the first part of our month of October, and ending with the gathering in of the harvest. Noah counted the year as beginning in the autumn. He recorded the Deluge as beginning “in the second month,” which would correspond to the latter half of October and the first half of November. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Gen. 7:11</a>, footnote) To this day, many peoples of the earth still start their new year in the autumn. At the time of the Exodus from Egypt, in 1513 B.C.E., Jehovah decreed that Abib (Nisan) should become “the start of the months” for the Jews, so that they now had a sacred year, running from spring to spring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:2-2:12:2" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ex. 12:2</a>) However, Jews in our day observe a secular, or civil, year beginning in the autumn, Tishri being the first month.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">20. How was the lunar year adjusted to correspond to the solar year, and what are lunisolar years?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> <strong>Lunisolar Year.</strong> Until the time of Christ, most nations used lunar years for counting time, employing various ways of adjusting the year to coincide more or less with the solar year. The common lunar year of 12 lunar months has 354 days, with the months having 29 or 30 days, depending on the appearance of each new moon. The lunar year is therefore about 11 1/4 days short of the true solar year of 365 1/4 days. The Hebrews followed the lunar year. Just how they adjusted this year to coincide with the solar year and the seasons is not explained in the Bible, but they must have added additional, or intercalary, months when needed. The arrangement of intercalary months was later systematized in the fifth century B.C.E. into what is now known as the Metonic cycle. This allowed for the intercalary month to be added seven times every 19 years, and in the Jewish calendar, it was added after the 12th month, Adar, and was called Veadar, or “second Adar.” As the lunar calendar is thus adjusted to the sun, the years, which are of 12 or 13 months, are known as lunisolar years.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">21. (a) What is the Julian calendar? (b) Why is the Gregorian calendar more accurate?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> <strong>Julian and Gregorian Calendars.</strong> A calendar is a system of fixing the beginning, length, and divisions of the year and arranging these divisions in order. The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.E., to give the Roman people a solar-year time arrangement in place of the lunar year. The Julian calendar consists of 365 days in a year, with the exception that on each fourth year (leap year), one day is added, to make it 366 days. However, in the course of time, it was found that the Julian calendar year is actually a little more than 11 minutes longer than the true solar year. By the 16th century C.E., a discrepancy <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>of ten full days had accumulated. Thus, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced a slight revision, instituting what is now known as the Gregorian calendar. By papal bull ten days were omitted from the year 1582, so that the day after October 4 became October 15. The Gregorian calendar provides that centuries not divisible by 400 are not to be considered leap years. For example, unlike the year 2000, the year 1900 was not made a leap year because the number 1,900 is not divisible by 400. The Gregorian calendar is now the one in general use in most parts of the world.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> <strong>Prophetic “Year.”</strong> In Bible prophecy the word “year” is often used in a special sense as the equivalent of 12 months, each month having 30 days, for a total of 360 days. Note what one authority says in commenting on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:5-26:4:6" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:5, 6</a>: “We must suppose that Ezekiel knew a year of 360 days.

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">24. How did many ancient peoples start their counting?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> <strong>No Zero Year.</strong> Ancient peoples, including the learned Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews, had no concept of zero. To them, everything began counting from one. When you studied Roman numerals in school (I, II, III, IV, V, X, etc.), did you learn a figure for zero? No, because the Romans had none. Since the Romans did not use the number zero, the Common Era began, not with a zero year, but with 1 C.E. This also gave rise to the ordinal arrangement of numbers, such as first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd), tenth (10th), and hundredth (100th). In modern mathematics, man conceives of everything as starting from nothing, or zero. The zero was probably invented by the Hindus.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">25. How do ordinal numbers differ from cardinal numbers?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Thus it is that whenever <em>ordinal</em> numbers are used, we must always subtract one to get the full number. For example, when we speak of a date in the 20th century C.E., does it mean that there have been a full 20 centuries? No, it means 19 full centuries plus some years. To express full numbers, the Bible, as well as modern mathematics, employs <em>cardinal</em> numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 10, and 100. These are also called “whole numbers.”</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">26. How would you figure (a) the years from October 1, 607 B.C.E., to October 1, 1914 C.E.? (b) 2,520 years from October 1, 607 B.C.E.?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Now, since the Common Era did not begin with the year zero but began with 1 C.E., and the calendar for the years before the Common Era did not count back from a zero year but began with 1 B.C.E., the figure used for the year in any date is in reality an ordinal number. That is, 1990 C.E. really represents 1989 full years since the beginning of the Common Era, and the date July 1, 1990, represents 1,989 years plus a half year since the beginning of the Common Era. The same principle applies to B.C.E. dates. So to figure how many years elapsed between October 1, 607 B.C.E., and October 1, 1914 C.E., add 606 years (plus the last three months of the previous year) to 1,913 (plus the first nine months of the next year), and the result is 2,519 (plus 12 months), or 2,520 years. Or if you want to figure what date would be 2,520 years after October 1, 607 B.C.E., remember that 607 is an ordinal number​—it really represents 606 full years—​and since we are counting, not from December 31, 607 B.C.E., but from October 1, 607 B.C.E., we must add to 606 the three months at the end of 607 B.C.E. Now subtract 606 1/4 from 2,520 years. The remainder is 1,913 3/4. That means that 2,520 years from October 1, 607 B.C.E., takes us 1,913 3/4 years into the Common Era​—1,913 full years brings us to the beginning of 1914 C.E., and three fourths of a year in addition brings us to October 1, 1914 C.E.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">27. What are pivotal dates, and why are they of great value?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> <strong>Pivotal Dates.</strong> Reliable Bible chronology is based on certain pivotal dates. A pivotal date is a calendar date in history that has a sound basis for acceptance and that corresponds to a specific event recorded in the Bible. It can then be used as the starting point from which a series of Bible events can be located on the calendar with certainty. Once this pivotal point is fixed, calculations forward or backward from this date are made from accurate records in the Bible itself, such as the stated life spans of people or the duration of the reigns of kings. Thus, starting from a pegged point, we can use the reliable internal chronology of the Bible itself in dating many Bible events.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">28. What pivotal date is provided for the Hebrew Scriptures?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> <strong>Pivotal Date for the Hebrew Scriptures.</strong> A prominent event recorded both in the Bible and in secular history is the overthrow of the city of Babylon by the Medes and Persians under Cyrus. The Bible records this event at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:30-27:5:30" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Daniel 5:30</a>. Various historical sources (including Diodorus, Africanus, <span id="page283" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="283" data-before-text="283"></span>Eusebius, Ptolemy, and the Babylonian tablets) support 539 B.C.E. as the year for the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus. The Nabonidus Chronicle gives the month and day of the city’s fall (the year is missing).

In view of the Bible record, the decree was likely made late in 538 B.C.E. or toward the spring of 537 B.C.E. This would give ample opportunity for the Jews to resettle in their homeland and to come up to Jerusalem to restore the worship of Jehovah in “the seventh month,” Tishri, or about October 1, 537 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:1-15:1:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:1-15:3:6" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 3:1-6</a>.<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span></p>

If the years were counted from the death of Augustus, the 15th year ran from August of 28 C.E. to August of 29 C.E. If counted from when Tiberius was named emperor by the Senate, the year ran from September of 28 C.E. to September of 29 C.E. Soon after this, Jesus, who was about six months younger than John the Baptizer, came to be baptized, when he was “about thirty years old.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:2-42:3:2" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Luke 3:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:23" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:34-42:1:38" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> 1:34-38</a>) This agrees with the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:25-27:9:25" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> that 69 “weeks” (prophetic weeks of 7 years each, thus totaling 483 years) would elapse from “the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem” and its wall until the appearance of Messiah.

And 483 years later, in the latter part of 29 C.E., when he was baptized by John, Jesus was also anointed by holy spirit from God, thus becoming the Messiah, or Anointed One. That Jesus was baptized and began his ministry in the latter part of the year also agrees with the prophecy that he was to be cut off “at the half of the week” of years (or after three and a half years).

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> <strong>How Time Moves Faster.</strong> There is an old saying that “a watched kettle never boils.” It is true that when we are watching time, when we are conscious of it, when we are waiting for something to happen, then it seems to pass ever so slowly. However, if we are busy, if we are interested in and preoccupied with what we are doing, then it really appears that “time flies.” Moreover, with older people time seems to pass much more quickly than with young children. Why is this? One year added to the life of a one-year-old means a 100-percent increase in life’s experiences. One year added to the life of a 50-year-old means just 2 percent more. To the child, a year seems a long, long time. The older person, if busy and in good health, finds that the years seem to fly faster and faster. He comes to a deeper understanding of Solomon’s words: “There is nothing new under the sun.” On the other hand, young people still have the seemingly slower, formative years with them. Instead of “striving after wind” with a materialistic world, they may use these years profitably in piling up a wealth of godly experience. Timely are Solomon’s further words: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come, or the years have arrived when you will say: ‘I have no delight in them.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:9-21:1:9" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:14-21:1:14" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> 12:1</a>.</p>

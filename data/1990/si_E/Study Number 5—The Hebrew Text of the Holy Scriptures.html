<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">How the Hebrew Scriptures, as part of the inspired Word of God, were copied, preserved as to textual integrity, and transmitted down to this day.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"> 1. (a) How do the ‘words of Jehovah’ differ from other treasures of the past? (b) What questions arise as to the preservation of God’s Word?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE ‘words of Jehovah’ captured in writing may be likened to waters of truth collected in a remarkable reservoir of inspired documents. How grateful we can be that throughout the period of these heavenly communications, Jehovah caused these “waters” to be gathered together in order to become an inexhaustible source of life-giving information! Other treasures of the past, such as regal crowns, heirlooms, and monuments of men, have tarnished, eroded, or collapsed with the passage of time, but the treasurelike sayings of our God will last to time indefinite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:8-23:40:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 40:8</a>) However, questions arise as to whether there has been contamination of these waters of truth after they were taken into the reservoir. Have they remained unadulterated? Have they been transmitted faithfully from the original-language texts, with the result that what is available to peoples of every language on earth today is reliable? We will find it a thrilling study to examine the section of this reservoir known as the Hebrew text, noting the care taken to preserve its accuracy, together with the wonderful provisions made for its transmission and availability to all nations of mankind through versions and new translations.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 2. How were the inspired writings preserved down to Ezra’s day?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The original documents in the Hebrew and Aramaic languages were recorded by God’s human secretaries, from Moses in 1513 B.C.E. down to shortly after 443 B.C.E. As far as is known today, none of these original writings are now in existence. However, from the beginning, great care was exercised in preserving the inspired writings, including authorized copies of them. About 642 B.C.E., in King Josiah’s time, “the very book of the law” of Moses, doubtless the original copy, was found stored away in the house of Jehovah. It had by this time been faithfully preserved for 871 years. Bible writer Jeremiah manifested such great interest in this discovery that he made written record of it at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:22:8-12:22:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 22:8-10</a>, and about the year 460 B.C.E., Ezra again referred to the same incident. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:14-14:34:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:14-18</a>) He was interested in these things, for “he was a skilled copyist in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:6-15:7:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6</a>) No doubt Ezra had access to other scrolls of the Hebrew Scriptures that had been prepared up to his time, possibly including originals of some of the inspired writings. Indeed, Ezra seems to have been the custodian of the divine writings in his day.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:1-16:8:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>ERA OF MANUSCRIPT COPYING</strong></p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 3. What need arose for additional copies of the Scriptures, and how was this filled?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> From Ezra’s time forward, there was an increased demand for copies of the Hebrew Scriptures. Not all the Jews returned to Jerusalem and <span id="page306" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="306" data-before-text="306"></span>Palestine in the restoration of 537 B.C.E. and thereafter. Instead, thousands remained in Babylon, while others migrated for business and other reasons, with the result that they were to be found in most of the large commercial centers of the ancient world. Many Jews would make annual pilgrimages back to Jerusalem for the various temple festivals, and there they would share in the worship conducted in Biblical Hebrew. In Ezra’s time the Jews in these many faraway lands used local assembly places known as synagogues, where readings and discussions of the Hebrew Scriptures took place.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Because of the many scattered places of worship, copyists had to multiply the supply of handwritten manuscripts.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu"> 4. (a) What was a genizah, and how was it used? (b) What valuable find was made in one of these in the 19th century?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> These synagogues usually had a storage room known as the genizah. In the course of time, the Jews placed in the genizah discarded manuscripts that had become torn or worn with age, replacing them with new ones for current synagogue use. From time to time, the contents of the genizah would be solemnly buried in the earth, in order that the text​—containing the holy name of Jehovah—​might not be desecrated. Over the centuries, thousands of old Hebrew Bible manuscripts disappeared from use in this way. However, the well-stocked genizah of the synagogue in Old Cairo was spared this treatment, probably because it was walled up and forgotten until the middle of the 19th century. In 1890, when the synagogue was being repaired, the contents of the genizah were reexamined and its treasures were gradually either sold or donated. From this source, fairly complete manuscripts and thousands of fragments (some said to be of the sixth century C.E.) have found their way to Cambridge University Library and other libraries of Europe and America.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu"> 5. (a) What ancient Hebrew manuscripts have now been cataloged, and how old are they? (b) What does a study of them reveal?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Today, in various libraries of the world, there have been counted and cataloged perhaps 6,000 manuscripts of all or portions of the Hebrew Scriptures. Until recently there were no such manuscripts (except for a few fragments) older than the tenth century C.E. Then, in 1947, in the area of the Dead Sea, there was discovered a scroll of the book of Isaiah, and in subsequent years additional priceless scrolls of the Hebrew Scriptures came to light as caves in the Dead Sea area surrendered rich treasures of manuscripts that had been hidden for nearly 1,900 years. Experts have now dated some of these as having been copied in the last few centuries B.C.E. The comparative study of the approximately 6,000 manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures gives a sound basis for establishing the Hebrew text and reveals faithfulness in the transmission of the text.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>THE HEBREW LANGUAGE</strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 6. (a) What was the early history of the Hebrew language? (b) Why was Moses qualified to write Genesis?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What men today call the Hebrew language was, in its original form, the language that Adam spoke in the garden of Eden. For this reason it could be referred to as man’s language. It was the language spoken in Noah’s day, though with a growing vocabulary. In still further expanded form, it was the basic language that survived when Jehovah confused mankind’s speech at the Tower of Babel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:7-1:11:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7-9</a>) Hebrew belongs to the Semitic group of languages, of which it is the family head. It appears to be related to the language of Canaan in Abraham’s time, and from their Hebraic branch, the Canaanites formed various dialects. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:19:18-23:19:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 19:18</a> it is referred to as “the language of Canaan.” Moses in his time was a scholar, learned not only in the wisdom of the Egyptians but also in the Hebrew language of his forefathers. For this reason he was in a position to read ancient documents that came into his hands, and these may have provided a basis for some of the information he recorded in what is now known as the Bible book of Genesis.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 7. (a) What later development of Hebrew took place? (b) As what did Biblical Hebrew serve?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Later, in the days of the Jewish kings, Hebrew came to be known as “the Jews’ language.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:26-12:18:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:28-12:18:28" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 28</a>) In Jesus’ time, the Jews spoke a newer or expanded form of Hebrew, and this still later became a rabbinic Hebrew. However, it should be noted that in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the language is still referred to as the “Hebrew” language, not the Aramaic. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:2-43:5:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:13-43:19:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:17-43:19:17" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:2-44:22:2" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Acts 22:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:11-66:9:11" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Rev. 9:11</a>) From earliest times, Biblical Hebrew was the binding language of communication, understood by most of Jehovah’s pre-Christian witnesses as well as by the Christian witnesses of the first century.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 8. Having in mind the purpose of the Scriptures, for what can we be truly thankful?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> The Hebrew Scriptures served as a reservoir of crystal-clear waters of truth, communicated and collected under divine inspiration. However, <span id="page307" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="307" data-before-text="307"></span>only those able to read Hebrew could avail themselves directly of these divinely provided waters. How could men of the multitongued nations also find a way to imbibe these waters of truth, thus gaining divine guidance and refreshment for their soul? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>) The only way was by translation from the Hebrew into other languages, thus broadening the flow of the stream of divine truth to all the multitudes of mankind. We can be truly thankful to Jehovah God that from about the fourth or third century B.C.E. down to the present time, portions of the Bible have been translated into more than 1,900 languages. What a boon this has proved to be for all righteously inclined people, who have indeed been enabled to find their “delight” in these precious waters!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:3-19:37:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 37:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Does the Bible itself give authority or justification for translating its text into other languages? Certainly it does! God’s word to Israel, “Be glad, you nations, with his people,” and Jesus’ prophetic command to Christians, “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations,” must be fulfilled. For this to take place, translation of the Scriptures is a necessity. Looking back over nearly 24 centuries of Bible translating, it is clear that Jehovah’s blessing has accompanied this work. Moreover, ancient translations of the Bible that have survived in manuscript form have also served to confirm the high degree of textual faithfulness of the Hebrew reservoir of truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:43-5:32:43" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 32:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> <strong>The Samaritan Pentateuch.</strong> Dating from early times, there is the version known as the Samaritan Pentateuch, which, as the name implies, contains only the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures. It is really a transliteration of the Hebrew text into Samaritan script, developed from the ancient Hebrew script. It provides a useful pointer to the Hebrew text of the time. This transliteration was made by the Samaritans​—descendants of those left in Samaria following the conquest of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel in 740 B.C.E. and those brought in by the Assyrians at that time. The Samaritans incorporated the worship of Israel with that of their own pagan gods, and they accepted the Pentateuch. It is thought that they made their transcription of it about the fourth century B.C.E., although some scholars suggest that it may have been as late as the second century B.C.E. As they read its text, they would, in fact, be pronouncing Hebrew. Although the text contains about 6,000 variations from the Hebrew text, many of them are minor details. Few of the existing manuscript copies are older than the 13th century C.E.

They likely assumed their present final form no earlier than about the fifth century C.E. Though they are only loose paraphrases of the Hebrew text, and not an accurate translation, they supply a rich background to the text and give aid in determining some difficult passages.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> <strong>The Greek <em>Septuagint.</em></strong> The most important of the early versions of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the first actual written translation from the Hebrew, is the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> (meaning, “Seventy”). Its translation began about 280 B.C.E., according to tradition, by 72 Jewish scholars of Alexandria, Egypt. Later, the number 70 somehow came to be used, and thus the version was called the <em>Septuagint.</em> Evidently it was completed sometime in the second century B.C.E. It served as Scripture for the Greek-speaking Jews and was used extensively down to the time of Jesus and his apostles. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, most of the 320 direct quotations and the combined total of perhaps 890 quotations and references to the Hebrew Scriptures are based on the <em>Septuagint.</em></p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">13. What valuable fragments of the <em>Septuagint</em> have survived to this day, and of what value are they?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> There are still available for study today a considerable number of fragments of the <em>Septuagint</em> written on papyrus. They are valuable because they belong to early Christian times, and though often just a few verses or chapters, they help in assessing the text of the <em>Septuagint.</em> The <span id="page310" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="310" data-before-text="310"></span>Fouad Papyri collection (Inventory No. 266) was discovered in Egypt in 1939 and has been found to be of the first century B.C.E. It contains portions of the books of Genesis and Deuteronomy. In the fragments of Genesis, the divine name does not occur because of the incomplete preservation. However, in the book of Deuteronomy, it occurs in various places, written in square Hebrew characters within the Greek text.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Other papyri date down to about the fourth century C.E., when the more durable vellum, a fine grade of parchment generally made from calf, lamb, or goat skins, began to be used for writing manuscripts.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> It is of interest that the divine name, in the form of the Tetragrammaton, also appears in the <em>Septuagint</em> of Origen’s six-column <em>Hexapla,</em> completed about 245 C.E. Commenting on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:2-19:2:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 2:2</a>, Origen wrote of the <em>Septuagint:</em> “In the most accurate manuscripts THE NAME occurs in Hebrew characters, yet not in today’s Hebrew [characters], but in the most ancient ones.”<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> The evidence appears conclusive that the <em>Septuagint</em> was tampered with at an early date, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) and <em>The·osʹ</em> (God) being substituted for the Tetragrammaton.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> There are hundreds of vellum and leather manuscripts of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> still in existence. A number of these, produced between the fourth century C.E. and the ninth century C.E., are important because of the large sections of the Hebrew Scriptures that they cover. They are known as uncials because they are written entirely in large, separated capital letters. The remainder are called minuscules because they are written in a smaller, cursive style of handwriting. Minuscule, or cursive, manuscripts remained in vogue from the ninth century until the inception of printing. The outstanding uncial manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, namely, the Vatican No. 1209, the Sinaitic, and the Alexandrine, all contain the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> with some slight variations.

How did the <em>Vulgate</em> originate? The Latin word <em>vulgatus</em> means “common, that which is popular.” When the <em>Vulgate</em> was first produced, it was in the common, or popular, Latin of the day so that it could be easily understood by the ordinary people of the Western Roman Empire. The scholar Jerome, who made this translation, had previously made two revisions of the Old Latin Psalms, in comparison with the Greek <em>Septuagint.</em> However, his translation of the Vulgate Bible was made direct from the original Hebrew and Greek languages and was thus not a version of a version. Jerome worked on his Latin translation from the Hebrew from about 390 C.E. to 405 C.E. While the completed work included Apocryphal books, that were by this time in the copies of the <em>Septuagint,</em> Jerome clearly distinguished between the books that were canonical and those that were not. The <em>New World Translation</em> refers many times to Jerome’s <em>Vulgate</em> in its footnotes.<span data-fnid="7" class="fn">g<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="7"></span></span></p>

Originally, the reader had to supply the vowel sounds from his knowledge of the language. Hebrew writing was like an abbreviated script. Even in modern English there are many standard abbreviations that people use in which only consonants appear. For example, there is <em>ltd.</em> as an abbreviation for <em>limited.</em> Similarly, the Hebrew language comprised a series of words made up only of consonants. Thus, by “consonantal text” is meant the Hebrew text without any vowel markings. The consonantal text of the Hebrew manuscripts became fixed in form between the first and second centuries C.E., although manuscripts with variant texts continued to circulate for some time. Alterations were no longer made, unlike the previous period of the Sopherim.</p>

These served as a written aid in the reading and pronouncing of vowel sounds, whereas previously the pronunciation had been handed down by oral tradition. The Masoretes made no changes whatsoever in the texts that they transmitted but recorded marginal notes in the Masora as they saw fit. They exercised great care to take no textual liberties. Additionally, in their Masora, they drew attention to textual peculiarities and gave corrected readings they considered necessary.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">21. What is the Masoretic text?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Three schools of Masoretes were engaged in the development of the vocalizing and accent marking of the consonantal text, namely, the Babylonian, Palestinian, and Tiberian. The Hebrew text now presented in printed editions of the Hebrew Bible is known as the Masoretic text and uses the system devised by the Tiberian school. This system was developed by the Masoretes of Tiberias, a city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Footnotes in the <em>New World Translation</em> refer many times to the Masoretic text (under the symbol M) and to its marginal notes, the Masora (under the symbol M<sup>margin</sup>).<span data-fnid="11" class="fn">k<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="11"></span></span></p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">22. What manuscript of the Babylonian line of texts has become available, and how does it compare with the Tiberian text?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The Palestinian school placed the vowel signs above the consonants. Only a small number of such manuscripts came down to us, showing that this system of vocalization was imperfect. The Babylonian system of vowel pointing was likewise supralinear. A manuscript exhibiting the Babylonian pointing is the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets, of 916 C.E., preserved in the Leningrad Public Library, U.S.S.R. This codex contains Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the “minor” prophets, with marginal notes (Masora). Scholars have eagerly examined this manuscript and compared it with the Tiberian text. Although it uses the supralinear system of vocalization, it in fact follows the Tiberian text as regards the consonantal text and its vowels and Masora. The British Museum has a copy of the Babylonian text of the Pentateuch, which has been found to be substantially in agreement with the Tiberian text.</p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">23. What series of Hebrew manuscript finds has been made near the Dead Sea?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> <strong>Dead Sea Scrolls.</strong> In 1947 an exciting new chapter in Hebrew manuscript history began. In a cave at Wadi Qumran (Nahal Qumeran), in the area of the Dead Sea, the first Isaiah scroll, together with other Biblical and non-Biblical scrolls, was discovered. Shortly thereafter, a complete photostatic copy of this well-preserved Isaiah scroll (1QIs<sup>a</sup>) was published for scholars to study. It is believed to date toward the end of the second century B.C.E. Here, indeed, was an <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>incredible find​—a Hebrew manuscript about a thousand years older than the oldest existing manuscript of the recognized Masoretic text of Isaiah!<span data-fnid="12" class="fn">l<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="12"></span></span> Other caves in Qumran surrendered fragments of over 170 scrolls representing parts of all books of the Hebrew Scriptures except Esther. Studies of such scrolls are still in progress.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">24. How do these manuscripts compare with the Masoretic text, and what use does the <em>New World Translation</em> make of them?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> One scholar reports that his investigation of the lengthy <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> in one important Dead Sea Scroll of the Psalms (11QPs<sup>a</sup>) shows it to be in almost complete verbal agreement with the Masoretic text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a>. Regarding the Psalms Scroll, Professor J. A. Sanders noted: “Most of [the variants] are orthographic and important only to those scholars who are interested in clues to the pronunciation of Hebrew in antiquity, and such matters.”<span data-fnid="13" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="13"></span></span> Other examples of these remarkable ancient manuscripts indicate no great variations in most cases. The Isaiah scroll itself, though it shows some differences in spelling and in grammatical construction, does not vary as to doctrinal points. This published Isaiah scroll was examined as to its variations in the preparation of the <em>New World Translation,</em> and references are made to it.<span data-fnid="14" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="14"></span></span></p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> The major lines of transmission of the Hebrew Scriptures have now been discussed. Principally, these are the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aramaic Targums, the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> the Tiberian Hebrew text, the Palestinian Hebrew text, the Babylonian Hebrew text, and the Hebrew text of the Dead Sea Scrolls. As a result of study and comparison of these texts, we are assured that the Hebrew Scriptures have come down to us today substantially in the form in which inspired servants of God first recorded them.</p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">26. (a) When was a critical study of the Hebrew text advanced, and what are some master texts that have been printed? (b) How has the Ginsburg text been used?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> The standard printed edition of the Hebrew Bible right into the 19th century was the Second Rabbinic Bible of Jacob ben Chayyim published in 1524-25. It was not until the 18th century that scholars began to advance the critical study of the Hebrew text. In 1776-80, at Oxford, Benjamin Kennicott published variant readings from over 600 Hebrew manuscripts. Then, in 1784-98, at Parma, the Italian scholar J. B. de Rossi published variant readings of over 800 more manuscripts. Hebrew scholar S. Baer, of Germany, also produced a master text. In more recent times, C. D. Ginsburg devoted many years to producing a critical master text of the Hebrew Bible. This first appeared in 1894, with a final revision in 1926.<span data-fnid="15" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="15"></span></span> Joseph Rotherham used the 1894 edition of this text in producing his English translation, <em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> in 1902, and Professor Max L.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> In 1906 Hebrew scholar Rudolf Kittel released in Germany the first edition (and later, a second edition) of his refined Hebrew text entitled <em>Biblia Hebraica,</em> or “The Hebrew Bible.” In this book Kittel provided a textual apparatus through extended footnotes, which collated or compared the many Hebrew manuscripts of the Masoretic text available at that time. He used the generally accepted text by Jacob ben Chayyim as the basic text. When the far older, superior Ben Asher Masoretic texts, which had been standardized about the 10th century C.E., became available, Kittel set out to produce an entirely different third edition of the <em>Biblia Hebraica.</em> This work was completed by his associates after his death.</p>

A new edition of the Hebrew text, namely <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia,</em> dated 1977, was used for updating the information presented in the footnotes of the <em>New World Translation</em> published in 1984.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE year 617 B.C.E., Jehoiachin, king of Judah, surrendered Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar, who took the foremost people of the land and the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house to Babylon. Among the captives were the king’s family and the princes; the valiant, mighty men; the craftsmen and builders; and Ezekiel the son of Buzi the priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:11-12:24:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ezek. 1:1-3</a>) With heavy hearts, these exiled Israelites had completed their weary journey from a land of hills, springs, and valleys to one of vast level plains. Now they lived by the river Chebar in the midst of a mighty empire, surrounded by a people of strange customs and of pagan worship. Nebuchadnezzar permitted the Israelites to have their own houses, keep servants, and engage in business. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:1-26:8:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:5-24:29:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer. 29:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:65-15:2:65" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ezra 2:65</a>) If industrious, they could become prosperous. Would they fall into the traps of Babylonian religion and materialism? Would they continue to rebel against <span id="page133" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span>Jehovah? Would they accept their exile as discipline from him? They would meet new tests in the land of their exile.</p>

(b) Significantly, how is Ezekiel addressed, and what does his name mean? (c) During what years did Ezekiel prophesy, and what is known of his life and his death?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> During these critical years leading down to the destruction of Jerusalem, Jehovah did not deprive himself or the Israelites of the services of a prophet. Jeremiah was stationed in Jerusalem itself, Daniel was in the court of Babylon, and Ezekiel was the prophet to the Jewish exiles in Babylonia. Ezekiel was both priest and prophet, a distinction likewise enjoyed by Jeremiah and later by Zechariah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:3-26:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:3</a>) Throughout his book he is addressed over 90 times as “son of man,” a point of significance when studying his prophecy because, in the Christian Greek Scriptures, Jesus is similarly referred to as “Son of man” nearly 80 times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:2:1-26:2:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matt. 8:20</a>) His name Ezekiel (Hebrew, <em>Yechez·qeʼlʹ</em>) means “God Strengthens.” It was in the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 613 B.C.E., that Ezekiel was commissioned by Jehovah as prophet. We read of him still at his work in the 27th year of the exile, 22 years later. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:17-26:29:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 29:17</a>) He was married, but his wife died on the day that Nebuchadnezzar began his final siege of Jerusalem.

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 4. What dramatic fulfillments have Ezekiel’s prophecies seen?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Further proof of authenticity is to be found in the dramatic fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecies against neighboring nations, such as Tyre, Egypt, and Edom. For example, Ezekiel prophesied that Tyre would be devastated, and this was partly fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar took the city after a siege of 13 years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:2-26:26:21" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:2-21</a>) This conflict did not mean the complete end for Tyre. However, Jehovah’s judgment was that it should be <em>totally</em> destroyed. He had foretold through Ezekiel: “I will scrape her dust away from her and make her a shining, bare surface of a crag. . . . Your stones and your woodwork and your dust they will place in the very midst of the water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:4-26:26:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">26:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:12-26:26:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12</a>) This was all fulfilled more than 250 years later when Alexander the Great moved against the island city of Tyre. Alexander’s soldiers scraped up all the debris of the ruined mainland city and threw it into the sea, making a half-mile <strong>[800 m]</strong> causeway out to the island city. Then, with an intricate siegework, they scaled the 150-foot-high <strong>[46 m]</strong> walls to take the city in 332 B.C.E. Thousands were killed, and many more were sold into slavery. As Ezekiel had also predicted, Tyre became the ‘bare surface of a crag and a drying yard for dragnets.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:14-26:26:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">26:14</a>)<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> On the other side of the Promised Land, the treacherous Edomites were also annihilated, in fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:25:12-26:25:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">25:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:35:2-26:35:9" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 35:2-9</a>)<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> And, of course, Ezekiel’s prophecies about the destruction of Jerusalem and Israel’s restoration also proved to be accurate.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:12-26:17:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">17:12-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:7-26:36:14" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 36:7-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 5. How did the Jews react to Ezekiel’s early prophecies?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> In the early years of his prophetic career, Ezekiel proclaimed God’s certain judgments against unfaithful Jerusalem and warned the exiles against idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:1-26:14:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">14:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:12-26:17:21" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 17:12-21</a>) The captive Jews were showing no real signs of repentance. Their responsible men made a practice of consulting Ezekiel, but they paid no attention to the messages from Jehovah that Ezekiel conveyed to them. They went right ahead with their idolatry and materialistic practices. The loss of their temple, their holy city, and their dynasty of kings came as a terrific shock, but it awakened only a few to humility and repentance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:9" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 137:1-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> 6. What do Ezekiel’s later prophecies emphasize, and how is the sanctification of Jehovah’s name highlighted?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Ezekiel’s prophecies in the later years emphasized the hope of restoration. They also took Judah’s neighbor nations to task for exulting over her downfall. Their own humiliation, together with Israel’s restoration, would sanctify Jehovah before their eyes. In summary, the purpose of the captivity and of the restoration was: ‘You people, both of the Jews and of the nations, will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:7-26:39:7" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezek. 39:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:22-26:39:22" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 22</a>) This sanctification of Jehovah’s name is highlighted throughout the book, there being more than 60 occurrences of the expression: “You [or, they] will have to know that I am Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:6:7-26:6:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">6:7</a>, footnote.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The book falls naturally into three sections. The first, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:24:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">chapters 1 to 24</a>, contains warnings of the certain destruction of Jerusalem. The second section, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:25:1-26:32:32" data-bid="30-1" class="b">chapters 25 to 32</a>, contains prophecies of doom to several pagan nations. The last section, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:1-26:48:35" data-bid="31-1" class="b">chapters 33 to 48</a>, consists of prophecies of the restoration, culminating in the vision of a new temple and holy city. For the most part, the prophecies are arranged chronologically as well as topically.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 8. What does Ezekiel see in his initial vision?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> <strong>Jehovah commissions Ezekiel as watchman</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:3:27" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1:1–3:27</a>). In his initial vision, in 613 B.C.E., Ezekiel sees a violent wind from the north, together with a cloud mass and quivering fire. Out of it come four winged living creatures, with faces of a man, a lion, a bull, and an eagle. They have the appearance of burning coals, and each is accompanied, as it were, by a wheel in the midst of a wheel of fearful height, with rims full of eyes. They move in any direction in constant unity. Above the heads of the living creatures is the likeness of an expanse, and above the expanse is a throne on which is “the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 9. What is involved in Ezekiel’s commission?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Jehovah calls on the prostrate Ezekiel: “Son of man, stand up.” He then commissions him as prophet to Israel and to the rebellious nations round about. Whether they heed or not is beside the point. At least they will know that a prophet of the Lord Jehovah has been in their midst. Jehovah makes Ezekiel eat the roll of a book, which becomes like honey for sweetness in his mouth. He tells him: “Son of man, a watchman is what I have made you to the house of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:2:1-26:2:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:3:17-26:3:17" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 3:17</a>) Ezekiel must faithfully give the warning, or he will die.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">10. What sign to Israel does Ezekiel enact?</p>

Jehovah tells Ezekiel to engrave a sketch of Jerusalem on a brick. He must stage a mock siege against it as a sign to Israel. To impress the point, he is to lie before the brick 390 days on his left side and 40 days on his right side, while subsisting on a very meager diet. That Ezekiel actually acts out the scene is indicated by his plaintive appeal to Jehovah for a change of cooking fuel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:9-26:4:15" data-bid="36-1" class="b">4:9-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">11. (a) How does Ezekiel portray the calamitous end of the siege? (b) Why will there be no relief?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Jehovah has Ezekiel portray the calamitous end of the siege by shaving off his hair and his beard. A third of this he must burn, a third hack with a sword, and a third scatter to the wind. Thus, at the end of the siege, some of Jerusalem’s inhabitants will die by famine, pestilence, and the sword, and the rest will be scattered among the nations. Jehovah will make her a devastation. Why? Because of the offensiveness of her depraved and detestable idolatry. Wealth will buy no relief. In the day of Jehovah’s fury, the people of Jerusalem will throw their silver in the streets, “and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:27-26:7:27" data-bid="37-1" class="b">7:27</a>.</p>

It is now 612 B.C.E. In a vision Ezekiel is transported to faraway Jerusalem, where he sees the detestable things that are happening in Jehovah’s temple. In the courtyard, there is a disgusting symbol inciting Jehovah to jealousy. Boring through the wall, Ezekiel finds 70 of the elderly men worshiping before wall carvings of loathsome beasts and dungy idols. They excuse themselves by saying: “Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:12-26:8:12" data-bid="39-1" class="b">8:12</a>) At the north gate, women are weeping over the pagan god Tammuz. But that is not all!

Jehovah tells this man in linen to pass through the midst of the city and put a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning over the detestable things being done in its midst. Next, he tells the six men to move in and kill off everyone, “old man, young man and virgin and little child and women,” on whom there is no mark. This they do, starting with the old men before the house. The man in linen reports: “I have done just as you have commanded me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:6-26:9:6" data-bid="40-1" class="b">9:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:11-26:9:11" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

A cherub thrusts out fiery coals from between the wheelwork, and the man in linen takes them and scatters them over the city. As for the scattered ones of Israel, Jehovah promises to regather them and give them a new spirit. But what of these wicked false worshipers in Jerusalem? “Upon their head I shall certainly bring their own way,” says Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:21-26:11:21" data-bid="41-1" class="b">11:21</a>) The glory of Jehovah is seen ascending from over the city, and Ezekiel proceeds to tell the vision to the exiled people.</p>

Ezekiel becomes the actor in another symbolic scene. During the daytime, he brings out of his house his luggage for exile, and then at night he goes through a hole in the wall of the city with his face covered. He explains this to be a portent: “Into exile, into captivity they will go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:11-26:12:11" data-bid="43-1" class="b">12:11</a>) Those stupid prophets who walk after their own spirit!

The vine turns its branches toward another eagle (Egypt), but is it successful? It is torn out by the roots!

On that same day, Ezekiel’s wife dies, but in obedience to Jehovah, the prophet does not mourn. This is a sign that the people must not mourn at Jerusalem’s destruction, for it is a judgment from Jehovah, in order that they may know who he is.

On either side of the torrent, trees provide food and healing for the people. The vision then gives the inheritances of the 12 tribes, not overlooking the alien resident and the chieftain, and describes the holy city to the south, with its 12 gates named after the tribes.

Transcendent in glory and exquisite in beauty is the city that is called “Jehovah Himself Is There”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:16-26:38:16" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 38:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:35-26:48:35" data-bid="85-3" class="b"> 48:35</a>.</p>

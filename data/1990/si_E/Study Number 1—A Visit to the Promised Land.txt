Studies on the Inspired Scriptures and Their Background
Study Number 1​—A Visit to the Promised Land
The regions of the land, its physical features, its mountains and valleys, its rivers and lakes, and its climate, soil, and varieties of vegetation.
 1. (a) Why is the designation “Promised Land” most appropriate? (b) What glorious prospect may we have in mind as we examine the geography of the land?
THE boundaries of the ancient Promised Land were set by Jehovah God. (Ex. 23:31; Num. 34:1-12; Josh. 1:4) For many centuries this area was referred to by some as the land of Palestine, a name derived from the Latin Palaestina and the Greek Pa·lai·stiʹne. This latter word is drawn from the Hebrew Peleʹsheth. In the Hebrew Scriptures, Peleʹsheth is translated “Philistia,” and it has reference just to the territory of the Philistines, who were enemies of God’s people. (Ex. 15:14) However, since Jehovah promised this land to faithful Abraham and his descendants, the designation “Promised Land,” or “Land of Promise,” is most appropriate. (Gen. 15:18; Deut. 9:27, 28; Heb. 11:9) This land is remarkable in the variety of its geography, wrapping up in this small area many of the distinct features and extremes that are to be found throughout the earth. If Jehovah could give as an inheritance to his ancient witnesses such a land of promise with all its beauteous variety, then certainly he can yet give to his dedicated worshipers a glorious new world paradise extending earth wide, with mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes, to bring them delight. Let us now pay keen attention to the geographic features of the Land of Promise, as we visit on an imaginary tour.a
GENERAL SIZE
 2. In how much of the Promised Land did the Jews settle, and in what additional territory?
2 According to its God-given boundaries as stated at Numbers 34:1-12, the land promised to Israel was to be a thin strip of territory. It was to be about 300 miles [480 km] from north to south and about 35 miles [56 km] wide, on the average. It was not until the reigns of Kings David and Solomon that the entire area promised was occupied militarily, with the placing of many subject peoples under control. However, the portion actually settled by the Jews is generally described as that covering from Dan to Beer-sheba, which was a distance of about 150 miles [240 km] from north to south. (1 Ki. 4:25) The distance across the country from Mount Carmel to the Sea of Galilee is about 32 miles [51 km], and in the south where the Mediterranean shoreline curves gradually to the southwest, it is over 50 miles [80 km] from Gaza to the Dead Sea. This settled area west of the Jordan River contained only about 6,000 square miles [15,000 sq. km]. However, the Israelites additionally settled in lands to the east of the Jordan (lands not included in the original promised boundaries), to make the total of settled territory a little less than 10,000 square miles [26,000 sq. km].
NATURAL REGIONS
 3. Using the map “Natural Regions of the Promised Land” with the paragraph, briefly identify the areas included in the following natural divisions of the land: (a) the plains west of the Jordan, (b) the mountainous regions west of the Jordan, (c) the mountains and tablelands east of the Jordan.

A. SEACOAST OF THE GREAT SEA
 4. What are the characteristics and climate of the seacoast?
4 Beginning our visit from the west, we view first the seacoast stretching along the beautiful, blue Mediterranean. Because of large stretches of sand dunes, the only good natural harbor below Mount Carmel is at Joppa; but north of Carmel there are several good natural harbors. The Phoenicians, who lived in the country along this part of the coast, became a famous seafaring people. The average annual temperature along the sunny seacoast is a pleasant 67° F. [19° C.], though the summers are very hot, with an average daytime temperature of about 93° F. [34° C.] in Gaza.
B-1 PLAIN OF ASHER
 5, 6. Describe briefly (a) the Plain of Asher, (b) the coastal strip of Dor.
5 This coastal plain stretches north from Mount Carmel for about 25 miles [40 km]. Its greatest width is about eight miles [13 km], and it is part of the land that was assigned to the tribe of Asher. (Josh. 19:24-30) It was a fertile strip of plain and produced well, supplying food for Solomon’s royal table.​—Gen. 49:20; 1 Ki. 4:7, 16.
B-2 THE COASTAL STRIP OF DOR
6 This strip of land borders the Carmel Range for about 20 miles [32 km]. It is only about two and a half miles [4 km] wide. It actually amounts to a coastal strip of land lying between Carmel and the Mediterranean. In its southern part, there is the harbor city of Dor, and to the south of this, the sand dunes begin. The hills behind Dor produced choice food for Solomon’s banquets. One of Solomon’s daughters was married to the deputy from this region.​—1 Ki. 4:7, 11.
B-3 PASTURE GROUNDS OF SHARON
 7. (a) How is Sharon referred to in prophecy, and why? (b) In Hebrew times for what was this region used?
7 In view of the proverbial beauty of its flowers, it is appropriate that Sharon is mentioned in Isaiah’s prophetic vision of the restored land of Israel. (Isa. 35:2) This is a fertile, well-watered land. It is a plain that varies from 10 to 12 miles [16 to 19 km] in width, extending for about 40 miles [64 km] southward from the coastal strip of Dor. In Hebrew times oak forests grew in the northern part of Sharon. Many flocks grazed there after the grain was cut. It is for this reason that it was called the pasture grounds of Sharon. In King David’s time, the royal herds were kept in Sharon. (1 Chron. 27:29) Today extensive citrus groves are to be found in this area.
B-4 PLAIN OF PHILISTIA
 8. Where is the Plain of Philistia, and what are its features?
8 This section of land lies south of the pasture grounds of Sharon, extending some 50 miles [80 km] along the coast and about 15 miles [24 km] inland. (1 Ki. 4:21) The sand dunes along the shoreline penetrate sometimes as much as three and a half miles [6 km]. This is a rolling plain, which rises steppelike from 100 feet [30 m] to as much as 650 feet [200 m] behind Gaza in the south. The soil is rich; but rain is not very plentiful, and there is always the danger of drought.
B-5 CENTRAL EAST-WEST VALLEY
 9. (a) What two parts make up the central east-west valley, and of what practical value was it? (b) By using the diagrams of “Typical Cross Sections of the Promised Land,” describe the general topography of this area.
9 The central east-west valley is actually made up of two parts, the Valley Plain of Megiddo, or Esdraelon, to the west, and the Low Plain of Jezreel to the east. (2 Chron. 35:22; Judg. 6:33) This entire central valley offered easy cross-country travel from the Jordan rift valley to the Mediterranean Coast, and it became an important trade route. The Plain of Megiddo is drained by the torrent valley Kishon, which makes its way out through a narrow gap between Mount Carmel and the hills of Galilee into the Plain of Asher and from there to the Mediterranean. This modest watercourse all but dries up during the summer months, but at other times it wells up into a torrent.​—Judg. 5:21.
10. (a) Describe the Low Plain of Jezreel. (b) With what Biblical events is this area associated?
10 The Low Plain of Jezreel drains southeasterly toward the Jordan. This valley corridor, the Plain of Jezreel, is about 2 miles [3.2 km] wide and covers a distance of nearly 12 miles [19 km]. The elevation starts at over 300 feet [90 m], and then it drops down steadily to about 390 feet [120 m] below sea level near Beth-shean. The entire central valley is very fertile, the Jezreel section being one of the richest parts of the entire country. Jezreel itself means “God Will Sow Seed.” (Hos. 2:22) The Scriptures speak of the pleasantness and beauty of this district. (Gen. 49:15) Both Megiddo and Jezreel were strategic in the battles fought by Israel and surrounding nations, and it was here that Barak, Gideon, King Saul, and Jehu fought.​—Judg. 5:19-21; 7:12; 1 Sam. 29:1; 31:1, 7; 2 Ki. 9:27.
C-1 HILLS OF GALILEE
11, 12. (a) To what extent did Galilee feature in the ministry of Jesus, and who came from this district? (b) Contrast Lower Galilee with Upper Galilee.
11 It was in the southern section of the hills of Galilee (and around the Sea of Galilee) that Jesus did the greater part of his work of witnessing to Jehovah’s name and Kingdom. (Matt. 4:15-17; Mark 3:7) Most of Jesus’ followers, including all 11 of his faithful apostles, came from Galilee. (Acts 2:7) In this district, sometimes called Lower Galilee, the country is truly delightful, the hills rising no higher than 2,000 feet [600 m]. From autumn to spring, there is no lack of rain over this pleasant land, and hence it is not a desert region. In springtime every hillside is ablaze with flowers, and every valley basin is rich with grain. On the small plateaus, there is rich soil for farming, and the hills are well suited for the growing of olive trees and vines. Towns of Bible fame in this area are Nazareth, Cana, and Nain. (Matt. 2:22, 23; John 2:1; Luke 7:11) This area gave Jesus a rich background to draw on in framing his illustrations.​—Matt. 6:25-32; 9:37, 38.
12 In the northern section, or Upper Galilee, the hills rise to well over 3,600 feet [1,100 m], becoming, in effect, the foothills of the Lebanon Mountains. Upper Galilee is aloof and windswept, and rain is heavy. In Bible times the westward slopes were thickly forested. This region was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali.​—Josh. 20:7.
C-2 HILLS OF CARMEL
13. (a) What actually is Carmel? (b) What mention is made of it in the Bible?
13 The spur of Mount Carmel juts out majestically into the Mediterranean Sea. Carmel is actually a hilly range, about 30 miles [48 km] in length, that rises as high as 1,790 feet [545 m] above the sea. It extends from the hills of Samaria to the Mediterranean, and its headland, which forms the main ridge at the northwest end, is unforgettable in its grace and beauty. (Song of Sol. 7:5) The name Carmel means “Orchard,” which truly fits this fertile promontory, bedecked with its famous vineyards and fruit and olive trees. Isaiah 35:2 uses it as a symbol of the fruitful glory of the restored land of Israel: ‘The splendor of Carmel must be given it.’ It was here that Elijah challenged the priests of Baal and that “the fire of Jehovah came falling” in proof of His supremacy, and it was from the top of Carmel that Elijah called attention to the small cloud that became a great downpour, thus miraculously ending the drought on Israel.​—1 Ki. 18:17-46.
C-3 HILLS OF SAMARIA
14. Which tribes settled in the hills of Samaria, and for what crops is this area suitable?
14 The southern part of this region is the more hilly, rising to above 3,000 feet [900 m] in the east. (1 Sam. 1:1) In this region, there is a greater and more dependable rainfall than in Judah to the south. This region was settled by the descendants of Ephraim, Joseph’s younger son. The northern part of this region, which was allotted to the half tribe of Manasseh, the older son of Joseph, comprises valley basins and small plains surrounded by hills. The hilly land is not so fertile, though there are vineyards and olive groves, made possible by extensive terracing of the lower hillsides. (Jer. 31:5) However, the larger valley basins are excellent for grain growing and general farming. Many cities dotted this region in Bible times. During the time of the northern kingdom, Manasseh supplied the three successive capitals​—Shechem, Tirzah, and Samaria—​and the entire region came to be called Samaria, after the capital.​—1 Ki. 12:25; 15:33; 16:24.
15. (a) How was Moses’ blessing on Joseph fulfilled in the region of Samaria? (b) How was this land further blessed during Jesus’ time?
15 Moses’ blessing on Joseph was truly fulfilled toward this land. “As to Joseph he said: ‘May his land be continually blessed from Jehovah with the choice things of heaven, with dew, . . . and with the choice things, the products of the sun, and with the choice things, the yield of the lunar months, and with the choicest from the mountains of the east, and with the choice things of the indefinitely lasting hills.’” (Deut. 33:13-15) Yes, this was delightful country. Its mountains were heavily forested, its valleys were productive, and it became filled with prosperous and well-populated cities. (1 Ki. 12:25; 2 Chron. 15:8) In later times Jesus preached in the land of Samaria, as did his disciples, and Christianity found many supporters there.​—John 4:4-10; Acts 1:8; 8:1, 14.
C-4 SHEPHELAH
16. (a) What characterizes the Shephelah? (b) Of what importance was this district in Bible times?
16 While the name Shephelah means “Lowland,” it is actually a hilly area reaching to an altitude of about 1,500 feet [450 m] in the southern portion and is cut by frequent valleys that run from east to west. (2 Chron. 26:10) It rises due east of the coastal plain of Philistia and is to be considered a lowland only by comparison with the higher hills of Judah farther to the east. (Josh. 12:8) Its hills, which were covered with sycamore trees, now support vineyards and olive groves. (1 Ki. 10:27) It had many cities. In Bible history it served as the buffer zone between Israel and the Philistines or whatever other invading armies tried to enter Judah from the direction of the coastal plain.​—2 Ki. 12:17; Obad. 19.
C-5 THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUDAH
17. (a) How productive was the hill country of Judah in Bible times, and how about today? (b) For what was Judah considered a good place?
17 This is a high rocky area about 50 miles [80 km] long and less than 20 miles [32 km] wide, with elevations varying from 2,000 to over 3,300 feet [600 to 1,000 km] above sea level. In Bible times the area was covered with timber growth, and especially on the western side, the hills and valleys were rich with grainfields, olive trees, and vineyards. This was a district that produced much good grain, oil, and wine for Israel. Particularly the area around Jerusalem has suffered much deforestation since Bible times and so appears barren in comparison with what it once was. In the winter, snow sometimes falls on the higher elevations in the center, such as at Bethlehem. In ancient times Judah was considered a good place for cities and fortresses, and in troublesome times the people could flee to these mountains for safety.​—2 Chron. 27:4.
18. (a) When did Jerusalem become the capital of Israel and Judah? (b) What are some interesting features of the city?
18 Outstanding in the history of Judah and of Israel is Jerusalem, also called Zion, after the name of its citadel. (Ps. 48:1, 2) Originally it was the Canaanite city of Jebus, lying on high ground above the junction of the Valley of Hinnom and the Kidron Valley. After David captured it and made it the capital, it was extended to the northwest, and eventually it covered also the Tyropoeon Valley. In time the Valley of Hinnom came to be called Gehenna. Because the Jews made idolatrous sacrifices there, it was declared unclean and was turned into a dump for rubbish and the dead bodies of vile criminals. (2 Ki. 23:10; Jer. 7:31-33) Thus, its fires became a symbol of total annihilation. (Matt. 10:28; Mark 9:47, 48) Jerusalem drew only a limited water supply from the Pool of Siloam, west of the Kidron Valley, and Hezekiah protected this by building an outer wall to contain it within the city.​—Isa. 22:11; 2 Chron. 32:2-5.
C-6 WILDERNESS OF JUDAH (JESHIMON)
19. (a) How does Jeshimon fit the meaning of its name? (b) What Bible events took place in this region?
19 Jeshimon is the Bible name for the Wilderness of Judah. It means “Desert.” (1 Sam. 23:19, footnote) How descriptive and fitting this name! The wilderness consists of the rugged eastern slopes of barren chalky formations of the Judean hills, which drop in elevation more than 3,000 feet [900 m] in 15 miles [24 km] as they approach the Dead Sea, where there is a wall of jagged cliffs. There are no cities and few settlements in Jeshimon. It was to this wilderness of Judah that David fled from King Saul, it was between this wilderness and the Jordan that John the Baptizer preached, and it was to this region that Jesus retired when fasting for 40 days.b​—1 Sam. 23:14; Matt. 3:1; Luke 4:1.
C-7 NEGEB
20. Describe the Negeb.
20 South of the hills of Judah lies the Negeb, where the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac resided for many years. (Gen. 13:1-3; 24:62) The Bible also refers to the southern part of this area as “the wilderness of Zin.” (Josh. 15:1) The semiarid Negeb stretches from the district of Beer-sheba in the north to Kadesh-barnea in the south. (Gen. 21:31; Num. 13:1-3, 26; 32:8) The land drops from the hills of Judah by a series of ridges, which run east and west, in such a way as to present a natural barrier against traffic or invasion from the south. The land falls away from the hills in the eastern part of the Negeb to a desert plain in the west, along the seacoast. Summer finds the land as barren as the desert, except near some of the torrent valleys. However, water may be obtained by sinking a well. (Gen. 21:30, 31) The modern State of Israel is irrigating and developing parts of the Negeb. “The river of Egypt” marked the southwestern boundary of the Negeb as well as being part of the southern boundary of the Promised Land.​—Gen. 15:18.
C-8 WILDERNESS OF PARAN
21. Where is Paran, and what part did it play in Bible history?
21 South of the Negeb and merging with the Wilderness of Zin lies the Wilderness of Paran. On leaving Sinai, the Israelites crossed this wilderness on their way to the Promised Land, and it was from Paran that Moses sent out the 12 spies.​—Num. 12:16–13:3.
D. THE GREAT ARABAH (THE RIFT VALLEY)
22. By using the map on page 272 and the diagrams on page 273, along with this paragraph, briefly describe the main features of the Arabah (Rift Valley) and their relationship to the surrounding territory.
22 One of the most unusual land formations on this earth is the great Rift Valley. In the Bible, the part that cuts through the Promised Land from north to south is called “the Arabah.” (Josh. 18:18) At 2 Samuel 2:29 this split in the earth’s crust is described as a gully. To its north is Mount Hermon. (Josh. 12:1) From the foot of Hermon, the Rift Valley drops rapidly southward to about 2,600 feet [800 m] below sea level at the bottom of the Dead Sea. From the southern end of the Dead Sea, the Arabah continues, rising to more than 650 feet [200 m] above sea level about midway between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of ʽAqaba. Thereafter it descends rapidly into the tepid waters of the eastern prong of the Red Sea. The accompanying section maps show the relation of the Rift Valley to the surrounding country.
D-1 HULA BASIN
23. With what was the Hula region associated in Bible times?
23 Beginning at the foot of Mount Hermon, the Rift Valley quickly falls more than 1,600 feet [490 m] to the Hula region, which is at about sea level. This district is well watered and remains beautifully green even through the hot summer months. It was in this area that the Danites settled in their city of Dan, which served as an idolatrous center of worship from the time of the judges into the time of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. (Judg. 18:29-31; 2 Ki. 10:29) It was at Caesarea Philippi, a town near the location of ancient Dan, that Jesus confirmed to his disciples that he was the Christ, and many believe that it was on nearby Mount Hermon that the transfiguration took place six days later. From Hula, the Rift Valley descends to the Sea of Galilee, which lies about 700 feet [210 m] below sea level.​—Matt. 16:13-20; 17:1-9.
D-2 REGION AROUND THE SEA OF GALILEE
24. (a) What other names is the Sea of Galilee called in the Bible? (b) What were its surroundings like in Jesus’ day?
24 The Sea of Galilee and its surroundings are delightful.c Interest in that region is heightened because of the many incidents in Jesus’ ministry that took place there. (Matt. 4:23) The sea is also called the Lake of Gennesaret, or Chinnereth, and the Sea of Tiberias. (Luke 5:1; Josh. 13:27; John 21:1) It is in reality a heart-shaped lake, almost 13 miles [21 km] long by about 7 miles [11 km] wide at its broadest point, and constitutes an important water reservoir for the whole land. It is closely shut in by hills on almost every side. The surface of the lake is about 700 feet [210 m] below sea level, resulting in pleasant, warm winters and very long, hot summers. In the days of Jesus, it was the center of a highly developed fishing industry, and the thriving cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, and Tiberias were located on or near the shore of the lake. The peacefulness of the lake can be quickly disturbed by storms. (Luke 8:23) The little plain of Gennesaret, triangular in shape, is located to the northwest of the lake. The soil is rich, producing almost every kind of crop known to the Promised Land. In the spring the gaily colored slopes glow with a brilliance that is nowhere surpassed in the land of Israel.d
D-3 DISTRICT OF THE JORDAN VALLEY (THE GHOR)
25. What are the main features of the Jordan Valley?
25 This entire gulleylike descending valley is also called “the Arabah.” (Deut. 3:17) The Arabs today refer to it as The Ghor, meaning “Depression.” The valley starts at the Sea of Galilee and is generally broad​—being about 12 miles [19 km] wide in places. The Jordan River itself lies about 150 feet [46 m] below the valley plain, turning and twisting in a course of 200 miles [320 km] to cover the 65 miles [105 km] to the Dead Sea.e Leaping over and down 27 cascading rapids, it falls about 590 feet [180 m] by the time it reaches the Dead Sea. The lower Jordan is fringed by a thicket of trees and shrubs, principally tamarisks, oleanders, and willows, among which lions and their cubs lurked in Bible times. This is today known as the Zor and is partly flooded in the spring. (Jer. 49:19) Rising above each side of this narrow junglelike strip is the Qattara, an inhospitable border of desolate land of little plateaus and dissected slopes leading up to the plains of The Ghor itself. The plains in the northern part of The Ghor, or Arabah, are well cultivated. Even in the southern part, toward the Dead Sea, the plateau of the Arabah, which is today very arid, at one time is said to have produced numerous kinds of dates, as well as many other tropical fruits. Jericho was and still is the most famous city in the Jordan Valley.​—Josh. 6:2, 20; Mark 10:46.
D-4 THE SALT (DEAD) SEA
26. (a) What are some of the remarkable facts about the Dead Sea? (b) What striking testimony does this region give concerning Jehovah’s judgments?
26 This is one of the most remarkable bodies of water on the face of the earth. It is fittingly called dead, for no fish live in the sea and there is little vegetation by its shore. The Bible calls it the Salt Sea, or the Sea of the Arabah, since it is located in the rift valley of the Arabah. (Gen. 14:3; Josh. 12:3) The sea is approximately 47 miles [75 km] from north to south and 9 miles [15 km] across. Its surface is about 1,300 feet [400 m] below that of the Mediterranean Sea, making it the lowest spot on earth. In its northern part, it has a depth of about 1,300 feet [400 m]. On each side, the sea is shut in by barren hills and steep cliffs. Although the Jordan River brings in fresh water, there is no water outlet except by evaporation, which is as fast as the water intake. The trapped water contains about 25 percent dissolved solid matter, mostly salt, and is poisonous to fish and painful to human eyes. Visitors to most of the area around the Dead Sea are often overwhelmed by a sense of desolation and destruction. It is a place of the dead. Though the entire region was once “a well-watered region . . . like the garden of Jehovah,” the area around the Dead Sea is now largely “a desolate waste” and has been such for close to 4,000 years, as striking testimony to the unchangeableness of Jehovah’s judgments that were executed there against Sodom and Gomorrah.​—Gen. 13:10; 19:27-29; Zeph. 2:9.
D-5 ARABAH (SOUTHWARD FROM THE SALT SEA)
27. What kind of territory makes up the southern Arabah, and who controlled this in ancient times?
27 This final section of the Rift Valley runs southward for another 100 miles [160 km]. This region is virtually all desert. Rain is rare, and the sun beats down without mercy. The Bible also calls this “the Arabah.” (Deut. 2:8) About midway, it reaches its highest point at more than 650 feet [200 m] above sea level and then descends southward again to the Gulf of ʽAqaba, the eastern prong of the Red Sea. It was here, at the port of Ezion-geber, that Solomon built a fleet of ships. (1 Ki. 9:26) For much of the period of the kings of Judah, this part of the Arabah was under the control of the kingdom of Edom.
E. MOUNTAINS AND TABLELANDS EAST OF THE JORDAN
28. Of what value have the lands of Bashan and Gilead been agriculturally, and how were these regions involved in Bible history?
28 “The side of the Jordan toward the east” rises rapidly from the Rift Valley to form a series of tablelands. (Josh. 18:7; 13:9-12; 20:8) To the north is the land of Bashan (E-1), which, together with half of Gilead, was given to the tribe of Manasseh. (Josh. 13:29-31) This was cattle country, a land for the farmers, a fertile plateau averaging about 2,000 feet [600 m] above sea level. (Ps. 22:12; Ezek. 39:18; Isa. 2:13; Zech. 11:2) In Jesus’ day this area exported much grain, and today it is agriculturally productive. Next, to the south, there lies the land of Gilead (E-2), the lower half of which was assigned to the tribe of Gad. (Josh. 13:24, 25) A mountainous region reaching to 3,300 feet [1,000 m], watered by good rains in the winter and heavy dews in the summer, it was also good livestock country and was specially renowned for its balsam. Today it is noted for its choice grapes. (Num. 32:1; Gen. 37:25; Jer. 46:11) It was to the land of Gilead that David fled from Absalom, and in the western part, Jesus preached in “the regions of Decapolis.”​—2 Sam. 17:26-29; Mark 7:31.
29. East of the Jordan, what lands lay to the south, and for what were they noted?
29 “The land of the sons of Ammon” (E-3) lies immediately south of Gilead, and half of this was given to the tribe of Gad. (Josh. 13:24, 25; Judg. 11:12-28) It is a rolling tableland, best suited to sheep grazing. (Ezek. 25:5) Still farther to the south is “the land of Moab.” (Deut. 1:5) The Moabites themselves were great sheepherders, and to this day sheep raising is the principal occupation of that area. (2 Ki. 3:4) Then, southeast of the Dead Sea, we come to the mountain plateau of Edom (E-4). The ruins of its great trading strongholds, such as Petra, remain to this day.​—Gen. 36:19-21; Obad. 1-4.
30. By what are the tablelands bounded on the east?
30 To the east of these hills and tablelands lies the extensive rocky wilderness that effectively cut off direct travel between the Promised Land and Mesopotamia, causing the caravan routes to detour many miles northward. To the south this wilderness meets up with the sand dunes of the great Arabian desert.
F. MOUNTAINS OF LEBANON
31. (a) What make up the mountains of Lebanon? (b) What features of Lebanon remain as they were in Bible times?
31 Dominating the landscape of the Promised Land are the mountains of Lebanon. There are really two ranges of mountains running parallel. The foothills of the Lebanon Range proper continue into Upper Galilee. In many places these hills reach right down to the seacoast. The highest peak in this range is about 10,000 feet [3,000 m] above sea level. The highest peak in the adjoining Anti-Lebanon Range is beautiful Mount Hermon, rising 9,232 feet [2,814 m] above sea level. Its melting snow provides a major source of water for the Jordan River and a source of dew during the dry period of late spring. (Ps. 133:3) The Lebanon Mountains were specially noted for their gigantic cedars, the wood of which featured in the construction of Solomon’s temple. (1 Ki. 5:6-10) While only a few groves of cedars remain today, the lower slopes still support vineyards, olive groves, and fruit orchards, just as they did in Bible times.​—Hos. 14:5-7.
32. How did Moses correctly describe the Land of Promise?
32 As we thus conclude our visit to Jehovah’s Land of Promise, sandwiched as it is between the forbidding wilderness to the east and the Great Sea, we can form a mental picture of the glory that once clothed it in the days of Israel. Truly, it was “a very, very good land . . . , flowing with milk and honey.” (Num. 14:7, 8; 13:23) Moses referred to it in these words: “Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of torrent valleys of water, springs and watery deeps issuing forth in the valley plain and in the mountainous region, a land of wheat and barley and vines and figs and pomegranates, a land of oil olives and honey, a land in which you will not eat bread with scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land the stones of which are iron and out of the mountains of which you will mine copper. When you have eaten and satisfied yourself, you must also bless Jehovah your God for the good land that he has given you.” (Deut. 8:7-10) May all who love Jehovah now likewise give thanks that he purposes to make the entire earth a glorious paradise, after the pattern of his ancient Land of Promise.​—Ps. 104:10-24.

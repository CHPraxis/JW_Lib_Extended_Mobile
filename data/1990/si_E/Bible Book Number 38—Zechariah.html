<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 1. What was the situation as to the temple in Jerusalem when Zechariah began to prophesy?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>AT A standstill! That was the state of the construction work on Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem when Zechariah began to prophesy. Whereas Solomon had built the original temple in 7 1/2 years (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:37-11:6:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:37, 38</a>), the repatriated Jews had been back in Jerusalem for 17 years and the building was yet far from completion. The work had finally stopped altogether following the ban by Artaxerxes (either Bardiya or Gaumata). But now, despite this official ban, the <span id="page169" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>work was once more getting under way. Jehovah was using Haggai and Zechariah to stir up the people to renew the construction and to stay with it until completed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:23-15:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:1-15:5:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 2. Why did the task look mountainous, but to what did Zechariah draw their attention?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The task before them looked mountainous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Zech. 4:6, 7</a>) They were few, the opposers many, and although they had a prince of the Davidic line, Zerubbabel, they had no king and were under foreign domination. How easy to sink into a weak, self-centered attitude, when the time really demanded strong faith and energetic action! Zechariah was used to draw their attention to God’s present purposes and even grander future purposes, thus strengthening them for the work to be done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:9-38:8:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">8:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:13-38:8:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13</a>) It was no time to be like their unappreciative forefathers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:5-38:1:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 3. (a) How is Zechariah identified, and why is his name appropriate? (b) When was Zechariah’s prophecy spoken and recorded?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Who was Zechariah? There are about 30 different persons mentioned in the Bible with the name Zechariah. However, the writer of the book that bears this name is identified as “Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Zech. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:1-15:5:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ezra 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:12-16:12:12" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Neh. 12:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:16-16:12:16" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 16</a>) His name (Hebrew, <em>Zekhar·yahʹ</em>) means “Jehovah Has Remembered.” The book of Zechariah makes it very plain that “Jehovah of armies” remembers His people, to deal well with them for His own name’s sake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:3-38:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Zech. 1:3</a>) The dates mentioned in the book give it a coverage of at least two years. It was in the “eighth month in the second year of Darius” (October/November 520 B.C.E.) that the temple building was resumed and Zechariah commenced prophesying. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:1:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1:1</a>) The book also makes a reference to “the fourth day of the ninth month, that is, Chislev,” in “the fourth year of Darius” (about December 1, 518 B.C.E.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:1-38:7:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">7:1</a>) Hence, Zechariah’s prophecy would no doubt be spoken and also recorded during the years 520-518 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:24-15:4:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4, 5. (a) Why did Zechariah predict Tyre’s fall long after the siege of that city by Nebuchadnezzar? (b) The fulfillment of what particular prophecies convincingly proves the book’s inspiration?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Students of the book of Zechariah will find ample proof of its authenticity. Take the case of Tyre. It was after a 13-year-long siege that the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar ruined Tyre. This, though, did not mean the complete end for Tyre. Zechariah, many years later, foretold the total destruction of Tyre. It was the island city of Tyre that Alexander the Great overthrew at the time of his famous causeway-building feat; he ruthlessly burned her, thus fulfilling Zechariah’s prophecy of some two centuries earlier.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:2-38:9:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Zech. 9:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The most convincing proof of the book’s divine inspiration, however, is to be found in the fulfillment of its prophecies concerning the Messiah, Christ Jesus, as can be seen by comparing <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:9</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:4-40:21:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 21:4, 5 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:14-43:12:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> John 12:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:10-38:12:10" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Zechariah 12:10</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:34-43:19:37" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 19:34-37</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:7-38:13:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Zechariah 13:7</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:31-40:26:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 26:31 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:27-41:14:27" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Mark 14:27</a>.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 6. (a) What accounts for the change of style from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:9:17" data-bid="73-1" class="b">chapter 9 of Zechariah</a> onward? (b) What may be the reason for Matthew’s referring to Zechariah as “Jeremiah”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> There are some Bible critics who say that the change in style of writing from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:9:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">chapter 9</a> onward indicates that that section could not have been written by Zechariah. The change in style, however, is certainly no greater than the change in subject matter would justify. Whereas the first eight <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:8:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b">chapters 1-8</a> deal with matters of more present importance to the people of Zechariah’s day, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:14:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b">chapters 9 to 14</a> the prophet looks forward into a more distant future. Some have queried why it is that Matthew quotes Zechariah but attributes his words to Jeremiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:9-40:27:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 27:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:12" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Zech. 11:12</a>) It appears that Jeremiah was at times reckoned as first of the Later Prophets (instead of Isaiah, as in our present Bibles); hence Matthew, in referring to Zechariah as “Jeremiah,” could have been following the Jewish practice of including a whole section of Scripture under the name of the first book of the section. Jesus himself used the designation “Psalms” to include all the books known as the Writings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

But Jehovah’s angel, who interviews them, <em>is</em> disturbed over Jerusalem’s condition.

He hears this word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by military force, nor by power, but by God’s spirit.’ A “great mountain” will be leveled before Zerubbabel, and the temple headstone will be brought forth to the cry: “How charming! How charming!” Zerubbabel has laid the temple foundations, and Zerubbabel will finish the work.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Zechariah is now assigned to shepherd the flock, which has been sold into slaughter by compassionless shepherds who say: “May Jehovah be blessed, while I shall gain riches.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:5-38:11:5" data-bid="52-1" class="b">11:5</a>) The prophet takes two staffs and names them “Pleasantness” and “Union.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:7-38:11:7" data-bid="53-1" class="b">11:7</a>) Breaking “Pleasantness,” he symbolizes a covenant broken. Then he calls for his wages, and they weigh him out 30 pieces of silver. Jehovah orders Zechariah to throw it into the treasury and, with superlative sarcasm, says, “the majestic value with which I have been valued.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:13-38:11:13" data-bid="54-1" class="b">11:13</a>) Now staff “Union” is cut up, breaking the brotherhood of Judah and Israel. A sword will come upon the false shepherds who have neglected Jehovah’s sheep.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21. (a) What is Jehovah’s judgment on those who fight against Jerusalem? (b) What scattering and refining are foretold?</p>

Another pronouncement begins. Jehovah will make Jerusalem a bowl that causes peoples to reel and a burdensome stone that scratches those lifting it. He will annihilate all nations that come against Jerusalem. Upon the house of David, Jehovah will pour out the spirit of favor and entreaties, and the people will look upon the one they pierced through, wailing over him “as in the wailing over an only son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:10-38:12:10" data-bid="56-1" class="b">12:10</a>) Jehovah of armies declares a cutting off of all idols and false prophets; the very parents of such a one must wound him so that in shame he removes his prophet’s garb. Jehovah’s associate shepherd is to be struck and the flock scattered, but Jehovah will refine a “third part” to call upon his name. Jehovah will say: “It is my people,” and it will answer: “Jehovah is my God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:9-38:13:9" data-bid="57-1" class="b">13:9</a>.</p>

There is a day coming, belonging to Jehovah.” All nations will attack Jerusalem, and half the city will go into exile, leaving behind a remnant. Then Jehovah will go forth and war against those nations, “as in the day of his warring, in the day of fight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:1-38:14:1" data-bid="58-1" class="b">14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:3-38:14:3" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 3</a>) The mountain of olive trees, on the east of Jerusalem, will split from east to west, making a valley for refuge. In that day living waters will flow east and west from Jerusalem, in summer and in winter, and “Jehovah must become king over all the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:9-38:14:9" data-bid="59-1" class="b">14:9</a>) While Jerusalem enjoys security, Jehovah will scourge those warring against her. As they stand, their flesh, eyes, and tongues will rot away. Confusion will hit them. The hand of each one will turn against his neighbor’s. Those left alive of all the nations will have to “go up from year to year to bow down to the King, Jehovah of armies.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:16-38:14:16" data-bid="60-1" class="b">14:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>WHY BENEFICIAL</strong></p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23. How is the record of Zechariah strengthening to faith?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> All who study and meditate on the prophecy of Zechariah will be benefited in gaining faith-strengthening knowledge. More than 50 times Zechariah draws attention to “Jehovah of armies” as the One who fights for and protects His people, filling them with power according to their need. When mountainlike opposition threatened the completion of the temple building, Zechariah declared: “This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘“Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,” Jehovah of armies has said. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a level land.’” The temple was completed with the help of Jehovah’s spirit. Likewise today, obstacles will melt if tackled with faith in Jehovah. It is just as Jesus told his disciples: “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘Transfer from here to there,’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:7" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Zech. 4:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:20-40:17:20" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Matt. 17:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">24. What illustration of loyalty is given in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:1-38:13:9" data-bid="74-1" class="b">chapter 13 of Zechariah</a>?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:2-38:13:6" data-bid="62-1" class="b">chapter 13, verses 2 to 6</a>, Zechariah illustrates the loyalty that to this day marks Jehovah’s organization. This must transcend every human relationship, such as that of close flesh-and-blood relatives. If a close relative should prophesy <span id="page172" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="172" data-before-text="172"></span>falsehood in the name of Jehovah, that is, speak contrary to the Kingdom message and try wrongly to influence others in the congregation of God’s people, the family members of that one must loyally support any judicial action taken by the congregation. The same position must be held with regard to any intimate associate who prophesies falsely, so that he may become ashamed and wounded at heart because of his wrong action.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">25. How does the prophecy of Zechariah link with other scriptures in identifying Messiah, the “Sprout,” and his office as High Priest and King under Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> As our introductory paragraphs showed, Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem as king, “humble, and riding upon an ass,” his betrayal for “thirty pieces of silver,” the scattering of his disciples at that time, and his being pierced on the stake by the soldier’s spear were all foretold by Zechariah in exact detail. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Zech. 9:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:12" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 11:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:7-38:13:7" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> 13:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:10-38:12:10" data-bid="63-4" class="b"> 12:10</a>) The prophecy also names the “Sprout” as the builder of the temple of Jehovah. A comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:1-23:11:10" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:5-24:23:5" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 23:5</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a> shows this one to be Jesus Christ, who “will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever.” Zechariah describes the “Sprout” as “a priest upon his throne,” which ties in with the apostle Paul’s words: “Jesus . . . has become a high priest according to the manner of Melchizedek forever,” also, “He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:12-38:6:13" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Zech. 6:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:20-58:6:20" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:1" data-bid="66-3" class="b"> 8:1</a>) Thus the prophecy points to the “Sprout” as High Priest and King at God’s right hand in the heavens, while at the same time it proclaims Jehovah as Sovereign Ruler over all: “And Jehovah must become king over all the earth. In that day Jehovah will prove to be one, and his name one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:9-38:14:9" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Zech. 14:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">26. To what glorious “day” does Zechariah repeatedly refer?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Referring to that time, the prophet repeats the phrase “in that day” some 20 times, and it even concludes his prophecy. An examination of its many occurrences shows it to be the day when Jehovah cuts off the names of the idols and removes the false prophets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:2-38:13:2" data-bid="68-1" class="b">13:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:4-38:13:4" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 4</a>) It is the day when Jehovah wars on the aggressor nations and spreads confusion in their ranks as he annihilates them and provides ‘the valley of his mountains’ as a refuge for his own people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:16-38:9:16" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Zech. 9:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:3:10-38:3:10" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:4-33:4:4" data-bid="70-3" class="b"> Mic. 4:4</a>) It is the glorious day when Jehovah of armies “will reside in the midst” of his people and when “living waters will go forth from Jerusalem.” These words of Zechariah identify events “in that day” as harbingers of “a new heaven and a new earth” of Kingdom promise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:11-38:2:11" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Zech. 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:8-38:14:8" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 14:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:3" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> Rev. 21:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:1" data-bid="71-4" class="b"> 22:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> “Who has despised the day of small things?” asks Jehovah. Look!

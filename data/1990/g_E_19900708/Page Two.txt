THE use of animals in medical research raises ethical and moral issues that stir the emotions of people in different ways. Scientists allege that much progress in medicine would have been impossible without the use of animals. One stated: “If we were not able to do research on animals, then we’d be dead in the water.”
ANIMAL activists lament the abuse of animal rights and the suffering and indignities inflicted on the millions of animals used in experimentation. They allege that there are now suitable alternatives to animals, such as computer models and tissue cultures, that scientists should use.
THERE are arguments for and against by both sides. We examine the issues in our opening series, considering first the scientific viewpoint on animal research.

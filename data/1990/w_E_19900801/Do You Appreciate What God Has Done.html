<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">WE OWE our lives to God. If he had not created humankind, we would never have been born. But God created more than life. He made us so that we could enjoy many things: the flavor of food, the warmth of sunlight, the sound of music, the freshness of a spring day, the tenderness of love. Even more, God gave us a mind and the desire to learn about him. He inspired the Bible, which gives us sound guidance, shows us how to live happier lives, and provides the hope of living forever in his righteous new world. God also provides his holy spirit, the support of a local congregation, and loving older men and women who can help us to remain strong in his service.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:17" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Hebrews 10:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> James 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:18-45:5:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Romans 5:18</a>) That son, Jesus Christ, said: “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) The salvation made possible by that ransom is of such superlative value that there is absolutely no way that anyone could do works to earn it, certainly not works formerly done under the Mosaic Law. Thus, Paul wrote: “A man is declared righteous, not due to works of law, but only through faith toward Christ Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:16-48:2:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:20-45:3:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 3:20-24</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Salvation comes by faith, but faith and appreciation for all that God has done should move us to action. It should motivate us to do things that show our faith. Jesus’ half brother James wrote: “Faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.” He further said: “Show me your faith apart from the works, and I shall show you my faith by my works.” James pointed out that even the demons “believe and shudder,” but obviously demons do not do godly works. Abraham, on the other hand, had both faith and works. “His faith worked along with his works and by his works his faith was perfected.” James repeated: “Faith without works is dead.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:17-59:2:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 2:17-26</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Peter pointed out that Christ’s “precious blood,” given in our behalf, is of such excelling value that our appreciation for it should be evident in our entire way of life. The apostle listed many things that our appreciation should prompt us to do. He counseled: “Put away all badness.” “Form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word.” “Declare abroad the excellencies of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” “Turn away from what is bad and do what is good.” “Make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you.” “Live the remainder of [your] time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:19-60:1:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:1-60:2:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:11-60:3:11" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 3:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:2-60:4:2" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> 4:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 7. In what situation might some people find themselves?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In some congregations you may find people who have attended the meetings for years. They love Jehovah’s organization, think his people are the finest people they have ever met, make fine comments about the truth, and defend the truth to outsiders. But something stands in their way, something holds them back. They have never taken the fine step that the 3,000 did on the day of Pentecost, that the believing Ethiopian asked about, or that Ananias urged Saul to take as soon as that former persecutor had realized that Jesus really was the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:36-44:8:36" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 8:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:16-44:22:16" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 22:16</a>) What is lacking in such ones today?

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What could stand in your way? The preceding article showed that some might find personal study to be a problem. God gave us wonderful minds, and he expects us to use them in serving him. Some people who had not even learned to read applied themselves to that task in order to learn more about God and his purposes. What about you? If you already know how to read, do you really study, as the Beroeans did, “carefully examining the Scriptures daily” to see if these things are so? Have you explored “the breadth and length and height and depth” of the truth? Have you dug deeply enough into God’s Word? Have you found out how exciting it really is? Have you developed a real desire to know God’s will? Do you have a genuine <em>hunger </em>for the truth?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:10-44:17:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 17:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:18-49:3:18" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ephesians 3:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Sometimes people hold back because of a real or imagined problem that they have had with someone in the congregation. Has someone seriously offended you? Then follow the guideline indicated by Jesus’ words: “Go lay bare his fault between you and him alone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15</a>) You may be surprised to find that the person did not even know that you were offended. But even if he does know, you may still ‘gain your brother,’ as Jesus said. You may also help him avoid stumbling someone else. Moreover, when you think about it, who are you really serving​—that person or God? Is your love for God so limited that you would let any imperfect human’s mistake interfere with your love for Him?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10, 11. What should you do if some secret sin has been holding you back?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>A secret sin may hold a person back from baptism. This could be something that happened in the past, or it might be a continuing wrong pattern. If this is a problem for you, is it not time to correct the matter? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:29-46:7:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:29-31</a>) Many of Jehovah’s people have had to make changes in their lives. The Bible says: “Repent, therefore, and turn around so as <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>to get your sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>No matter what you may have done in the past, you can repent, change, and ask for God’s forgiveness. “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire . . . Strip off the old personality, with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.” You can bring your life into harmony with his ways, enjoy a clean conscience, and have the hope of everlasting life in his righteous new world. Is that not worth whatever effort it may take?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:16-23:1:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Isaiah 1:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 6:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> Hebrews 9:14</a>.</p>

Do not such life-threatening habits show disrespect for God’s marvelous gift of life? If such habits stand in your way, surely it is time to correct them. Are these habits worth your life?

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Today’s world puts success and “the showy display of one’s means of life” ahead of almost everything else. But Jesus likened “the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches” to “thorns” that choke out the word of God. He also asked: “What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:2-41:4:8" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Mark 4:2-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:18-41:4:19" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:26-40:16:26" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Matthew 16:26</a>.</p>

Then he asked: “Of how much more worth are you than birds? . . . How much rather will [God] clothe you!” Wisely, Jesus told us to “quit being anxious” about material things. He said: “Seek continually [God’s] kingdom, and these things will be added to you.” He pointed out that we should put heavenly things first because ‘where our treasure is, there our heart would be also.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:22-42:12:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 12:22-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:20-40:6:21" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:20, 21</a>.</p>

If so, it is important to remember that first-century Christians had the same kind of feelings that we have today. God did not choose many wise and powerful ones, but he chose “the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:26-46:1:29" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>) Powerful religious leaders opposed these “ordinary” people and ordered them to stop preaching.

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc"><strong>‘What kind of “soil” am I?’</strong></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">  Jesus gave an illustration of a man who went out to sow seed. Some seed fell alongside the road and were eaten by birds. Others fell on rocky places without much soil. These sprouted, but when the sun came up, they withered and died. Still other seed fell among thorns and were choked. Jesus said that these three groups represented: first, the person who “hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it”; second, one who accepts the word but is turned away by the heat of “tribulation or persecution”; and third, the person for whom “the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word.”</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">  But Jesus also told of other seed that fell on fine soil. He said: “This is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:3-40:13:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 13:3-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:23" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 18-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">  It might be well to ask ourselves: ‘What kind of “soil” am I?’</p>

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc"><strong>They died for their faith</strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">  Do you know anyone who would rather die than violate his faith? Thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses have done that. In <em>The Nazi State and the New Religions: Five Case Studies in Non-Conformity, </em>Dr. Christine E. King wrote: “One out of every two German Witnesses was imprisoned, one in four lost their lives.”</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc">  When the horror of the camps finally ended in 1945, “the Witnesses’ numbers had increased and no compromises had been made.” In <em>The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, </em>J. S. Conway wrote of the Witnesses: “No other sect displayed anything like the same determination in the face of the full force of Gestapo terrorism.”</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">  Jehovah’s Witnesses were not persecuted because of politics or race. Rather, they suffered entirely because of their love of God and their refusal to violate their Bible-trained consciences.</p>

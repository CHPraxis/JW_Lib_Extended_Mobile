<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">UNDER this heading, the magazine <em>Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality </em>published an article in which Dr. Irene Jakab, a university professor of psychiatry, outlined what she felt is necessary if a child is to be raised to be a successful adult. Among the ingredients of her “prescriptions” was the need for parents to love their child, guide him as to what is right and wrong, and train him in making decisions. She felt that the “prescriptions” should definitely not include a quick temper on the part of the parents, perfectionism, overanxiety, or permissiveness.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dr. Jakab’s “prescriptions” are quite sound as far as they go. Indeed, thousands of years ago, the Bible gave similar counsel to parents. (See, for example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:1-20:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:24-20:13:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 22:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Colossians 3:21</a>.) However, the Bible includes something that Professor Jakab omitted: the vital importance of teaching children to love their Creator and be familiar with his Word. The apostle Paul wrote: “You, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 6:4-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Without such training, children may well grow up without a moral anchor. The result could be disastrous in this immoral and corrupt world.</p>

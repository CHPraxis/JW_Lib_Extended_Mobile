<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">‘Unless something is done soon, we can expect widespread economic decline and social turmoil’</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THAT was the message of Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group. His comments came in an annual “state-​of-​the-​world” report.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Earth’s environment, Brown said, continues to deteriorate. Unless the threats of ozone depletion, drought, deforestation, soil erosion, and population growth are brought under control, “economic decline may be inevitable.” He noted that world food production has dropped 14 percent per person since 1984 and that grain stocks are at their lowest levels in 15 years.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Brown also stated: “Time is not on our side. . . . We have to do it during the 1990’s. Beyond that it will be too late. . . . What will wake us up with a jolt is if we have another drought-​related harvest. Then we will find ourselves with no grain to export, and the doubling or tripling of grain prices. The economic shockwave will make the oil shortages look like a picnic.” He also observed: “It’s already too late for some of Africa. There’s no way to turn it around there. . . . Latin America will probably be next.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Such trends harmonize with Bible prophecies that speak of famine, disease, war, and death, with man “ruining the earth” in our time. Jesus foretold that this would culminate in a “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning.” That will mean the end of this present system of things, clearing the way for a new world of God’s making.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 6:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:10-61:3:13" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:10-13</a>.</p>

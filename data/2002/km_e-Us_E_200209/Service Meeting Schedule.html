(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:2-53:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:2</a>) To reach them with the truth about Jehovah, we should first try to determine what has influenced their thinking about God. Consider the four factors mentioned in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989226/48:465-49$p/E:1101989227/1-10"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 129-30</a>, that can hinder people from acquiring faith.

Invite the congregation to comment on key points learned and on how they were able to apply them personally or as family groups. (Portions can be assigned in advance.) Feature these program parts: (1) “Help New Ones to Cultivate Fear of God.” How can we assist interested ones who attended the Memorial to progress and become active servants of Jehovah? (2) “Fear of Jehovah Means the Hating of Bad.” (<em>w</em>87 4/15 16-18) How can <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> help us to turn away from things that Jehovah hates​—pride, lying, materialistic pursuits, unwholesome entertainment, misuse of the Internet? (3) “Draw Ever Closer to Those You Love.” We love Jehovah, Jesus, family members, others in the congregation; how does drawing close to them safeguard us from the world? (4) “Fear Jehovah, Not Men.” How has fear of displeasing Jehovah helped you to overcome timidity when preaching, to adhere to godly principles at work or school, or to resist pressure from your employer to miss meetings, assemblies, and conventions? (5) “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:37-19:119:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 119:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:13-58:4:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. 4:13</a>) Why should godly fear prevent us from drinking immoderately, viewing pornography, or practicing other concealed sins? (6) “Keep On Walking in the Fear of Jehovah.” How has Jehovah blessed you for making room for his spirit to operate fully in your life?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:19-19:31:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 31:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:18-19:33:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 33:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:9-19:34:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 34:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:17-19:34:17" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:19-19:145:19" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 145:19</a>.</p>

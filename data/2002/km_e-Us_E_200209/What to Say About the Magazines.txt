What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Sept. 15
“Millions of people believe that ‘saints’ have special power and that it is good to pray through them. What do you think? [Allow for response.] Notice what Jesus Christ said. [Read John 14:6.] This makes some wonder about praying through ‘saints.’ This issue of The Watchtower discusses that important subject.”
Awake! Sept. 22
“Many today are concerned about terrorism, including the use of biological weapons. Do you think that human governments can rid this world of terrorism? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows what God has in mind. [Read Ezekiel 34:28.] This Awake! magazine examines some of the issues involved.”
The Watchtower Oct. 1
“Many have wondered if there will ever be an end to all the troubles we see around us​—wars, crime, and acts of terror. What do you think? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives this comforting assurance. [Read Psalm 37:10, 11.] This magazine explains why God has not yet put an end to evil and the suffering it causes.”
Awake! Oct. 8
“Today there seems to be a dramatic increase in the number of single-parent families. The Bible shows that our Creator has compassion for them. [Read Psalm 146:9.] This issue of Awake! shows how Bible principles can help single parents to raise their children successfully.”

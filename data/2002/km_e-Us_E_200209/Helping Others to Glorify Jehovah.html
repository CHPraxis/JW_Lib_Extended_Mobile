<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A vital message is being proclaimed to people throughout the earth: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6, 7</a>) It is our privilege to share in that proclamation. What do people need to know about Jehovah in order to fear and worship him?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>His Name: </strong>People need to be able to distinguish by name the only true God from the many false gods worshiped today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:35-5:4:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 4:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>) In fact, Bible writers used Jehovah’s illustrious name more than 7,000 times. While we properly use discernment as to when we introduce God’s name, we should never hide it or shy away from using it. God’s will is that all mankind come to know his name.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>His Personality: </strong>To glorify Jehovah, people need to know what kind of God he is. We must acquaint them with his outstanding love, superlative wisdom, complete justice, and almighty power, along with his mercy, loving-kindness, and other wonderful qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7</a>) They must also learn to have a wholesome fear of God, to hold him in awe, recognizing that their very lives depend on having Jehovah’s approval.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:7-19:89:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 89:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Drawing Close to God: </strong>To be saved through God’s coming judgment, people must call on Jehovah in faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:8-53:1:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:8</a>) This involves more than simply gaining a knowledge of God’s name and qualities. We must help people develop a personal relationship with Jehovah, trusting in him with all their heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) As they apply what they learn, turn to God in earnest prayer, and experience his hand in their lives, their faith will grow, helping them to draw close to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 34:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>May we zealously declare God’s name and help others to put their full trust in him and to fear him. We may yet be able to help many more come to know Jehovah and glorify him as their “God of salvation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:5-19:25:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 25:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year a woman in upstate New York, U.S.A., reported making such a find. In her letter addressed “To Whom It May Concern,” she wrote: “I found this little book in a local church basement, so I took it home. It is entitled <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.”</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The woman explained: “As of today, I have four chapters to go to finish reading the book through the second time. It was so interesting that I had to read it the second time, and slower, to make everything sink in. I have learned more from that book than I ever have in my local church. And I learned things that I never knew before. I wish I had more little books like that one.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The book found was published by Jehovah’s Witnesses 20 years ago, and over 81 million copies of it were printed in 112 languages. Although it is out of print, you can find the core of its message in the 32-page brochures entitled <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>and <em>Does God Really Care About Us?</em></p>

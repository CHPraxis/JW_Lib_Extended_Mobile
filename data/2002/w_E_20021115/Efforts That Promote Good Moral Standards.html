<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Late in 2001, those tuned to Radio Mozambique’s national broadcast heard this announcement:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The president of the Republic visited the branch facilities of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Maputo. He encouraged this religious congregation to intensify their efforts in promoting good moral standards among families and in the education of adults through their literacy programs. About 10,000 people have already benefited from these programs. According to President Chissano, incentives like these are to be praised, as they are a valuable contribution to society in solving the educational problems that this country still faces.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The announcement continued with the following recorded excerpt from the president’s speech: “It is very encouraging for us to see the interest of many people in literacy. It shows us that members of the civil sector are going to help us to overcome these low literacy indexes. Therefore, I would just like to encourage Jehovah’s Witnesses to intensify their literacy programs, in whatever language. What is really important is that there is literacy and that people can communicate more easily and in the future have a greater participation in education.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mozambique hold literacy classes in 850 places nationwide in order that people can read God’s Word for themselves. In addition, they conduct some 50,000 free home Bible studies each week. All of this is part of a worldwide Bible educational program that now reaches into 235 lands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) You too can benefit from this program. Please feel free to contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your locality.</p>

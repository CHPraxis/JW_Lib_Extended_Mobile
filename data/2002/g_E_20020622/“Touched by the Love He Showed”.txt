“Touched by the Love He Showed”
In a letter addressed to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Yugoslavia, a man from the city of Nis wrote:
“I take this opportunity to thank you. Each day I read several chapters of the Bible, and I find pleasure in doing so. These days I also read the brochure What Does God Require of Us? I would like to thank you for such a wonderful tool for understanding the Bible. Everything in the brochure is explained in a very simple and understandable way.
“Especially appealing to me is the lesson that tells about Jesus Christ. I was touched by the love he showed, giving his perfect life for people that he did not even know. Everybody should appreciate his sacrifice and should be grateful for it.”
We believe that you too will benefit from reading the 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? Besides its appealing lesson “Who Is Jesus Christ?” you will find others, including “Who Is God?,” “What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?,” and “What Is the Kingdom of God?” If you would like to request a copy, fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.
□ Send me a copy of the brochure What Does God Require of Us?
□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.

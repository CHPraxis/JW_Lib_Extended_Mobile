<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a letter addressed to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Yugoslavia, a man from the city of Nis wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I take this opportunity to thank you. Each day I read several chapters of the Bible, and I find pleasure in doing so. These days I also read the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>I would like to thank you for such a wonderful tool for understanding the Bible. Everything in the brochure is explained in a very simple and understandable way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Especially appealing to me is the lesson that tells about Jesus Christ. I was touched by the love he showed, giving his perfect life for people that he did not even know. Everybody should appreciate his sacrifice and should be grateful for it.”</p>

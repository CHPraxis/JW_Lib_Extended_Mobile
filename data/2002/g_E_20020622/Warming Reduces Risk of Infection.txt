Warming Reduces Risk of Infection
THE RISK OF WOUND INFECTION AFTER SURGERY is an ever-present problem. However, “warming patients before routine operations can cut the risk of infection by more than 60 per cent,” reports The Times of London.
Researchers at the University Hospital of North Tees, England, divided over 400 patients who were about to have breast, varicose-vein, or hernia surgery into three groups. One group received no warming, and the other two groups had either localized or general warming for at least half an hour before their operations. What was the result?
Postoperatively, only 5 percent of the warmed patients suffered wound infections, compared with 14 percent of those unwarmed. It is noteworthy that warming has already proved effective in reducing infection rates for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

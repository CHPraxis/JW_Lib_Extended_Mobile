<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>When John saw the “great crowd” rendering sacred service in Jehovah’s temple, in which part of the temple were they doing this?<wbr />—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 7:9-15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is reasonable to say that the great crowd worships Jehovah in one of the earthly courtyards of his great spiritual temple, specifically the one that corresponds with the outer courtyard of Solomon’s temple.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In times past, it has been said that the great crowd is in a spiritual equivalent, or an antitype, of the Court of the Gentiles that existed in Jesus’ day. However, further research has revealed at least five reasons why that is not so. First, not all features of Herod’s temple have an antitype in Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. For example, Herod’s temple had a Court of the Women and a Court of Israel. Both men and women could enter the Court of the Women, but only men were allowed into the Court of Israel. In the earthly courtyards of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple, men and women are not separated in their worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:28-48:3:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 3:28, 29</a>) Hence, there is no equivalent of the Court of the Women and the Court of Israel in the spiritual temple.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Second, there was no Court of the Gentiles in the divinely provided architectural plans of Solomon’s temple or Ezekiel’s visionary temple; nor was there one in the temple rebuilt by Zerubbabel. Hence, there is no reason to suggest that a Court of the Gentiles needs to play a part in Jehovah’s great spiritual temple arrangement for worship, especially when the following point is considered.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Third, the Court of the Gentiles was built by the Edomite King Herod to glorify himself and to curry favor with Rome. Herod set about renovating Zerubbabel’s temple perhaps in 18 or 17 B.C.E. <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary </em>explains: “The classical tastes of the imperial power to the West [Rome] . . . mandated a temple larger than those of comparable eastern cities.” However, the dimensions of the temple proper were already established. The dictionary explains: “While the Temple itself would have to have the same dimensions as its predecessors [Solomon’s and Zerubbabel’s], the Temple Mount was not restricted in its potential size.” Hence, Herod expanded the temple area by adding on what in modern times has been called the Court of the Gentiles. Why would a construction with such a background have an antitype in Jehovah’s spiritual temple arrangement?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Fourth, almost anyone<wbr />—the blind, the lame, and uncircumcised Gentiles—<wbr />could enter the Court of the Gentiles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:14-40:21:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 21:14, 15</a>) True, the court served a purpose for many uncircumcised Gentiles who wished to make offerings to God. And it was there that Jesus sometimes addressed the crowds and twice expelled the money changers and merchants, saying that they had dishonored the house of his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:12-40:21:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 21:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:2:14-43:2:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 2:14-16</a>) Still, <em>The Jewish Encyclopedia </em>says: “This outer court was, strictly speaking, not a part of the Temple. Its soil was not sacred, and it might be entered by any one.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Fifth, the Greek word (<em>hi·e·ron’</em>) translated “temple” that is used with reference to the Court of the Gentiles “refers to the entire complex, <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>rather than specifically to the Temple building itself,” says <em>A Handbook on the Gospel of Matthew, </em>by Barclay M. Newman and Philip C. Stine. In contrast, the Greek word (<em>na·os’</em>) translated “temple” in John’s vision of the great crowd is more specific. In the context of the Jerusalem temple, it usually refers to the Holy of Holies, the temple building, or the temple precincts. It is sometimes rendered “sanctuary.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:5-40:27:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 27:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:51-40:27:51" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:9-42:1:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Luke 1:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:21-42:1:21" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:2:20-43:2:20" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> John 2:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Members of the great crowd exercise faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. They are spiritually clean, having “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Hence, they are declared righteous with a view to becoming friends of God and of surviving the great tribulation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 2:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:25-59:2:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 25</a>) In many ways, they are like proselytes in Israel who submitted to the Law covenant and worshiped along with the Israelites.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Of course, those proselytes did not serve in the inner courtyard, where the priests performed their duties. And members of the great crowd are not in the inner courtyard of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple, which courtyard represents the condition of perfect, righteous human sonship of the members of Jehovah’s “holy priesthood” while they are on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:5-60:2:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:5</a>) But as the heavenly elder said to John, the great crowd really is in the temple, not outside the temple area in a kind of spiritual Court of the Gentiles. What a privilege that is! And how it highlights the need for each one to maintain spiritual and moral purity at all times!</p>

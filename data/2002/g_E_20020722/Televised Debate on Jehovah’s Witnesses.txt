Televised Debate on Jehovah’s Witnesses
During 2000 and 2001, an attack was mounted against Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country of Georgia, a former republic of the Soviet Union. A popular television station in Georgia televised a debate between a politician who called for a ban on the Witnesses and a professor who had been appointed by the court to study Witness literature.
Answering a barrage of accusations regarding the beliefs of the Witnesses, the professor protested that the politician’s claims were “empty talk.” Then he said: “Here’s what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe,” as he held up a copy of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life for the television audience to see.
The professor then proceeded to read the first paragraph of the book, which concludes with the words: “For many, however, life seems to present one serious problem after another. If that has been your experience, take heart.”
This publication points to Bible answers to questions that many people have. For example, among its chapter titles are: “Who Is the True God?,” “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and “Why Does God Permit Suffering?”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During 2000 and 2001, an attack was mounted against Jehovah’s Witnesses in the country of Georgia, a former republic of the Soviet Union. A popular television station in Georgia televised a debate between a politician who called for a ban on the Witnesses and a professor who had been appointed by the court to study Witness literature.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Answering a barrage of accusations regarding the beliefs of the Witnesses, the professor protested that the politician’s claims were “empty talk.” Then he said: “Here’s what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe,” as he held up a copy of the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>for the television audience to see.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The professor then proceeded to read the first paragraph of the book, which concludes with the words: “For many, however, life seems to present one serious problem after another. If that has been your experience, take heart.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This publication points to Bible answers to questions that many people have. For example, among its chapter titles are: “Who Is the True God?,” “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and “Why Does God Permit Suffering?”</p>

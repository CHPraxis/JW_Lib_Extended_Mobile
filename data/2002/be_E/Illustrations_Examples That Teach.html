<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">ILLUSTRATIONS and examples are powerful teaching devices. They often command and hold attention with remarkable effectiveness. They stimulate the thinking faculties. They stir up emotions and thus may reach the conscience and the heart. At times, illustrations may be used to overcome prejudice. They are also an effective memory aid. Do you use them in your teaching?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Figures of speech are illustrations that usually require only a few words; yet they can paint vivid mental images. When they are chosen carefully, much of their meaning is self-evident. But a teacher may reinforce their value by adding a brief explanation. The Bible is filled with examples from which you can learn.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong><em>Start With Similes and Metaphors. </em></strong>Similes are the simplest figure of speech. If you are just learning to use illustrations, you may find it helpful to start with these. They are usually introduced with the word “like” or “as.” While comparing two things that are quite different, similes highlight something these have in common. The Bible is rich with figurative speech that draws on created things<wbr />—plants, animals, and heavenly bodies—<wbr />as well as human experience. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:3-19:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 1:3</a>, we are told that a person who regularly reads God’s Word is “like a tree planted by streams of water,” a tree that is fruitful and does not wither. The wicked one is said to be “like a lion” that lies in wait to seize prey. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:10:9-19:10:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 10:9</a>) Jehovah promised Abraham that his seed would become “like the stars of the heavens” for number and “like the grains of sand that are on the seashore.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:17-1:22:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17</a>) Regarding the close relationship that Jehovah made possible between himself and the nation of Israel, God said: “Just as a belt clings to the hips of a man,” so He caused Israel and Judah to cling to Him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:13:11-24:13:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 13:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Metaphors too highlight a similarity between two very different things. But the metaphor is more forceful. It speaks as though the <span id="page241" class="pageNum" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>one thing <em>were </em>the other, and thus it imparts some quality from one thing to the other. Jesus said to his disciples: “You are the light of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:14-40:5:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14</a>) Describing the damage that can be done by uncontrolled speech, the disciple James wrote: “The tongue is a fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:6-59:3:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 3:6</a>) To Jehovah, David sang: “You are my crag and my stronghold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:31:3-19:31:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 31:3</a>) A metaphor that is well chosen usually needs little or no explanation. Its forcefulness is enhanced by its brevity. A metaphor can help your audience to remember a point in a way that a simple statement of fact does not.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Hyperbole is exaggeration, which must be used discreetly or it could be misunderstood. Jesus used this figure of speech to paint an unforgettable picture when he asked: “Why . . . do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:3-40:7:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 7:3</a>) Before you try to use this or other figures of speech, learn to make effective use of the simile and the metaphor.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong><em>Use Examples. </em></strong>Instead of using a figure of speech, you may choose to employ examples, whether fictional narratives or real-life experiences, as teaching aids. These tend to get out of hand, so they need to be handled well. Such examples should be used only to support points that are truly important, and they ought to be presented in such a way that the point of instruction is remembered, not merely the story.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Although not all examples have to be actual occurrences, they should reflect true-life attitudes or situations. Thus, when teaching how repentant sinners ought to be viewed, Jesus illustrated his point by telling about the rejoicing of a man who found his lost sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:15:1-42:15:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 15:1-7</a>) In reply to a man who was failing to get the full import of what the Law meant by the command to love one’s neighbor, Jesus related a story about a Samaritan who helped an injured man after a priest and a Levite failed to do so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:30-42:10:37" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 10:30-37</a>) If you learn to be a keen observer of people’s attitudes and actions, you can make effective use of this teaching device.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The prophet Nathan related an imaginary situation as a means of reproving King David. The story was effective because it avoided a situation that might have led David to react with self-justification. <span id="page242" class="pageNum" data-no="242" data-before-text="242"></span>The story involved a rich man who had many sheep and a man of little means who had just one female lamb that he was raising with tender care. David himself had been a shepherd, so he could understand the feelings of the owner of that lamb. David reacted with righteous indignation against the rich man who had seized the poor man’s cherished lamb. Then Nathan straightforwardly said to David: “You yourself are the man!” David’s heart was reached, and he sincerely repented. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:12:1-10:12:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:1-14</a>) With practice, you can learn to deal with emotional issues in an appealing manner.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Many examples that are valuable for teaching can be drawn from events recorded in the Scriptures. Jesus did this in a few words when he said: “Remember the wife of Lot.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:32-42:17:32" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 17:32</a>) When detailing the sign of his presence, Jesus referred to “the days of Noah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37-39</a>) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:40" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews chapter 11</a>, the apostle Paul referred to 16 men and women by name as examples of faith. As you become well acquainted with the Bible, you will be able to draw powerful examples from what the Scriptures say about the events and people named in its pages.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:11-46:10:11" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">At times you may find it beneficial to reinforce a point of instruction with a real-life, modern-day experience. When doing this, however, be careful to use only experiences that have been verified and to avoid those that would unnecessarily embarrass anyone in your audience or that would draw attention to a controversial subject that is not at issue. Remember, too, that the experience should serve a purpose. Do not relate needless details that tend to divert attention from the objective of your presentation.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Will It Be Understood? </em></strong>Whatever illustration or example you use, it ought to accomplish some definite objective. Will it do that if you do not make application of it to the subject under discussion?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">After referring to his disciples as “the light of the world,” Jesus added a few remarks about how a lamp is used and what responsibility this implied for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:15-40:5:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 5:15, 16</a>) He followed up his illustration of the lost sheep with a comment about the joy in heaven over a sinner who repents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:15:7-42:15:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 15:7</a>) And after his story about the neighborly Samaritan, Jesus asked his listener a pointed question and followed it up with some direct counsel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:36-42:10:37" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 10:36, 37</a>) In contrast, Jesus explained his illustration about the various kinds of soil and the one about the weeds in the field only to those humble enough to <span id="page243" class="pageNum" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span>ask, not to the crowds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:1-40:13:30" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 13:1-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:36-40:13:43" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 36-43</a>) Three days before his death, Jesus spoke an illustration about murderous vineyard cultivators. He made no application; none was needed. “The chief priests and the Pharisees . . . took note that he was speaking about them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:33-40:21:45" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 21:33-45</a>) So the nature of the illustration, the attitude of the audience, and your objective all have a bearing on whether application is required and, if so, how much.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Developing the ability to use illustrations and examples effectively takes time, but the effort is well worth it. Well-chosen illustrations couple intellectual appeal with emotional impact. The result is that the message is conveyed with a force that is not often possible with simple statements of fact.</p>

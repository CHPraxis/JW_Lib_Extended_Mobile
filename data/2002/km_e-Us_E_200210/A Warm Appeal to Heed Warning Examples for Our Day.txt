A Warm Appeal to Heed Warning Examples for Our Day
All of us can fortify our determination to maintain our integrity by taking to heart the lessons learned from the Bible drama portrayed in the video Warning Examples for Our Day. Before watching it, please read Numbers chapter 25 and the background material in Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2, page 419, paragraphs 3-5. Then answer these questions: Who were the Moabites, and why did Jehovah tell Moses not to wage war against them? (Deut. 2:9) How did Balaam scheme to use the Moabites to destroy the nation of Israel? Why should we not forget that many Israelites failed a vital test just before entering the Promised Land?​—1 Cor. 10:11, 12.
While watching the Warning Examples video, think about the following four areas of life that we must give serious attention to today if we are to prove faithful and enjoy God’s favor. (1) Attitude: How had some Israelites shown a wrong attitude toward Jehovah and his arrangements? Instead, what attitude should we strive to reflect? (2) Associations: Why did Jehovah not want the Israelites to become friends with the Moabites? (Ex. 34:12; Prov. 13:20) Why must we choose our friends wisely? (3) Morals: Into what serious sin did bad associations lead some 23,000 Israelites? (1 Cor. 10:8) Today, what has lured some of God’s people into committing immorality, but how can we protect ourselves? (4) Worship: How were the Israelites tested as to the purity of their worship? To what subtle form of idolatry might some succumb today, but how can we avoid it?​—Col. 3:5.
In the drama, how was Jamin blessed for his moral integrity? By means of this video, what warm appeal is the Governing Body making to all true Christians? If you are a family head, why do you feel it would be wise for your household to view this program again and again?

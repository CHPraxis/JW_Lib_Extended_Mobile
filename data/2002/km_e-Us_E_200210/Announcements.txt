Announcements
▪ Literature offer for October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies. November: What Does God Require of Us? or Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. If people already have these, an older publication may be offered. You may check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand if you do not have any in stock. December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. If the congregation does not have a supply of any of the alternative offers, please check to see if any nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. January: Any book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Mankind’s Search for God.

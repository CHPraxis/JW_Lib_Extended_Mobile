Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2003
Instructions
During 2003 the following will be the arrangements for conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], The Watchtower [w], Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education [be], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], and Reasoning From the Scriptures (1989 Edition) [rs].
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:
SPEECH QUALITY: 5 minutes. The school overseer, the auxiliary counselor, or another qualified elder will discuss a speech quality based on the Ministry School textbook. (In congregations with a limited number of elders, a qualified ministerial servant may be used.) Unless otherwise indicated, the boxes appearing on the assigned pages should be included in the discussion. The exercises should be omitted. These are primarily for personal use and private counsel.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 10 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on The Watchtower, Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education, or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” It is to be delivered as a ten-minute instruction talk with no oral review. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used. It is expected that brothers assigned this talk will be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given as needed.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 10 minutes. For the first six minutes, a qualified elder or ministerial servant should effectively apply the material to local needs. He may comment on any portion of the assigned Bible reading for the week, since the brother handling the No. 2 assignment will not be commenting on the verses he reads. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. The principal objective is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value. Thereafter, for four minutes the speaker will invite the audience to participate by offering brief comments (30 seconds or less) on the following two questions: “What did you find in the Bible reading this week that will benefit you in your ministry or way of life?” and “What strengthened your faith and built your appreciation for Jehovah?” The school overseer will then dismiss the students who are assigned to other classrooms.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 4 minutes. This is a reading to be given by a brother. The reading will usually be from the Bible. Once a month this assignment will cover material drawn from The Watchtower. The student should read the assigned material without giving an introduction or a conclusion. From week to week, the amount of material to be read will vary slightly but should take four minutes or less. The school overseer should look over the material before making the assignments, matching such to the age and ability of the students. The school overseer will be especially interested in helping students to read with understanding, fluency, proper sense stress, modulation, appropriate pausing, and naturalness.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. Students receiving this assignment will either select a setting or be assigned one from the list appearing on page 82 of the Ministry School textbook. The student should use the assigned theme and apply it to an aspect of field service that is realistic and practical for the territory of the local congregation. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in publications provided by the faithful and discreet slave class. Newer students should be assigned talks for which references are supplied. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the material and the way she helps the householder to reason on the Scriptures and to understand the key points of the presentation. Students assigned this part should know how to read. The school overseer will assign one assistant.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. The student should develop the assigned theme. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in publications provided by the faithful and discreet slave class. When assigned to a brother, this part may be given as a talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should always be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3. Please note that subjects with asterisks should be assigned only to brothers to give as talks.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime, nor should the remarks of the counselor. Assignments No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If brothers handling the opening talk on a speech quality, Assignment No. 1, or highlights from the Bible reading go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.
COUNSEL: 1 minute. The school overseer will take no more than one minute after each student presentation to offer some positive observations on an aspect of the talk that was commendable. His aim is not simply to say “well done” but, rather, to draw attention to specific reasons why that aspect of the presentation was effective. According to the need of each student, additional constructive counsel may be given privately after the meeting or at another time.
AUXILIARY COUNSELOR: The body of elders may select a capable elder, if one is available in addition to the school overseer, to handle the assignment as auxiliary counselor. His responsibility will be to give private counsel, if needed, to brothers who present Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights. It is not necessary that he offer counsel after each of such talks by fellow elders or ministerial servants. This arrangement will be in effect during 2003 and may be adjusted thereafter.
COUNSEL FORM: In textbook.
ORAL REVIEW: 30 minutes. Every two months, the school overseer will conduct an oral review. It will be preceded by the consideration of a speech quality and highlights from the Bible reading as outlined above. The oral review will be based on material considered in the school over the preceding two months, including the current week.

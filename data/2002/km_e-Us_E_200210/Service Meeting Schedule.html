(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 1:16</a>) Youth approaches father with a problem. Young person is reluctant to be identified as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses because of fear of being ridiculed by peers. Father thanks youth for being honest about the matter. He relates how Peter once reacted because of peer pressure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:69-40:26:74" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:69-74</a>) Father offers the following advice: We should never be ashamed of who we are as Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:38-41:8:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 8:38</a>) It is advantageous to identify yourself as a Witness at school. When informed, many teachers will respect your beliefs and not try to involve you in activities you find objectionable. Unprincipled youths are not as likely to try to pressure you into misconduct. Other classmates will more readily understand why you choose not to date, participate in extracurricular sports, or share in after-school activities. As time permits, the father and youth discuss points from the subheading “Publicly Declaring Your Friendship With God” in the <em>Young People Ask </em>book, pages 315-18. Teenager expresses appreciation for the good advice.</p>

Invite congregation to relate how they have been able to apply what they learned. (Portions can be assigned in advance.) Highlight the following program parts: (1) “Subjection to God in an Enslaved World.” Why must we be alert to avoid worldly snares? (2) “Manifesting Godly Subjection as Family Members.” Why is there an urgent need within Jehovah’s organization to strengthen family ties? How can we do so? (3) “Help New Disciples to Stand Firm on Jehovah’s Side.” How can we help new ones overcome obstacles that test their faith? (4) “What It Means to Oppose the Devil.” What is the key to standing successfully against the Devil? How can the spiritual armor described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:11-18</a> protect us? (<em>w</em>92 5/15 21-3) (5) “Youths Who Successfully Resist the Wicked One” and “Youths Who Benefit From Godly Subjection.” What are some of Satan’s devices that young people must guard against? How are young ones blessed by subjecting themselves to Jehovah? (<a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:1990563/21-23"><em>w</em>90 8/1 13-14, pars. 15-17</a>) (6) “Benefiting From Godly Subjection.” Explain how Christians demonstrate subjection to governmental authorities, to secular employers, in the family circle, and in the Christian congregation. What qualities will help us to do so?</p>

What to Say About the Magazines
The Watchtower Oct. 15
“How would you explain to children or others why so many bad things happen today? [Allow for response.] The Bible answers the question, ‘Who Is Behind All Evil?’ [Read 1 John 5:19.] This issue of The Watchtower will help you to understand who that wicked one is and how we can oppose him.”
Awake! Oct. 22
“Do you think that the prayers of religious leaders or anyone else can bring about world peace? [Allow for response.] The Bible promises a time of global peace. [Read Isaiah 9:6, 7.] Did you notice that a special ruler would bring about world peace? This issue of Awake! shows who that ruler is and how he will bring genuine peace.”
The Watchtower Nov. 1
“Many of us try to have peaceful relations with others. But you will likely agree that it is often easier said than done. [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why this is so. [Read James 3:2.] This article shows how an apology may be the key to restoring and maintaining peace.”
Awake! Nov. 8
“Bible prophecy indicates that a time is coming when no one will say, ‘I am sick.’ [Read Isaiah 33:24.] Wouldn’t that be wonderful? [Allow for response.] However, today mankind is afflicted with many diseases, including the plague of AIDS. This issue of Awake! answers the question, Will AIDS ever be halted?”

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“How would you explain to children or others why so many bad things happen today? [Allow for response.] The Bible answers the question, ‘Who Is Behind All Evil?’ [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>.] This issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>will help you to understand who that wicked one is and how we can oppose him.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>Awake! Oct. 22</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Do you think that the prayers of religious leaders or anyone else can bring about world peace? [Allow for response.] The Bible promises a time of global peace. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>.] Did you notice that a special ruler would bring about world peace?

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Many of us try to have peaceful relations with others. But you will likely agree that it is often easier said than done. [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why this is so. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>.] This article shows how an apology may be the key to restoring and maintaining peace.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>Awake! Nov. 8</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“Bible prophecy indicates that a time is coming when no one will say, ‘I am sick.’ [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>.] Wouldn’t that be wonderful? [Allow for response.] However, today mankind is afflicted with many diseases, including the plague of AIDS. This issue of <em>Awake! </em>answers the question, Will AIDS ever be halted?”</p>

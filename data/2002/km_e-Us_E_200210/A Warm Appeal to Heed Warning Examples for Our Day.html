<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">All of us can fortify our determination to maintain our integrity by taking to heart the lessons learned from the Bible drama portrayed in the video <em>Warning Examples for Our Day. </em>Before watching it, please read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:1-4:25:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers chapter 25</a> and the background material in <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1200003097/4:393-10:87"><em>Insight on the Scriptures, </em>Volume 2, page 419, paragraphs 3-5</a>. Then answer these questions: Who were the Moabites, and why did Jehovah tell Moses not to wage war against them? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:9-5:2:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 2:9</a>) How did Balaam scheme to use the Moabites to destroy the nation of Israel? Why should we not forget that many Israelites failed a vital test just before entering the Promised Land?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:11-46:10:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While watching the <em>Warning Examples </em>video, think about the following four areas of life that we must give serious attention to today if we are to prove faithful and enjoy God’s favor. <strong>(1) Attitude: </strong>How had some Israelites shown a wrong attitude toward Jehovah and his arrangements? Instead, what attitude should we strive to reflect? <strong>(2) Associations: </strong>Why did Jehovah not want the Israelites to become friends with the Moabites? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:12-2:34:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 34:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 13:20</a>) Why must we choose our friends wisely? <strong>(3) Morals: </strong>Into what serious sin did bad associations lead some 23,000 Israelites? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:8-46:10:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:8</a>) Today, what has lured some of God’s people into committing immorality, but how can we protect ourselves? <strong>(4) Worship: </strong>How were the Israelites tested as to the purity of their worship? To what subtle form of idolatry might some succumb today, but how can we avoid it?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the drama, how was Jamin blessed for his moral integrity? By means of this video, what warm appeal is the Governing Body making to all true Christians? If you are a family head, why do you feel it would be wise for your household to view this program again and again?</p>

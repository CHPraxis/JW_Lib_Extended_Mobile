“Frequently Consulted by Students”
A LIBRARIAN from Divinópolis, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, wrote to the offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil about the keen interest that students have shown in Awake! magazine. He explained:
“At the municipal school library where I work, we occasionally receive donations of books and magazines published by [Jehovah’s Witnesses]. Although hardly any of the students here are Jehovah’s Witnesses, Awake! is frequently consulted by students researching a variety of subjects. The issue of September 8, 2000, for example, has proved most useful because of its informative articles on the Olympic Games. For this reason, I would like to ask you to provide us with a large quantity of different issues of Awake! I feel sure that you share my interest in providing upbuilding reading material for our young ones.”
On page 4 each issue of Awake! describes why the magazine is published. “Most important,” it explains, “this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses also provide brochures specifically designed to accomplish that purpose, one of which is entitled What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

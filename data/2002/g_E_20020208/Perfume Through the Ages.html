<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>WRITER IN MEXICO</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Perfume has an ancient history. It is thought that primitive perfumery began with the burning of gums and resins for incense in religious ceremonies. Consequently, the word “perfume” is from the Latin <em>per fumum, </em>meaning “through smoke.” An early record of perfume comes from Egypt. When Pharaoh Tutankhamen’s tomb was opened, over 3,000 jars of perfume were found that still preserved some of their fragrance after more than 30 centuries!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Fifteen hundred years before the Common Era, “the choicest perfumes” were included in the divinely given formula for the holy anointing oil used by Israelite priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:30:23-2:30:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 30:23-33</a>) Perfumed ointments were used by the Hebrews for cosmetic and medicinal purposes, as well as for preparing the dead for burial—no doubt serving as disinfectants and deodorants. For example, women took spices and perfumed oils to the tomb to use on Jesus’ body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:56-42:23:56" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 23:56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:1-42:24:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24:1</a>) In the Israelite home, greasing the feet of a guest with perfumed oil was considered an act of hospitality.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:7:37-42:7:46" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 7:37-46</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the first century, Rome reportedly used about 2,800 tons of frankincense and 550 tons of myrrh a year. Such aromatic ingredients were taken to the child Jesus as gifts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:1-40:2:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:11-40:2:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11</a>) In 54 C.E., it is said, Roman Emperor Nero spent the equivalent of $100,000 in order to scent a party. Pipes concealed in his dining rooms sprayed the guests with mists of perfumed water. From the seventh century C.E. onward, the Chinese made use of fragrances, including perfumed sachets. During the Middle Ages, perfumes were used in the Islamic culture, especially rose scents.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The perfume industry became so well established in France during the 18th century that the court of Louis XV was called the perfumed court. Scents were applied not only to the skin but also to clothing, gloves, fans, and furniture.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Cologne, invented in the 18th century, was used in bath water, was mixed with wine, was eaten on a sugar lump as a mouthwash, and was used medicinally in enemas and poultices. In the 19th century, synthetic fragrances were developed. Thus, the first perfumes not suitable for medicinal use began to be marketed. Today perfumery is a multibillion-dollar business.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

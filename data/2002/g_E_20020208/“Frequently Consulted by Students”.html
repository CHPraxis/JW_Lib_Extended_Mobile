<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A LIBRARIAN from Divinópolis, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, wrote to the offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil about the keen interest that students have shown in <em>Awake! </em>magazine. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“At the municipal school library where I work, we occasionally receive donations of books and magazines published by [Jehovah’s Witnesses]. Although hardly any of the students here are Jehovah’s Witnesses, <em>Awake! </em>is frequently consulted by students researching a variety of subjects. The issue of September 8, 2000, for example, has proved most useful because of its informative articles on the Olympic Games. For this reason, I would like to ask you to provide us with a large quantity of different issues of <em>Awake! </em>I feel sure that you share my interest in providing upbuilding reading material for our young ones.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On page 4 each issue of <em>Awake! </em>describes why the magazine is published. “Most important,” it explains, “this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses also provide brochures specifically designed to accomplish that purpose, one of which is entitled <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">□ Send me a copy of the brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It?</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">□ Please contact me concerning a free home Bible study.</p>

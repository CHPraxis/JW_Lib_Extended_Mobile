<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">• <strong>How can “thinking ability” prove to be a safeguard? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:4-20:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 1:4</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">It can alert us to spiritual dangers and motivate us to plan a wise course, such as avoiding sexual temptations on the job. It helps us to recognize that fellow Christians are imperfect, which can move us to avoid hasty reactions when provoked. It can also enable us to avoid materialistic pressures that might push us off track spiritually.​—8/15, pages 21-4.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">• <strong>How can one become an asset as a neighbor?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Two ways to be a fine neighbor are being a good giver and being a gracious receiver. It is valuable to be a good neighbor when adversity strikes. Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to be good neighbors by warning others of the event soon to occur, God’s act to end wickedness.​—9/1, pages 4-7.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">• <strong>According to the Bible, who are true saints, and how will they help mankind?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">All early Christians were true saints, or holy ones, made such by God, not by men or organizations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 1:7</a>) Once resurrected to heavenly life, holy ones will share with Christ in blessing faithful ones on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:18-49:1:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:18-21</a>)​—9/15, pages 5-7.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">• <strong>Knowing something about athletic events in ancient Greece may be of what value to Christians?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">The writings of the apostles Peter and Paul have illustrations based on or allusions to the ancient games. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:26-46:9:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:7-54:4:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:5-55:2:5" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:10</a>) For an ancient athlete, it was important to have a good trainer, to exercise self-control, and to direct his efforts well. The same is true with regard to the spiritual efforts of Christians today.​—10/1, pages 28-31.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">• <strong>What are the challenges and the rewards of raising children in a foreign land?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">Many children learn a new language more quickly than their parents, who may find it hard to understand their children’s thinking and reactions. And the children may not easily grasp Bible teachings in their parents’ language. Yet, family bonds can be strengthened as parents teach their tongue to their children, who may thus know two languages and feel part of two cultures.​—10/15, pages 22-6.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">• <strong>Why is learning to apologize important?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">A sincere apology is often a way to repair a damaged relationship. The Bible provides examples of the power an apology can have. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:2-9:25:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 25:2-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:1-44:23:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 23:1-5</a>) Often, when two humans are at odds, there is some blame on both sides. Therefore, mutual concessions and apologies are called for.​—11/1, pages 4-7.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">• <strong>Why is gambling, even of small amounts, bad?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Gambling can incite egotism, a competitive spirit, and greed, which the Bible condemns. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) Many who are addicted to gambling began at an early age by placing small bets.​—11/1, page 31.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">• <strong>Since many books of the Bible were written in Greek, why has there been a need for translating the Bible into Greek, and with what results?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Modern Greek is quite different from the Greek of the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures and from that of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Over recent centuries there have been numerous attempts to render some or all of the Bible into spoken Greek. Today, there are some 30 renderings of the Bible, in whole or in part, that are readable to the average Greek, a notable one being the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>published in 1997.​—11/15, pages 26-9.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">• <strong>Why is tithing not required of Christians?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">Under the Law given to ancient Israel, tithing was a means of supporting the tribe of Levi and caring for needy ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:30-3:27:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:28-5:14:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 14:28, 29</a>) The sacrificial death of Jesus abolished the Law and its tithing requirement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:13-49:2:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:13-15</a>) In the early congregation, the pattern was for each Christian to give according to his means and as he resolved in his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:5-47:9:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 7</a>)​—12/1, pages 4-6.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">• <strong>Does </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:8-66:20:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 20:8</strong></a> <strong>mean that in the final test, Satan will mislead a vast number?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">The text says that those misled will be “as the sand of the sea.” In the Bible, that expression often means an unknown number, without suggesting that it is immense. Abraham’s seed, which was to be “like the grains of sand that are on the seashore,” turned out to be 144,000 persons, aside from Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 22:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Revelation 14:1-4</a>)​—12/1, page 29.</p>

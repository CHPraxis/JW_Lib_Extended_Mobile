<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter was received last year at the Papua New Guinea branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses from a reader of <em>Awake! </em>who lives in Lae, Morobe Province. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I must earnestly admit that I made a very good decision five years ago (when I was in Port Moresby) to read the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, published by your organization. I have read every issue since 1997. My house is full of <em>Awake! </em>magazines.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I have learned a lot. My vocabulary, my general knowledge, my grammar, and my understanding of the Creator have expanded so much. I have personally become more tolerant, more considerate of others, and more focused, and I have developed more respect for plants and animals. I do recommend that more people read <em>Awake! </em>as well as your other publications.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The writer concluded: “I believe that if everybody in this world became Jehovah’s Witnesses, our dreams of Paradise would definitely become a reality overnight. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses point to the Bible’s promise that this present system of things will soon be replaced by a new world that will be ushered in by God’s Kingdom. The book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>points to that Kingdom as the answer to mankind’s problems.</p>

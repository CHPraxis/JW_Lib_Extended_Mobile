“Dreams of Paradise”
A letter was received last year at the Papua New Guinea branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses from a reader of Awake! who lives in Lae, Morobe Province. He explained:
“I must earnestly admit that I made a very good decision five years ago (when I was in Port Moresby) to read the Awake! magazine, published by your organization. I have read every issue since 1997. My house is full of Awake! magazines.
“I have learned a lot. My vocabulary, my general knowledge, my grammar, and my understanding of the Creator have expanded so much. I have personally become more tolerant, more considerate of others, and more focused, and I have developed more respect for plants and animals. I do recommend that more people read Awake! as well as your other publications.”
The writer concluded: “I believe that if everybody in this world became Jehovah’s Witnesses, our dreams of Paradise would definitely become a reality overnight. Keep up the good work.”
The publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses point to the Bible’s promise that this present system of things will soon be replaced by a new world that will be ushered in by God’s Kingdom. The book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life points to that Kingdom as the answer to mankind’s problems.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On January 12 of this year, Jesse Barnes, a master electrician, died of injuries sustained while working at a government building in Washington, D.C. He had worked there since 1995. “Everyone loved Jesse,” said one manager. An administrative assistant said of Jesse: “He was the type of person who, even if you only met him once, you remembered him.” She also noted: “He never threw his beliefs in your face, but if he heard others swearing, he’d tell them to clean up their act.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesse, who was 48 when he died, had become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1993. Two officials invited Jesse’s widow, Maureen, to visit them, and she met with them on March 20. She left each of them a copy of the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>and the video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—The Organization Behind the Name. </em>Both men expressed appreciation for the gifts. One of them said that he greatly valued the visit because he had recently lost his father and it was difficult for him.</p>

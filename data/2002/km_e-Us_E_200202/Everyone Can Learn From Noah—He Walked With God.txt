Everyone Can Learn From Noah​—He Walked With God
Read or review Genesis 6:1 to 9:19. Then watch the Noah video, and think of how you would answer these questions: (1) What was the world like in Noah’s day, and how did it get that way? (2) What made Noah so special, what task did God give him to do, and why? (3) Where was the ark probably built, how long did it take, and how large was it? (4) Besides building the ark, what else did Noah and his family have to do? (5) What do you think it was like in the ark once the door was shut? (6) How would you have felt after surviving the Flood? (7) What reminder of the Flood do we occasionally see, and what does it mean? (8) What has the Bible account of Noah taught you about yourself, your family, and the work God has assigned us to do? (9) What questions do you want to ask Noah and his family when you meet them in Paradise? (10) How do you plan to use the Noah video now?

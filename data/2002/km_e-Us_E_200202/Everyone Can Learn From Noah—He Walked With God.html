<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Read or review <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:9:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 6:1 to 9:19</a>. Then watch the <em>Noah </em>video, and think of how you would answer these questions: <strong>(1) </strong>What was the world like in Noah’s day, and how did it get that way? <strong>(2) </strong>What made Noah so special, what task did God give him to do, and why? <strong>(3) </strong>Where was the ark probably built, how long did it take, and how large was it? <strong>(4) </strong>Besides building the ark, what else did Noah and his family have to do? <strong>(5) </strong>What do you think it was like in the ark once the door was shut? <strong>(6) </strong>How would you have felt after surviving the Flood? <strong>(7) </strong>What reminder of the Flood do we occasionally see, and what does it mean? <strong>(8) </strong>What has the Bible account of Noah taught you about yourself, your family, and the work God has assigned us to do? <strong>(9) </strong>What questions do you want to ask Noah and his family when you meet them in Paradise? <strong>(10) </strong>How do you plan to use the <em>Noah </em>video now?</p>

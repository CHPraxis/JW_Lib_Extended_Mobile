<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LAST year a woman wrote: “Yesterday I received the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>that I requested in the mail.” She explained that earlier she had received two advertisements for the brochure. “I anxiously awaited its arrival because after reading the advertisements, I knew that I had to know more,” she said. “Upon receiving the brochure, I began reading it as soon as I could. Everything in your brochure makes sense and is from the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She concluded: “I feel an urgency to do something with what I’ve read.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We believe that you too will benefit from reading the 32-page brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>Besides its appealing lesson “Who Is Jesus Christ?” you will find others, including “Who Is God?,” “What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?,” and “What Is the Kingdom of God?” If you would like to request a copy, fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

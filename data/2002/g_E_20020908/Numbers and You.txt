Numbers and You
DO NUMBERS have hidden meaning? “Of course!” some exclaim, pointing to an intriguing example—the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
“The moment I heard the news,” says one numerologist, “I noticed the date: 9-11-2001.” The number 11 is generally considered to be one of the “master numbers” by numerologists. So numerology enthusiasts have compiled a list of various items related to the terrorist attack that point to the “master number” 11. This is just a portion of what they found:
▪ The tragedy occurred on the date 9/11. 9 + 1 + 1 = 11.
▪ September 11 was the 254th day of the year. 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
▪ The airplane that hit the north tower was Flight 11.
▪ That flight had 92 people on board. 9 + 2 = 11.
▪ The airplane that hit the south tower had 65 passengers. 6 + 5 = 11.
▪ The Twin Towers resembled the number 11.
▪ In English the expression “New York City” has 11 letters.
Numerology—in which special significance is attached to figures, their combinations, and numerical totals—has been a widespread practice in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Why the allure? According to one Web site, decoding the letters of the alphabet used in names—one popular aspect of numerology—“yields accurate information concerning personality, nature, qualities and shortcomings.” According to this source, studying our “date of birth uncovers our life path, with its joys and trials.”
Are these claims true? Or could there be hidden dangers in the metaphysical study of numbers?

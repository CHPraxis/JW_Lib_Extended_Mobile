<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DOES the untrustworthiness of numerology and other forms of divination mean that we have no way to learn about our future? By no means!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Abstract numbers cannot tell mankind what the future holds. But the “living God,” who declares “from the beginning the finale,” has done so. This he does in his written Word, the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isaiah 46:10</a>) It is also the word of the living God, not the word of numerologists, that “is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart” and so can help you to understand what motivates you and what will bring you real success.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Our Creator, the Author of the Bible, is the only one who can accurately predict the future. This is because God is all-powerful, and he has always been true to his word. “I have even spoken it,” Jehovah God said. “I shall also do it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:11-23:46:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:11</a>) After leading the Israelites into the Promised Land, Joshua was able to say with confidence: “Not a promise failed out of all the good promise that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; it all came true.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:21:45-6:21:45" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 21:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 23:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible contains many prophecies that are yet to be fulfilled. Among them are those that foretell a time when the earth will be wiped clean of wickedness and made into a paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>) Does that future appeal to you? Do you believe that our Creator has the wisdom and the power to make things right on this planet? If so, you will want to consider what the Bible says about earth’s future.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Therefore, spend your time wisely now<wbr />—not by trying to read your future in the numbers but by striving to gain an accurate understanding of the Bible and its prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses are ready to help you to gain further knowledge about the future as revealed in God’s Word, the Bible.</p>

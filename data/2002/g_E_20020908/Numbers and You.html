<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DO NUMBERS have hidden meaning? “Of course!” some exclaim, pointing to an intriguing example<wbr />—the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The moment I heard the news,” says one numerologist, “I noticed the date: 9-11-2001.” The number 11 is generally considered to be one of the “master numbers” by numerologists. So numerology enthusiasts have compiled a list of various items related to the terrorist attack that point to the “master number” 11. This is just a portion of what they found:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">▪ The tragedy occurred on the date 9/11. <strong>9 + 1 + 1 = 11.</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">▪ September 11 was the 254th day of the year. <strong>2 + 5 + 4 = 11.</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">▪ The airplane that hit the north tower was <strong>Flight 11.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">▪ That flight had 92 people on board. <strong>9 + 2 = 11.</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">▪ The airplane that hit the south tower had 65 passengers. <strong>6 + 5 = 11.</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">▪ The Twin Towers resembled the number <strong>11.</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">▪ In English the expression “New York City” has <strong>11 </strong>letters.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Numerology<wbr />—in which special significance is attached to figures, their combinations, and numerical totals—<wbr />has been a widespread practice in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Why the allure? According to one Web site, decoding the letters of the alphabet used in names<wbr />—one popular aspect of numerology—<wbr />“yields accurate information concerning personality, nature, qualities and shortcomings.” According to this source, studying our “date of birth uncovers our life path, with its joys and trials.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Are these claims true? Or could there be hidden dangers in the metaphysical study of numbers?</p>

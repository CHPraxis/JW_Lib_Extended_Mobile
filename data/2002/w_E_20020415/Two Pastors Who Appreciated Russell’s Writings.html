<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN 1891, Charles Taze Russell, who did outstanding work among true Christian worshipers of Jehovah, visited Europe for the first time. According to some reports, during a stopover in Pinerolo, Italy, Russell met Professor Daniele Rivoire, a former pastor of a religious group called the Waldenses.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Although Rivoire remained closely associated with the Waldenses after he left the ministry, he kept an open mind and read many publications that C. T. Russell wrote.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1903, Rivoire translated Russell’s book <em>The Divine Plan of the Ages </em>into Italian and had it printed at his own expense. This was well before an official Italian edition was published. In the book’s foreword, Rivoire wrote: “We place this first Italian edition under the Lord’s protection. May he bless it so that, in spite of its imperfections, it may contribute to magnify his most holy name and encourage his Italian-speaking children to greater devotion. May the hearts of all those who, by reading this book, appreciate the depth of riches, wisdom, and knowledge of God’s plan and love, be grateful to God himself, by whose grace publication of this work has been made possible.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Rivoire also began translating <em>Zion’s Watchtower and Herald of Christ’s Presence </em>into Italian. This magazine, an early form of <em>The Watchtower, </em>appeared as a quarterly edition in 1903. Even though Professor Rivoire never became a Bible Student, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called, he showed much interest in spreading the Bible’s message as explained in the publications of the Bible Students.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“It Seemed as Though Scales Fell From My Eyes”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Another Waldensian pastor who esteemed Russell’s publications was Giuseppe Banchetti. Giuseppe’s father, who had converted from Catholicism, gave him a Waldensian education. In 1894, Giuseppe became a pastor and ministered to various Waldensian communities in Apulia and Abruzzi and on the islands of Elba and Sicily.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The authorized Italian edition of Russell’s <em>Divine Plan of the Ages </em>was published in 1905. Banchetti wrote an enthusiastic review of the book. It appeared in the Protestant periodical <em>La Rivista Cristiana. </em>“For us,” wrote Banchetti, Russell’s book “is the most illuminated and sure guide that any Christian may find to undertake a profitable and blessed study of Holy Scripture . . . As soon as I read it, it seemed as though scales fell from my eyes, that the way to God was straighter and easier. Even apparent contradictions for the most <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>part disappeared. Doctrines once difficult appeared simple and perfectly acceptable. Things hitherto incomprehensible became clear. The admirable plan of the world’s salvation in Christ appeared before me with such awesome simplicity as to induce me to exclaim with the Apostle: O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:33-45:11:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 11:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As observed in 1925 by Remigio Cuminetti, Banchetti showed “much sympathy” for the work of the Bible Students and was “fully convinced” of the doctrines as explained by them. In his own way, Banchetti also sought to make such doctrines known.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is evident from Banchetti’s writings that, like Jehovah’s Witnesses, he believed that there would be an earthly resurrection, as taught in the Scriptures. He also agreed with the Bible Students when he explained that the year in which Jesus died had been fixed and revealed by God in Daniel’s prophecy of the 70 weeks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>) More than once, and in open disagreement with the teachings of his church, he held that the Memorial of Jesus Christ’s death should be observed just one time each year, “the exact day on which the anniversary falls.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>) He rejected Darwin’s theory of evolution, and he affirmed that true Christians should not engage in secular war.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">On one occasion, Banchetti was discussing Russell’s writings with a man named J. Campbell Wall. In answer to Wall’s criticisms, Banchetti said: “I am certain that if you read Russell’s six volumes, you would experience a vigorous and deep joy, and you would thank me with emotion. I do not parade doctrine; but I read those books eleven years ago, and I thank God every day for putting before me such light and such consolation by means of a work that is entirely and solidly founded on the Holy Scriptures.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>“Listen, Listen, Listen”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It is significant that these two Waldensian pastors​—Daniele Rivoire and Giuseppe Banchetti—​expressed appreciation for the way Russell explained the Bible. Banchetti wrote: “I say that none of us Evangelicals, not even our pastors or theology professors, nobody knows everything. Nay, we have many, many other things to learn. . . . [We should] . . . stay and listen, not thinking we know it all, and not rejecting what is offered for our examination. Rather, listen, listen, listen.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Every year, thousands listen to the Kingdom message as brought to their homes by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Open-minded people everywhere who thirst for Bible truths are responding to Jesus’ invitation: “Come be my follower.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 10:17-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 22:17</a>.</p>
